    Good route to learn trad. The couple bolts to the left allow you to weigh your gear placed, without fear of them pulling out and you falling a substantial distance.

    Led up this just to clean the anchors.  Probably one move of 5.3 and then not any harder than walking around the back.

    This route starts the same as Quicksilver (which goes straight up the face through crimps over the roof 10c?

    The guidebook calls this a 5.9+ and calls Firestarter (just to the left) a 5.10b which is opposite of what is posted here on Mountain Project. In any case, the traverse left about 15 feet up and the traverse left again under the 2nd roof to join Firestarter are definitely the cruxes, maybe harder than 5.9+ if you are shorter like me. I used 3 60mm alpine draws, 1 to protect the 1st traverse using the random bolt above, and 2 to extend around the 2nd roof to reduce rope drag. In fact, once I got over the 2nd roof and clipped the next bolt above it, I removed the draw that's just to the left of the 2nd roof. This helped quite a bit with reducing rope drag. Above the 2nd roof, the route mellows out.    In any case, this is kind of a funky route, but it is still enjoyable.

    Really enjoyed this route. Tons of fun the whole way up. We avoided the runout by placing 3 pieces of gear. It's my opinion that following the route with gear makes for a funner climb as you could run it out in a straight line and miss the fun roof. Would say this one was second favorite at this area. Not difficult at all for the grade.

    Not worth bringing the gear unless you're going for other gear lines. The only runout is through easy climbing.    Partner and I both enjoyed this line quite a bit, but I'm not really sure where the crux is. The roof is pretty easy once you find the hold above it. We both thought this was 5.8, and we're gumbies. Certainly don't feel intimidated by the grade, though it *might* be a good idea to stick clip the second bolt if you're a new leader. The moves right below it are thoughtful, and a fall would be...unpleasant.

    There are 8 bolts on this route, unless you clip some on adjacent routes.  Minor runout after B4 has ledge-fall potential and can be protected with a small cam (e.g. 0.3 - 0.5 BD).  More significant runout above B6 can be protected with micro cams on the left or medium cams under the overlap to the right (long draw).  Or just climb through it and wonder where those other bolts went.

    I did this first just running out the easy sections- did it again with gear, found a nice 0.3 C4 placement below the little roof and a 0.5 C4 in the easier climbing above it. It takes some of the fun out of it but sews it up nicely.
    Mar 7, 2012

    It also has something of a runout on 5.easy terrain (5.6?) that takes gear if you want it.  You can step left and clip a bolt on the route to the left up toward the top to make the runout shorter if you do not carry gear.

    Full Respect mentioned in the description is incorrect.    Respect was the original line.  After the undercling crack, climbing upright using the right hand bolts is the original Respect.

Full Respect climbs the first 5 bolts, 1-3 trad gear placements, then finishes on the same upright  bolted section of Respect past the undercling trad placement(s).  See other comment on Full Respect for details....    Variation:  Start in the dihedral (trad), to a bolt, traverse right and a trad gear placement.

    A few years ago, Mike and I went back. Clipping the 14 bolts, I led this climb, the top of which seemed different from what I remembered. The climb that Mike led in 1981 didn't have a #3 Friend placement at the top of the dihedral, as does this climb. As I brought Mike up, he noted that he had exited left in 1981 (on what is now known as "Icy Paralyser") where that line of bolts diverges from this one.     Yesterday, we climbed "Hydraulic Sandwich" and "Icy Paralyzer." We now firmly agree that "Icy" was MIke's lead in '81, when he placed maybe a couple/three wires and one or two Friends on the whole pitch. Only four sizes of rigid-stemmed Friends were available. A #1 Friend might have been placed after exiting from the main dihedral, to the left.     We thought our 1981 route was 5.10. That's one reason that I later assumed we had done "DtP"  it is rated 5.10.

    Steve -- No worries. I don't think first ascenders own the rock, anyway.     Every time I've driven up the canyon since we climbed it, I've reminisced about it. Now I'd like to clip those bolts (and the others on the rock). So leave 'em there.

    George, that must have been an impressive lead by Mike. I can imagine there was hardly any gear at all let alone any good gear. Since there was no record of your ascent on the rock or any guidebook as of 1996, we bolted it. If you guys are sure this is the same line (and I believe it probably is) and Mike wishes to see the bolts removed, I will gladly remove them.  We named it the Beer Can for the 30 year old Coors Cans we found wedged on the summit block. Peace, Steve S.

    One move of 5.9+ on the face to get started. Don't fall. The bottom was too wide for a #4 Camalot, but I think a #4.5 would have placed OK to protect this.

    I agree with Ivan's statement on clipping the bolt above the sloping ledge, it's commiting.  I'm 5'6" on a good day and had to use a 6" cheater to clip it after moving up a bit on the crimps. Without it, I would have had to do a really scary move to clip.  Other than that, a really fun climb.

    The roof is a fun "no feet" swing through. Why not use feet? Because you don't have to. Monkey-bar like holds don't need them.The crux is up above on the slab and face. Edging shoes or crimping dues, your choice.
    Oct 10, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Turning the roof is exciting, but not too hard. I did not unclip the bolt protecting the roof and instead used a long runner. But the first bolt above the roof caused the rope to run around a small corner, and that caused some serious drag later. So maybe unclip the bolt above the roof after clipping the bolt above that.    Clipping the bolt above the big sloping ledge was scary for me.  It's a long reach (and I'm tall), and you're a long way above the previous bolt. You have good edge for one hand, but you have to smear up with your feet to make the reach (or worse if you're short). If you blew the clip, you'd come flying over the roof and probably hit the wall below. If you're having trouble making this clip, you can traverse right on the sloping ledge and temporarily clip a bolt on Icy Paralyzer.

    The best of the 3 sport climbs on the wall, and a good route overall. I thought the moves through the roof were moderate 5.10 and a second 5.10 crux came up on thin face moves above. The picture below shows the good stem one can get by going high, clipping to the left, then stepping out to the branch off that this line takes from the 5.10 line. I found a really cool and fun rest there when, unable to stem due to a severe ankle injury, I layed back hard left with my body from the corner, crossed hands a few times and plopped my left palm down on the big bucket with my feet out to the right still horizontally even with my head. This felt like a "no hands" rest and was a stance sufficient to clip from.  Funny stuff you run into on rocks like this.

    I thought this was quite hard. Moving left to get established over the roof seemed much harder than the 5.9 that Ron says above. And you end up on an insecure stance. With difficulty,  I moved further left and around the arete to a big ledge for a rest. The crux for me was making the clip after moving left onto the lip of the roof, but I was a little spooked and rattled.

    This is a magnificent route that climbs the beautiful arete. I have worked the route the last two days and felt that there were two distinct and different cruxes, one about 3 or 4 bolts out and then another near the top.  There seem to be a million tick marks for feet all over the route with some fun, body tensiony heel hooking on the upper section. I copped a no-hands rest about halfway up by traversing 1 foot right at the ledge although the guidebook doesn't seem to consider this "on". Either way, it's a pumpy route and fairly consistent with the grade. As usual, you get the climbing grade controversy, I have heard that it's as low as 12b and as high as 13a. I have been climbing lots of mid to hard 12s in Rifle, Potrero, Shelf, Clear Creek, the New, etc. and feel that it's fairly consistent with the grade of 12c. Rate it what you want if it makes you feel better. Nonetheless, the route is stellar and props to the person who bolted the route! Make sure to check out Animal Magnetism close by.... I reckon that this is the best 5.11 in Boulder Canyon....

    Did the sharp left hand crimp next to the first crux-clip break?  It seems a lot smaller than I remember it, I hadn't been on this route for years.  Maybe it was the smarmy weather.  Still one of my top 5 favorite front range routes.  I think 13a if you don't do the no hands rest between cruxes, 12d if you camp out on the ledge; moves are as hard (but not as painful and crimpy) as HOD to the left.

I could get the left hand 2 finger hold, but then couldn't release the undercling...might try the other beta here and skip this crap 2 finger hold.

    This is a stellar route; Kudos to Fred and Dan for putting it together.    If you don't step around the corner to the right after the first crux to rest (which drops the difficulty), but instead stay to the left for a more taxing rest, then it is a comparable red point to Latest Rage at Smith Rock in Oregon, although more moves.  It is a notch harder than Easy Skankin in Rifle, but a notch easier than Pretty Hate Machine.  So, call it standard solid 5.12.  (Certainly, no-one will call it 12a.)  It would be a difficult route to onsight--very beta intensive.    Yes, you have to use lots of heel hooks, especially on the upper arête (I count four).  Using these heel hooks and slapping the arête_well, you are not going to get better pure arête climbing in the Front Range.      PS: Fred: where did the added bolt go in?

    12b?  I've heard this thing called a possible 13a (duck and run), not that I'd know.  Perhaps solid, very solid 12, possibly +.  On the first crux, it seemed best to go up with the left hand first to the sloping gaston, and then match before slapping for better holds.  Feet are terrible.  Not sure how you could do the upper section without heel hooks.

    Richard - Yes, it's a long reach with the right hand.
    May 1, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Joe - Thanks for another view. We had taken a look at the gaston and decided that the feet just got worse. The cross-through leaves your right foot well placed, but requires a great deal of flex in the hips, and it's powerful.  Frankly, I'd prefer it without the cross-through since that makes the move even more powerful. Next time we are up there I'll give the gaston a try. In similar situations, I've found the trickier footwork to be more successful than the more powerful solution.
    Oct 2, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    To jump in here, Richard... the beta I used for that section was to crank from the undercling straight up with the left to a well-ticked gaston edge.  My partner used a four-pad micro-crimp just below and to the left of this.  Then I would quickly slap the right hand onto the groper (the one you probably cross to).  This might not work if you don't have the ape index.  We both initially tried the cross-through to the groper, which went more staticly, but couldn't move up from that hold.      I could buy this as being a really hard Rifle-12b, but in B.C. or C.C.C this is solid 12c.
    Oct 2, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    We should all be so neglected.  You didn't comment on the beta yourself, Fred, but was the left hand cross-through the way you had sussed out the first crux? This move seemed really powerful, has so far always stalled me, and may not even work if you don't have the ape index.
    Oct 1, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Thanks, Richard...it's just that I was feeling so neglected....
    Oct 1, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Geee, Fred, how could we have let this slip by? For what it is worth, here is my impression. First, Animal Instinct is a killer line and truly worth the three stars posted here (That was the stroke). Second, it's tricky and powerful, but well worth the trouble to solve. Initially easy moves gain the base of the arete which is followed by  a few straight-forward moves to a powerful undercling off progressively worsening feet. Hunker up with the undercling in the right hand (sic!) and then make a very strenuous reach right with [left] hand to an initially sloping ledge. This move seemed hard. Once established right of the arete and on the ledge, a step around left puts you on the arete proper with holds coming from both sides. We found that a couple of heel hooks worked well for this sector. In fact, a heel hook seemed essential for the last clip on the arete. Move left at the top of the arete to another hard move on largely crisp edges. This is followed by a run up to the anchor on Sun Dog. Frankly, the final 5.9 run to the anchor seemed like a full blown crux in its own right, not difficult but spooky by the time you get here. Overall: great line, interesting and difficult moves, well protected but for the end, on excellent quality Boulder Canyon granite. (***)

    No one has commented on this fine route? If the grade and bolts aren't [controversial], I should say that I rated the route 12b, not 12c and feel that it should be a benchmark for that grade. Also, a bolt was added by a third party (I gave permission after getting tired discussing it).  I just don't want people think I'm another overbolter/overgrader. It's just that I try to use the standards of Eldorado Canyon, Rifle or American Fork.

    While I can see this route becoming vastly easier once you have the beta dialed, the lower crux is quite sequencey and the long sustained nature of the upper section can really wear you down if you don't do things just so.

    This is a great pitch.  My beta for the lower crux:  use the left Gaston to get the right hand in place.  Then lean to the right and do the high step to the hold between the 3rd and 4th bolts, but with the *left* foot.  Now stand using a laybacky move Gaston-cranking off the right hand.  This seems easier than the right-footed high step shown in the middle picture of the 2nd row.  Note:  if your belayer refuses to follow, cleaning is difficult.

    I agree with the above posters about the second crux and height (I'm sub 5'3). For me, the first crux (down low) was casual, but the second crux was harder because I had to use a slippery hold to reach the jug.

    This is one of my favorite pitches, trad or sport, in the whole canyon.  The section from after the second crux to the anchors is as good as it gets.  The fact that I can speak so highly of this pitch despite the fact that it has historically given me trouble is a testament to its quality.      Note on the rating: anyone below a certain height (185 cm??) will find AM's rating quite solid as the second crux will not involve a long reach to a great jug, but instead popping to the jug from a nubbin which is almost always wet.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'm short (5' 5") and found the upper crux considerably harder than the lower one. The lower crux is just balancy.    Warning: beta ahead.     Short person beta - for the lower crux - from the decent hold just below the 4th bolt, reach up and left and grab the large sidepull left of the bolt with both hands. Put your right foot on the hold where your hands just were (high step to the hold below the bolt). Then layback/highstep/rock up on to your right foot, reach up and get the finger pocket above the right bolt with your right hand. Next bump up to the jug just above the pocket.    For the upper crux - work your hands up the left sloping rail until your left hand is on the third decent hold - between the two large jugs lower down and the small crimper further up. Move your feet up to the two decent incut feet, then reach up with the right hand to a small, wet, slimy hold just below a large chalked jug. Hop your left foot up and go for the jug.

    David-  I guess to fine tune my point is: ratings from one side of a particular crag to another is a relavent debate, or one end of canyon to another.  However, to compare two different styles of climbing or two areas, i.e. Yosemite crack climbing versus Eldo slab climbing versus Rifle steep limestone, is comparing apples to oranges.   Eldo 5.11 does not equal Boulder Canyon 5.11 does not equal Yose 5.11  Grades are basically area and style-dependent.   One man's nightmare is another's daydream.  Just my opinion.

    K. Noisewater's post raises some thought provoking issues about the personal variability of the rating system.  In general, I agree with his relative rankings but:    Plan B is much easier for me than Tell Tale Heart, essentially the difference between onsight and total flail.    I'm far more likely  to fall at the 2nd crux of Animal Magnetism than at any point on The Edge.  My approximate lifetime batting averages on these two climbs:  AM .250, TNE .970.  For that matter, I like my chances less on AM than on any pitch of Astroman except for the hard (traditional) version of the boulder problem.    Have I crossed the border into full fledged moronism?

    11c sustained climbing, minus a subtle rest after the first crux.  May feel easier to folks with smaller hands, i.e. the undercling seam is a "jug" instead of a one knuckle crimp.  Ain't no way it's 11a :). Great climb all editorials aside. -KT

    BE CAREFUL on the lower out, especially if top-roping.  A 60 meter rope will not reach in the plumb line.  Because of the traversing nature of this route, the lead climber starts uphill on a high spot/pedestal, but lowers off to a different spot further down the hill.  If the belayer then stands at the downhill spot and belays a climber on TR, the rope WILL NOT REACH when the TR climber lowers straight back down to where the belayer is.  I watched a friend get lowered off the end of the rope here.      Tie a knot in the end of your rope! Always! And a stopper knot, not some weak-ass figure eight.  But you knew that.

    Is there, as they say, a grain of truth to Ken Trout's attempt at humor?  By skipping 2/3 of the bolts on this route I didn't change it for those who can only imagine bolts, but neither was it much harder than clipping the bolts.  It's just a rather disappointing experience given the potential for greatness. Before you list trad routes that haven't had bolts added to them you should ask Alan Nelson about the Bacher-Yerian.

    I've led this w/3bolts and I think with the right cam another could be skipped. The clean protection is so good near the top that an A1 medium stopper could be tossed into the crack from 10' away (the bolt is inches away). This would have been a great route. The added finish is suspect and is another story.

    I really enjoyed this route. It has a great variety of moves on it with a technical, fingery crux and then a long, pumpy, reachy section above. Good reach is an advantage on this route and seems to bring the grade on the upper section down a letter grade or so.

    No comment on grade; however, foot beta is important on this one. I found that cutting my feet at the lip and, with momentum, throwing my right foot on the obvious, large foot hold out right made this go down fairly easy.  Ignore those tiny ticked jibs.... Stick to the good feet.

    Interesting reading the comments after climbing this recently.  I'll chip in my .02:    Toe cam - I have no idea where you would use a toe cam to make it easier, it seemed like the holds were all facing the wrong way for this tactic(???).    Hard/easy...  my first go felt really hard, but it was pretty hot and humid, which isn't a good combo for this (or any) route.  After figuring it out, it was still not super easy.    Somebody calls it 11c, and their tick comments say 'onsight with a rest' or something like that. Not sure what to say about that.    Short versus tall, either should work ok.  Short would be better for heel hooking.  Tall can throw further, but it is more shouldery.  I missed ac's hidden crimp, maybe that would help. Another person had a good comment about paying attention to moving your leg around the rope.    My first go I didn't really enjoy it, but after I put it together, it was actually pretty fun.  Definitely worth doing if you are in the area.

    I'm 8ft. tall and this route felt like 5.9b. But, my girlfriend is only 3.6 inches tall and she said it felt like 5.17a so we split the difference and came up with 5.12a. Oh, and this is a good route too if you like that sort of thing.

    I'm short, so I went from the slopers and basically jumped to the good rail out right. Once I stuck that, I swung my right foot over and crossed my left hand into the rail and mantled up to the slab section. I thought it was a fun route overall.

    This route is temperature dependent.  Sent second go today, the middle of December. Comparing this to Empire of the Fenceless or Strange Science just across the canyon, I would say it sits in between.  In 60+ degrees, it would be hard. 11d?

    Probably soft, but I thought it was a ton of fun. The moves before the crux are big for me! My feet often cut going to the triangular jug, then some high steps and pinches get me to the crux, which felt a little more difficult than Days of Future Passed.

    This felt significantly easier than 5.12s on nearby walls.  I have recently had difficulty with Prince of Thieves 5.12a/b and Space Goats 5.11d.  I want to rate this 11b, but to reduce conflict, I'll say 5.11c. I'm 5'6.5" +3.

    This route is definitely similar to a gym climb. The crux is very difficult for shorter people. While you're on the sloper, the rope can get in the way of your foot maneuvering.

    Jug haul to V4 boulder problem. I found to best beta is high step left from the jug, left hand windmill to the low sloper/sidepull on the lip, right foot on good edge below jug, right hand backstep to postive part of the lip, match, left foot to jug, right foot flag, right hand gaston on rail then crimp it. Cut feet and swing right foot to low positive rail, shift your weight and fire to the good crimp.  5 moves. This route gave me a hard time the first time I was on it.

    Beta:  Stop reading if you don't want it.  Left foot on nubbin, right on a good edge to the right, hands on the chalked jug well beneath the roof.  High reach with LEFT hand to the left side of the sloping roof.  Right foot out left kickback style.  Right hand to a small crimpy sidepull out right below the roof (hard to see).  Grab it, adjust left hand to slopy crimp on roof.  Walk feet over to the right ending with the right foot on good sloper way out right. Then go for the slanting jug above the roof with your right hand.

    Difficult, one-move-wonder. Contrasted to Global Gorilla, it should earn a single star for the easy approach to the crux (5.9 or 5.10), single move crux perhaps two, a ledge rest before the last sequence, and a short route overall.     Slopey move to a deep slot. Gotta stick the sloper.

    Oh sure, ask me a year later... (snicker)I honestly recall it not being that hard for 5.12a- maybe the same as Empire of the Fenceless (?). Anyway, the toe hooks I am talking about were like side-pulls for the toes down below and kept my body at the right angles to be somewhat secure with the available hands.  No doubt, as this climb "wears in" over the years, it will get harder.
    May 29, 2003

    I agree with the comments above regarding this route.  I got so flustered, falling repeatedly off the crux, that I tried to aid it by stepping in a sling, albeit unsuccessfully.  I'm 6' tall with long arms so I don't think the problem is a reach issue.  The crux seems to be sorting out your sequence of slaps along the slopey crimps at the lip of the bulge.
    May 29, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Whoa.  The hardest 12a I've ever been on.  What toe hook are you talking about?  I'm only 5'8", but I would think I would've at least seen something for the feet.  I ended up just campusing through the slopers to the finger bucket at the end.  Nice to see some Boulder Canyon climbs with honest (sandbagged) grades.
    May 29, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I did not think that this one was too hard, but maybe it plays to my strengths.  It is a matter of just a few moves.  Shoulder strength and arm length may be crux for some people, but for me it was more the footwork that gave me the body position I needed.  5.12a seems reasonable, I guess for a local grade on sport. I've been on harder 5.11s and easier 5.12s.

    Without commenting too much further on the grade, I can say that at 5'10" there is a dividing line.  This climb [would] be significantly harder for short people than for tall people due to the [availability] to [toe-hook] the feet below the sloping rail.  I'm 5'10" and have relatively long arms and found that I could reach everything I needed without a real struggle, but with not more than an inch to spare.

    This route and Mosquito Burrito (Bowling Alley) have very similar position, although MB is more sustained, and the climbing is more intricate, for the grade.     I enjoyed this route, although I thought the bolt above the first ledge-break was placed too high. I am 6', and I had to stretch for it. A shorter climber would have to do a high-step move off the ledge, and a fall there would be a big one onto the slab below after you bounced off of the ledge.     A trick that I learned from setting gym routes was to never set holds above elbow height, with the arm raised above my head. That pretty much assured that a shorter person had an equal chance of reaching it from the same stance. Maybe some of these route developers should consider the same practice when placing bolts.    That bolt should be a foot lower, and then the route would be better, IMO.

We got lost on the way to Animal World and climbed an obscure bolted route which is on a crag about 100 yards due west of Animal World, with the base 50 vertical feet higher. It is a fun route, probably only 5.8 with about 7 bolts on it. It is just right of a gully, but I have no idea what crag it is on. There are some more bolts right of this line.

    Despite the route names or bolting issues, the bottom line is that this is a great route for any intermediate leader.

Simply an all around good climb and one many should put on their "tick" list.

    This climb has now been retro-bolted. Between the 4th and 5th bolts is a ledge. At 5 feet 4 inches tall, this was the crux for me, getting that 5th clip. I could not reach it from the ledge and had to make a move to get higher. A fall back to the 4th bolt would have been a good one.  If you fall while pulling up rope for the clip....  Diminutive folks may wish a nut or two to place for this move. Just a suggestion.     BTW, adding bolts to a climb does not generally give you the right to rename it....

    I gave this route a go yesterday. The gear was heads up until the pod at mid-height, but the climbing up to that point isnt too bad. The fractured hold in the crack didnt inspire confidence, however. The crack is just left of the arête  at the crux I reached around to the right instead of jamming the off-fingers crack and found enough of an edge to get through it. It would be harder if you stayed in the crack, but a little contrived in my opinion. Good route.

    About a month ago I put in a bolted anchor on this route and cleaned it, not knowing it had been done before.

    I found just having the draw hung was enough to make the clip reasonable. I also assume that the route setter was stick clipping the first bolt or putting in pro before attempting to hang the draw. I felt on the start if you stayed just right of the first two bolts it felt safe and pretty cool. My partner went left at second bolt, and it looked really unpleasant and not as safe. We didn't know it was a mixed climb and did the crack section to the last bolt with no pro, which is dead easy, but a fall would be brutal. As I was attempting to clip the last draw before the anchor, I stood up and hit my head on the roof almost blowing my feet and taking the fall. Thank God I didn't!!!! Bring The GEAR or be prepared to climb 5.6R crack, and watch your head before the clip. Yikes!!!    I'd give it THREE STARS for an adventure route. It gets sun late.

    Total POS.  Poorly bolted (can't clip first bolt from the good stance, even if you are really tall.  Ledgefall potential above 2nd bolt on weird bulgy slab, lame traverse into dirty crack (WTF???).    Total pile.  If it was bolted better, it would maybe be 1 star, but the moronic bolting totally kills it.

    There is good gear down and right of the first bolt although not obvious once you do the easy scrambling trying to reach the first bolt.  I would agree the first bolt is not well placed.  The movement on this route is good once you get into it, although it is a bit licheny since it appears to get little traffic.  I placed cams from tips to number 1 Camalot and a few nuts to supplement the bolts.  Worth doing if in the area and when it cleans up a bit more.

    You need to commit to the opening moves before you can reach the first bolt. If the first bolt was 6" or 12" lower this would be a much better route.

    A great pitch with a technical finger jam to undercling/ lieback crux that has shut down some pretty honed climbers. I first redpointed this climb in 2008 &amp; have repeated it almost every year since. It never feels easy. I always do it as a sport climb starting on Joint Venture for 6 bolts.  Below 7th bolt on Joint Venture, step left around the arete. Unless you clip this bolt, you are very run-out, but it's easy, &amp; there is a huge jug around the arete to pull up &amp; clip bolt at the start of the difficulties on Beast Food. If you do clip 7th bolt on JA, you'll have to clip out of it.    Ascending this left-leaning, flared groove begins with a good lieback hold. The crux is at 8th bolt. With a long Petzl draw on 9th bolt, you can clip it before executing the crux. It isn't over until you have the jugs above the anchor. The final moves above the last bolt are hard &amp; use a wide hand jam.    There are a total of 10 bolts /2 Fixe rings. There are 4 bolt (not 5) along the left-leaning groove that Beast Food ascends.

    From Global Gorilla if you go right , into the forest and follow the path of least resistance (there is no trail and some bush-whacking is needed) or follow the cliff up for an equally adventurous approach.  Find this route starting on the left wall of an overgrown gully with a nice rock for your belayer to sit on and a tree anchor.  You might want to bring a stick-clip or some gear to protect the move up to the first bolt.  The second pitch doesn't really require any gear but the bolt at the crux is difficult to clip if you are under six + feet  tall (I recommend a stiffy).  Also bring a wire brush and goggles.

    The crack in the corner, and everything to the right of the corner should be considered off.  Anything else disrespects the roof.      It's a great roof, albeit squeezed.  The first 2 or 3 bolts are the same as Joint Venture.  Then moving out right into the big roof,  there's some powerful shouldery moves, a long reach or jump to the matchable crimp out left, and some good knee tricknology to surmount the final roof section.  I'd like to add another bolt after standing up above the roof instead of climbing the rest of that arete to the upper anchor I'd make an (optional) midway anchor.  Felt something like 12+.

    The stemming is over after the traverse right. Once you step back left the business begins, but there are several Rifle-like moves that are less than obvious that make it pretty reasonable. Glad you like the route, Mike.

    Thanks Chris.  Good to know...thought I was losing a step.  Although, the next move after hugging the block seemed really hard too.  You don't continue to stem, right?  Great line.
    Jul 1, 2009

    It has been done without using the obvious stem.  12c/d.
    Jul 1, 2009

    Wait a tick, so the dihedral is "on" for stemming/rest below the roof crux?  Has the direct line, minus the stem been done?  Seems more direct and harder for sure.

    Gave this a go yesterday and loved it! Definitely a bit run out at the start, but it's not really hard. I brought a small nut rack and #0.4-#1 Camalots and found that sufficient; however, some small cams may be easier for the first placement, which was an awkward stance. The top half is way too cool. Loved the dynamic moves at the top. This climb made my day as well! .10c/d and probably easier if you are taller.

    I used cams #0.3-2 for the first section and they worked perfectly.  I was a little far off the ground when I got my first piece in, but it was easy climbing.  I think the "5.11 crux" was more like 10b/c.  Maybe it is height-dependent?  This was a very fun climb and kinda made my day.

    The prudent leader might bring a nut sack?!?    EASY, Robertson. Let's let the ladies have a go, too.    Fabulous fun climb for the grade, which I place at a couple letter grades below 11a, especially if'n you're tall and long armed. The punch all comes at the very end, with generous bolts and some THANK GOD holds on top.     Takes sequence, though--gotta hit the finish right. (No cheap beta; it's either left hand or right. You gotta 50/50 chance, sucka!)

    Don't be fooled by the featured start.  Be prepared to be a little run out on small gear heading up to the bolts.  The first piece of gear was well off the ground and I felt was strenuous to place.  Small cams are advisable.

    I thought this was a 10ish route.   Probably 10c or d even with the left crack.  A few balancy moves followed by some beat your chest ape moves.  The horn makes it just plain fun and the bolts are very well placed.  Kudos to the bolter.
    Aug 18, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    ALERT: If you climb Joint Venture first to the bolted anchor and then traverse back left to 'Cannabis Sportiva', there is a big, TV-sized, loose block about 6' left of the anchor sitting on a ledge. It looks like a great hand jam behind it to make the traverse but - DO NOT PULL ON IT!!  We would have thrown this to the ground, but were worried about it eventually rolling to the highway. It certainly needs to come off though.

    May 15, 2006

    The Rolofson guide says the last moves are 10b if you use the crack a few feet to the left or 11a if you don't. That may explain the difference in opinion as to the rating. It's pretty contrived NOT to use the crack on the left. Why not do it both ways? Climb the 10 crack, step back down, then climb it direct.

    Starting the route proper just barely to the right of the roof seemed balancy and tricky, especially right off the deck.  I'm sure you can walk up the gully further right.....enjoyable route with crack climber feel up high.  I'm surprised how many bolts there are.  The finger locks were bomber; felt like 10a at Eldo.

    The horn that Jon mentioned seemed very out-of-place on this route.  But I welcomed it with tired hands.  A really cool route.  The line more or less goes up the middle of the picture below.  The bolts start right about where the sun is shining.  Where the sun don't shine is the crack system.  A few smaller cams or stoppers would take care of this pretty easily.  Enjoy this climb it is one that about any intermediate climbe can do.
    Aug 30, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    It's possible to heel-hook the horn to get some additional leverage while trying to pull the burly .11a move;  Laura Black tried it on Saturday, 6/29/02, and it seemed to give her the extra bit of "oomph" weaklings like me need to pull harder moves.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable climb, made more enjoyable by the steadily-increasing difficulty.    It might be just me, but it appears to me that the left bolt at the top of this route could probably stand to be replaced.

    Was here today and climbed this thing, traversed in from the side as the roof gets wet with drip. Guy went up just before me and pulled the fixed pin out by hand, so NO MORE PIN on this thing, blue Mastercam or small nuts to supplement what it protected. Good climb, face didn't feel much harder than 10d to me but was heady on such "smaller" gear, fun for Animal World trad if you bring up a rack.

    Climbed the direct start last week by climbing around the easy way to clip the first bolt. It felt like a reachy V4 boulder problem and involved pulling on at least two blocks which may come out someday. The upper crack had interesting sections, but before the last bolt I used a hold that was covered in some black tar/poop and it felt like the rock quality was questionable. This route is worth it if you're feeling like placing some gear, but is probably the lowest quality route I've done at Animal World.

    Climbed it last year sometime.... I don't know about the opening roof, I tried it on TR afterwards, but skipped it on lead, climbing just around to the right. However, I didn't use any of Free Willy. Found Alien placements and such near the pin (which I didn't trust either). After moving past the pin and up, I managed to grab something that came off almost bowling-ball sized in my hand, and had to throw down, sending belayers scampering. Adventurous given the sporty nature of the area.

    The sketchy start just changed a lot; most of the starting roof recently collapsed.  I was there last Friday and it was fine, but I walk by the area today and there is a large pile of rock spread everywhere. Somewhat surprisingly, the first bolt is still intact, but the rock that stayed up in the affected area looks pretty sketchy.    Be careful hiking or climbing by this area!

    On a historical note, the first ascent team placed no pins or bolts and led the route on all natural gear.  (Good job lads!)  The route traversed in from the right climbed the crack past the current middle crux (at the pin and bolt) and then finished up and right in the chimney gully just left of Free Willie's anchors.Does anyone have any information about the direct start or finish?
    May 13, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If I could give this climb 1/2 a star, I would.  The best climbing on the pitch is the last ten feet.  Otherwise, I found it worthy to do only if you are somewhat desperate to do gear routes you haven't done yet, like me.      Dougald's beta about clipping the second bolt of Free Willie won't keep you from decking if you fall before getting gear in.  Even climbing the directissima won't keep you from decking if you fall before getting gear.  However, the gear is good when the opportunity first appears.  It gets more spicy after the pin and bolt.

    The dihedral crack turned out to be wider than anticipated and for most of the climb. I'd advise bringing at least 1 if not 2 #4s. Two #3s would have been handy as well.

    I thought this route was excellent. The first 3 bolts of this route are not the most classic or fun but goes rather quickly if you can use thin liebacks. The rest of the route is AMAZING. Even if you have to clip up, I would do it. I felt that the route was in the 12a range, because it had a ton of rests and was more technical than powerful. Easy top but a little balancy. Overall, a great route! Amazing climbing!!!
    May 26, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The slab climbing on this rig is highly unique. I found myself getting pumped out due to the continuous squeezing and sidepulling while using crappy feet. While the intial crux is certainly harder on a move by move basis, I felt unlocking the 40 ft of continuous slab with a final 12a section was the true crux for me.
    Oct 27, 2014

    Not 12a, but call it whatever you want. The first crux was a burly little section. Great route though with lots of varied climbing. I'm impressed. I overlooked this route every time I went to the upper tier but was surprised that it climbed as good as all the 4 star classics around it. Do it!
    May 9, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Maybe it was the specific day I was on this route, but I found it much harder than 12a compared to the other 12a's and 12b's in the area. Harder than Animal Riots Activist; harder than the second pitch of Global Gorilla, little harder than Piles of Trials, much harder than Days of Future Passed (which might not be 12a). Maybe I'll change my mind on the grade after a second go, but for now I sticking with harder than 12a, and a hard 12b.

    I thought this climb was very high quality.  The start is tough, thin, and the feet are tricky.  There was at least one 11+ section on the slab, unless I missed something.  This climb requires a lot of draws, 19 including two for the anchor.  A 70 M rope is helpful if you don't have someone to follow the route to clean the draws.

    Seemed hard for 12a in the opening. Good hands in the lay-away start, but marginal smears for the feet. After the fourth clip things settle down to thin, thoughtful climbing in a laboratory safe environment. The best feature is probably its length. A 60 meter cord just drops you back to the base.

    A cool variation to this pulls the 12a crux then traverses left into Animal Magnetism... I think the guide calls in Cujo Magnetism or something like that.  The crux is very technical and thin but didn't feel any harder than 12a to me.

    So I've redpointed Wet Dream, Animal Riots Activist, The Devil, and Strange Science. I still think all those routes were easier for me as they took me  between 2 and 5 tries, compared to ten on this. Been on constant Gardner, it feels harder than this, same with Joy Ride. It's probably not 12b, but I don't think it's 5.11 on the Boulder Canyon grading scale. Like I said, could just be a nemesis route for me, but I have a hard time taking 11b/c. Regardless of the grade, it's a great piece of stone with quality climbing the whole way.

    Train4Life, please tell me you were joking when you said, "this is a Yosemite move right here."  Debating whether a route is 5.11 or 12- is silly enough (is there really a difference?), but calling something a "Yosemite move" is just too good!
    Feb 22, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Jack Sparrow, I appreciate your comment, very respectable. I will respectfully disagree with your disagreement. I think you should try Animal Riots Activist and some solid 12a's like the ones I mentioned and see if this meets up with it. Try Tits Up at Shelf for a 12b comparison or The Constant Gardner or Joy Ride 12b for comparisons. I thought Empire was a bit soft for 12a, since it basically has one move even relatively close to 12a.
    Feb 21, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Hey Train4life, I will respectfully disagree with you. Could have been my personal experience with the climb, but the one move on this merits the 12a rating in my opinion. My beta involved a horrible left foot and a left hand cross to a small crystal crimp that you needed to lean in on to reach a good right hand. For me, when I compare this sequence to every other classic 12- in Boulder Canyon, it holds its grade. I'm comparing to routes like Empire of the Fenceless, Lucky Strikes, The Good The Bad and The Jacked, Prince of Thieves.   Maybe I'm missing something super obvious at the crux, not sure. This climb took me ten tries when I was consistently climbing 12 - on my second go. Maybe it's 5.11 but my complete, anti-style, nemesis route.
    Feb 17, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'm going to give my opinion, and I may come off as a MP mean man, but I'm just going to lay out what I think. I think this route is really in the 11b/c region. I think that Reefer Madness has a similar crux in Clear Creek. This may be a little harder because you have to figure it out, but it is not bad at all. I think the person that put 12+ onsight is a little off. This thing is totally onsight-able, and I have seen friends do that very easily. Try Animal Riots Activist right around the corner or Wet Dream at Wall of '90's or Hot Beach at Shelf if you want some comparisons for this to 12a's! I would even say that Strange Science (11d) and The Devil (11d), both at Avalon, are harder than this line! That's just my opinion...take it or leave it!
    Feb 9, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Likely easier for folks with bigger hands; I got a reasonable lock at the crux which made the moves easier than for those who have to hold a gaston. Either way, the business is so short, I'm not sure it earns the 12-.
    Mar 17, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Is the chalky rail system about 3-4 feet left of the bolts (and the crack just left of the bolt line) on, or are you only supposed to use the thin crack just next to the bolts?  I either really lucked out with the sequence or used a whole slew of holds that weren't on.
    Apr 14, 2012

    It feels really difficult until you figure out the move. Then its relatively easy. So like 12+ OS, 11+ RP.
    May 27, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I really enjoy this route.  There are some 5.10 moves getting to the crux.  The crux is sequency and challenging, and then there is a nice bold overhanging section to the anchors.    Super beta: the crux comes after clipping bolt 5, starting from the iron cross position.  The next placement of the right foot is key--don't put it on the good hold, but rather on a poorer hold right below.  Now cross the left foot through and put it on the good foothold, laybacking against the right hand.  Position the left hand high in the crack, get the right foot on the good edge up and to the right, and crank a Gaston with the left hand, standing high and reaching for the obvious chalked horn right of bolt 6.  Don't bother with any intermediates for the right hand--just go straight to the horn.

    Gear alert.  The fixed nut is missing.  As we had no gear besides quickdraws with us, and unwilling to commit without that bit of gear, we  traversed from the top of Free Willie, to the anchors on Days, hung the draws, including extended slings off the crux bolt.
    Apr 22, 2008

    The fixed nut is questionable.  Bring some small stoppers or a small cam to back this up if you are worried clipping the bolt at the crux.  I couldn't figure out how to transfer my weight onto the hold at the bolt at the crux move.  After that you are pretty much done.

    ER is a subvertical slab that climbs up to a no hands rest that is followed by a short, burly sequence to the corner of a roof, after which it calms down completely. One and one half stars is probably reasonable given the proximity of GG and Hands. However, I wouldn't call it a great route; I'd call it a good route.
    Jun 27, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    ER felt really burly in the roof. Stacking up under the roof leaves you with two, perhaps three at the most, hand transitions leading to the corner of the roof where terrific jug awaits. It seemed as though the hardest thing was to stabilize the barn-door when standing up under the roof. Can't ask for better pro - gives you a top rope through most of the crux. The run up to the anchors after turning the roof was on jugs. The opening 5.11 was more awkward than it looked to be from the ground; just thrutch through the corner. Two stars probably fits.

    This route is excellent!!  Stays dry in a downpour.  Long runner on the bolt before the roof to reduce drag.  My book suggests gear, but with 9 bolts, you dont need it.  Perfect stone.

    Super fun route. I went up and right and had a blast. Didn't feel easy that way necessarily, especially getting to the anchors. 5.12a.

    Both my partner and I thought that going right was easier, though more contrived and less logical. Fun route!
    Jun 28, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The funky moves staying left are pretty technical (cough cough, scummy kneebar) but what sells me on the idea that this is indeed a 5.12 is the vicsious pump you have by the end!  Good climb- start on Joint Venture, clip one of the anchor bolts, then continue, placing a cam or two in the corner, and up to the top.  A single 70M gets you down with rope to spare. I suspect a 60M will do as well, but have not confirmed.

    The crux getting into the slot on the 12b section is really strange! Felt like some sort of off width move, even though there wasn't any off width. hmm....    Also, I veered right into the old 5.7 for sufficiently easy ground to run out the distance between the bolts. The hand traverse from the old 5.7 dihedral out to the first bolt on Beast was exposed, but the jugs were huge!
    Sep 11, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The grading discrepancy is explained by the fact that the bolts on this route protect 2 different lines.  Climbing the groove left of the bolts is continuously difficult and hard 12a or 12b.  Climbing the blunt arete right of the bolts and angling back to the anchors also provides good climbing at 11+ or easy 12a.  Both variations are worth doing.
    Oct 27, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Rolofson's book also calls this 12b, and I agree. I don't know why it originally got labelled as 12a.
    Jun 25, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    In my opinion, this route is a sandbag at 5.12a and is probably more fairly rated at 12b. After a technical crux getting up into the slot the pitch stays strenuous including clipping the anchors.
    Jun 23, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Alternate description from redundant posting [Added by Ed.]    Beast Food is really just a short but excellent second pitch, or alternate finish, to either the Old Dihedral (5.7) or Joint Venture (5.11a).     So you can use either of these two routes to get to Beast Food.From the midpoint anchors on Joint Venture, you can step immediately left into the crack, which is not difficult and can be protected by a couple of #1-#2 friends OR you can go up Joint Venture and clip the next bolt after the midpoint anchors, and then step left and clip the first bolt on Beast Food. If you were to continue up the rightmost bolt line here rather than stepping left, it would take you to the upper anchors of Joint Venture.    After all that explanation, here is my recommendation: skip the gear and the old dihedral, and climb the excellent first half of Joint Venture, which has nice 11a moves for the first 4 bolts. Then climb up and clip the next bolt after the midpoint anchors, and step left on jugs to start Beast Food.     Beast Food burls up a continuously overhanging headwall for about 15-20 feet of strenuous sidepulls, past 4 bolts to anchors at 85 feet.The moves are difficult and the feet are generally bad and hard to find.When you finally break out of the sidepulls, just under the anchors, you feel like you are out of the woods. However, you soon find that the holds are a little slopey and there are bad feet, so even the very last move before you clip the anchors is a bit tenuous.     Lots of fun and great stone! This thing would be 3 stars if it were longer. Linking it with the first half of Joint Venture makes for a long and reasonably continuous line.     Stays sunny until the afternoon.

    This climb is awesome with a very cool, bouldery crux. Beta alert: for the crux sequence, everyone I've seen climb this does a very big throw to a lieback pinch that is very bad until you position correctly. I've never been able to do this move that way. I hit the good, sloped, right hand crimp left hand on sloper. I then bump left hand to a hidden crimp undercling, right hand goes to a flat sidepull. Then I bring my left foot way high to a hellhook just under left hand. I then statically cross left hand to a crimp sidepull in the seam then switch your heel to a toe hook (this is the crux for me). Then move left hand to lieback pinch release toe hook and throw to the jug. For me, this route is solid 12c. I have a hard time even taking the slash grade, because the crux alone is V5 either way you do it. Also, don't underestimate the upper crack, it's just tricky enough to spit you off. Awesome climb, should get done more.

    I was actually quite impressed with this route. I have always overlooked it given that 2 mega classics sit just to the right of this line. The crux is a bit weird and scrunched, and there is super fun pumpy 5.11 climbing after it. You don't need gear getting to the first clip. It's super chill, just climb with caution through the rotten rock. All in all, a decent route and one you should get on one day if you have done all of the other routes on the wall.

    In Sven Speak: this route is very tough for the fingers; I did not make flash. You must arrive to the fourth bolt at five meters with a preparation for crimping. It can be helpful also to prepare a long sling or double draw already on this bolt to facilitate clipping. Above here, you will find many meters of fun and pumping 6c (5.11) that is not so tough for the fingers after all.

    Though it appears this route still sees few ascents, it has cleaned up quite nicely based on previous comments.  The crux sequence is low on the route, making it feel more like a V4 boulder problem to a 5.11.  Still, there are plenty of interesting, heads-up sequences throughout the pitch making for a truly worthy line.  5 stars!

    Not sure I'd call it one of the best routes at the crag, however, it is worth a go. In its current state, it is rather unpleasant due to seemingly zero cleaning.  Look out below or risk an endless showering of dirt, lichen, crumblies, and guano.....

    I wouldn't call the rock quality on the lower section through the crux excellent.  Maybe after a few dozen ascents it could be ok; for now it's quite flakey and dirty-- a far cry from that on 'Hands' and the rest of the popular routes at upper Animal World.

    Very fun route. The crux for me was clipping the last bolt, and then that mantel was so awkward for me. I tried the "beached whale move", but that mantel is too small to make any progress upwards. I eventually fell and then started from directly below the last bolt and made the final move up to the last hold before the anchors. I thought it was going to be a crimp, but it was an OMG jug.

    I disagree that this is nicely protected. Not an issue for me, but I'd imagine someone breaking into 11s this could get super heady.

    Kevin,  When I first TRed the line before placing the bolts, I did the "beached whale" move when the feet cut loose on the traverse. Hence the name.

    I've always been confused as to why this is called "Free Willie".  The movie to which the name refers was called "Free Willy", so am I missing some pun or euphemism besides the "beached whale" allusion?  A minor quibble, I know.  I've never used the block marked 'X'; is the route easier that way?  Avoiding it and using the traverse isn't that hard but seems harder than 10.  The difficult part about the traverse is that the feet are fairly nonexistent and you have to commit to the ledge and cut your feet loose.  This is the best part of the route and this is the point during which the famed ECB--Euro Chalk Blow--should be executed.  For those not familiar with the maneuver: after cutting the feet loose, hang casually with one arm, radiating insousiance, reach back and chalk up, grabbing a fistful of chalk, then blow through your fist to create a chalk cloud.  At this point, for best effect, a photographer, preferably situated at the anchors of an adjacent climb, should snap a shot in pure 80's style.  Wearing spandex improves the effect.

    A 4 stars and very fun route with an exquisite mantle just before the top anchors.  Awesome!

    RE: Free Willie and the crux bolt:    As of May 15, 2005, the hanger at the crux traverse, just under the platform before the anchor, is spinning on the bolt. The bolt looks as if it has wiggled out of the rock a bit. There's a narrow quicklink there now where it looks like somebody bailed out before the anchor.     I fell off the platform moves and the hanger held, but this bolt/hangar should [probably] be replaced.     Also: the infamous flake at this crux has been reinforced with epoxy (had time to look while gritting my teeth avoiding it). After the fall I gave the thing a test pull or two and it seems to be pretty solid. Still, better safe than sorry and there's a couple different ways to get up the thing, so might as well avoid it. Just my two cents.     Thanks.

    I managed to not have to mantel at all. Look up above the shelf thing and reach for a good, postive hold about 4 feet up, sort of on a mini arete.     One of the best routes I've been on in the canyon, simply because of the steepness and bountiful positive holds.

    Last time I did this route the block with the X held my 200 lbs. Going from the block then up right to the jug Tony mentions above, you do not have to mantle or belly flop (both of which I tried on my non-onsight).  Pretty easy if you trust the block (or the bolts).  You can rest in the mungy stuff off left before the crux ending, or stay to the right and make it more direct.  Pretty cool way to air out yer ass for sure.

    The anchor shuts on Free Willie are beginning to show signs of serious wear. I didn't have any quicklinks with me today -- but two are definitely needed before summer.    PS. There's a new bolted route around the arete about 30' left of Free Willie and 20' right of Jaycene's Dance. It starts up the slightly overhanging left wall of a block-capped, left-facing corner. .9+ (?) past the first two bolts, .9- to the fourth bolt, .7 or so up the slab above (with a 25'-30' runout between the eighth and ninth bolts; small to mid-sized gear optional). 9 bolts total; 80'-90'. Judging by Rolofson's guidebook, the route is a few feet to the right of Familiar Strangers (unless Familiar Strangers has been retrobolted with a new start).  [Eds. This is Unfamiliar Strangers.]

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I do the same thing, Tony.  Further to the right, there is a better right foot; making the high step/heel hook  with the left foot easier, and keeps you from stepping over the rope. The jug you speak of is good, and makes the move more elegant than the 'knee step-whale mantle'.

    The mantle up top is easy to the right. I did this yesterday &amp; saw the Xs on the block, so I skipped it and went further right, to the edge of the upper face, just below and to the right of the final anchors. To my surprise, and I mantled up there was a huge, brown, UNCHALKED jug to the right, which made the move somewhat trival if you have the armspan to reach it. I suspect this route derives its name from the "beached whale" move that people do rather than mantle. It's pretty funny to watch, and bound to happen to shorter climbers more often.  As for the height-dependency, my 5'4" partner did it, but had to use funkier footwork at the reach to get it, but not dyno at all- look at the slopes be the cracs (sic) to the left and for a good black "eyebrow" sized positive edge just below. This adds a crux to the route, I am sure.

    The rock below the first bolt is crumbly and breaks unexpectedly.  I know because I broke off a substantial foothold and fell ten feet to the ground and then another fifteen feet into the talus.

    As of Saturday (7.20.02) someone chalked two "X" marks on the blocky hold that facilitates the mantle to the left (see previous comment).

Either that or work the mantle up and right to the anchors avoiding the block entirely.

    As first ascentionist of this route (and the first to guidebook it), I find it pretty bizarre to see it described as a 3 pitch climb. We never attempted this route in multi-pitch fashion, only as one long pitch. In fact, if you were to belay atop pitch 1, it would create a point of aid to rest. I can't imagine falling off with your belayer right below you to crash into. I describe each stage as lower (.11b), middle (12c) &amp; upper (.12b/c).     I established the middle stage in 1996 &amp; originally called it 12b. Later I realized it was much harder (.12c) than other .12b sport climbs in the canyon including ones at this crag. There is no way in hell you can call Kudjo Tranquillizer &amp; Global Gorilla (middle) the same grade.    Later in 1996, Rick Leitner bolted the upper stage. I added the last bolt on our first attempt. It wasn't until 1997, I redpointed the entire climb.   You can lower from the climb's top back to the end of the middle (pitch 2) at  the shared anchor with Animal Magnetism. Then lower to the ground with a 70 meter rope.   It also bothers me how some people who submit climbs to the website can't be bothered to give the date or year the climb was established.

    An 80m rope came up about 15 ft. short when linking all 3 pitches.  It can be done with a little down-climbing. After cleaning all draws and lowering off of the anchor, it was just about long enough.  80m 9.4 rope.

    Wow!  The first pitch alone on this climb is one of the best 11s in the canyon, but linking all 3 pitches into a 160' pitch makes it absolutely amazing.  I just wanted to post a current comment that says that the "3rd pitch" seemed completely solid to me.  Don't be afraid of loose flakes, I didn't find any.  I also have to agree that the "3rd pitch" is the crux of the climb.  Even with a great rest before it, the moves feel way harder than the "2nd pitch crux".  I realize it's all relative, but I would call it 11b, 12b, 12c.  Every "pitch" of this climb is 2-3 stars, but, as a whole, it is unquestionably 3 stars!

    I got on the 3rd pitch of this the other day, and I would have to say that it is considerably more difficult than the supposed route crux on the 2nd pitch.  However, there is a fairly sizeable scar between the 1st and 2nd bolts which may have once been a fairly crucial hold.  The pitch was also unchalked, licheny, and somewhat flakey making me wonder how many ascents its seen.  Watch out below if someone is on this pitch: I dislodged a credit card sized flake which nearly hit a party below.  Compared to the other pitches at Upper Animal World, I would give this pitch 1 star for the climbing and 3 stars for position.  I would rate the three pitches of Global Gorilla 11b, 12a/b, and 12c.

    Clarification: in the photos I just posted, when I say "crux", I'm talking about doing just the first pitch as an 11b climb.
    Dec 15, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    For the problem of falling on your belayer, it's best to do the first two pitches as one. Expect huge rope drag on the 2nd pitch though. We got around this by TR'ing the first pitch, then launched into the 2nd pitch with the belayer still on the ground.
    Jun 1, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    P2 seems a bit contrived -- a lot easier  (12b) if you head hard right above the belay - staying left is 12c and you risk falling on top of your belayer. P3 is quality. Seems the vast majority do P1 and rap....
    May 27, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I did the second pitch of this recently and really didn't think it was any part of 12c.  I would say 12b, 2 stars.  The first pitch, however, is my favorite mid-11 sport pitch in the Canyon, fully 3 stars.
    May 27, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Only led the first pitch, but the description is right...wonderful pitch with different types of moves all the way up.  From the left side of the arete, clip the bolt before committing to the move out onto the arete.  A sunny day, good friends and climbing like this are what it's all about.

    No need for double 60s to get down. As it is mentioned above, there are three bolt/chain anchors on the way up over a 160' piece of rock. One could do it with a single 50m, and do three raps off. With a single 60m, you can link from the ground to the top, then thread the chains and lower to the cushy second belay ledge (all the while your second is still on the ground). Then you can either belay them up, or just pull your rope and rap (two raps to ground) and give them a go on lead.

    I soloed this route yesterday and did not find hardly any loose blocks on it at all. Near the top there was a breadloaf-sized loose block that was sitting on a ledge that was easily avoidable. I didn't throw it off, because I was afraid it'd go to the road. There was some blocks that looked loose at the very top, but I tested all the ones I used thoroughly as I was soloing, and none of them moved. Also doing the route in late fall/early winter was good, because all the plants lost their leaves and were easier to navigate around. Overall I liked the route.

    Got about 1/2 of the way up this route last Sunday and ended up downclimbing because of all the loose blocks. There are more than a few toaster-sized blocks that will be easily knocked loose if pulled on or used as a foot-hold.    It would be irresponsible to do this route if there are other parties on the ground. Make sure your belayer is attentive and has a helmet on.

    I agree that this climb is of poor quality. Before bolts (June 19, 1980, to be exact), I led Cathy Mallow up this dihedral/gully. (Does this put me in the pantheon containing the likes of the Stettners, Ellingwood, or Ormes?) I didn't report our ascent because someone could have climbed it before we did, and I didn't report anything in those days. Instead, I kept a journal and occasionally took photos.

    This route has given me great satisfaction for the hangdog. To prepare, I made hangdog ascents of many other Boulder Canyon 5.12s: Tell Tale Heart, Vasodilator, and Buddha Belly, but Hands of Destiny gave me the most satisfaction, because it allowed me to send the crux before providing the desired hangdog.    But seriously, awesome route. What's the deal with the fixed copperheads on this route? There is one right at the crux with a broken cable and sharp frayed ends sticking out just above one of the crux holds. I guess they are being left for historical purposes?

    This climb is rad! Tried it a year ago and could never figure out the crux despite sending many other climbs of higher difficulty. Just returned and figured out the crux sequence in a few minutes. Pretty thin and devious face climbing with a techy crux. My advice to everyone is to do this climb when it's cloudy and cold. This wall bakes in the sun all day and is extremely hard to do when it's greasy. The crux won't even feel possible if it's hot, perhaps why I could never send it in the past. Great route, though! Don't cheat yourself by stepping out right and clipping the chains of Animal Instinct like some people do. The climb ain't over til the fat lady sings! The slab up top demands your attention. Do it and smile the whole way, the face climbing on this route is some of the best I have been on. Brilliant!
    Nov 10, 2012

    Great position, solid rock, and varied movement with technical and mental cruxes.  Don't cut yourself short by traversing right to the Animal Instinct chains, it's not over!  Some rope work would need to be done to manage the rope drag if trying to link all the way to the top but you get pretty good value after finishing P1.  Classic Boulder Canyon sport climbing!

    Onsight and hanging the draws it felt closer to 12d to me (I can't really climb slabs anymore - too much time in the gym - so I had to try a little).  Though not very hard, it's sort of challenging to put the puzzle together onsight.  The final slab is desperate: no chalk, licheny, and I had to use my feet - thought I might blow it there! A little scary getting to the 1st bolt too...good route for BoCan.

    Hands of Destiny was rated 13 a/b in Rossiter's Boulder Climbs North.  He lists the gear then as small stoppers, TCUs plus four pins.  Just maybe it felt a little harder placing gear than it does now with all them safety clips.
    May 3, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I think the Rolofson rating of "12c/d" is about right on.  The "c/d" for the height dependent nature of several moves in the crux section.  Don't think you have this climb in the bag if you get through the lower section... the top seam/slab is tricky and hard.
    Mar 17, 2004

    Great line, but I'm amazed that three different guidebook authors grade it so dramatically different. Hate to say it, but this is much closer to 12c than 13a.

    I agree with Fred Knapp.  There is no way this route is 13a.  No move is harder than 12c, and it's not at all sustained.  It is a very good route though.
    Oct 13, 2003

    Hands of Destiny is still intact, perhaps the broken hold above the third bolt is on the new route to the left of Hands of Destiny.  This new route is still "shedding".
    Jul 2, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Maybe I really suck, but I think a hold has been broken.  I was up there recently and it was really hard to clip the third bolt.  Anyone got any info?  I could see a scar where a longish hold might have been to the right of the third bolt.  The only hold there is now is a pinch above the bolt.
    Dec 1, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Here is some additional info that some may find useful (regarding the route) that has nothing to do with Sven.    A 60m (200ft) rope will allow one to lower off or rappel off the 1st pitch anchors.  A 50m rope won't make it to the ground.  However, it would be possible to lower/rap to the anchors of Animal Instinct on the right and rap off those rings with a 50m cord.    The first bolt is about 25 ft off the ground.  One can protect the easy 5.8 loose block intro without additional rope drag with a cam  (1.5-2 Friend) and a long (1.5 shoulder length) sling.  Although this is not necessary, I prefer to minimize the risks when possible.    After the blocky start, this route is very well bolted with easy clips.  There is also some additional fixed gear that is helpful when working the moves or just hanging the draws.  Hands of Destiny is excellent, with great 5.11 climbing, despite the crimp fest crux.

    Bob D"Antonio makes an important point here and one that came up for me while climbing in California during the last three weeks. We ran into a visiting gang of hardcore Brits who were very much aware of climbingboulder.com and spent some time contrasting it with the web site 8a.nu. What I took away from their comments was the degree to which what we write here becomes visible throughout the world. In other words our comments have become very public. For that reason, I would suggest that if you write it here comments and route descriptions should contain information and ideas that you are willing to have placed in the public view. Think twice before adding spray, sniping, and vituperative dissing of other climbers.
    Oct 17, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Dear Sven, I think what American climbers got annoyed with is the selective nature of routes that you profiled, which all appeared to be flashes. Perhaps if you had added routes which you had more trouble on or were able to supply more helpful information than "quite fine bolting" or "short crux", people would not take offense. It's not that American climbers hate climbing, they hate what is called "spray," the gratuitous offering of info designed to make the sprayer look good. Describing a route has nothing to do with whether you flashed it and that news is of no help to someone who wants to know about the climb. It has nothing to do with where "there is more enjoyment of the climbing sport" but a lot to do with perceived attitudes and how you clearly wanted to talk only about flashed routes. I for one would be more impressed with descriptions of harder routes which require larger commitments of time and energy to succeed on. All that said, flashing Rainbow Wall is impressive. Best wishes, A. Coward

    The comment next to last was not my own. Perhaps it has been unwise to share my experience on this site. Many of the climbers in the US are very hostile to other climbers (not just myself!). Soon I am to return to my job in Bergen where I teach skiing, and I will remember my good experiences climbing in Boulder. I think it is sad that so many climbers in the US do not so much enjoy the climbing as they enjoy feeling good to be better than other climbers. In Europe, where we have very many good climbers, there is more enjoyment of the climbing sport so this has been a big surprise for me in US. Perhaps more of my US friends will learn to take pleasure in the climbing sport, then everyone will feel welcome here.

    So to be for the flashing most ready, climb if you can the 4 routes of the most similarity. And on the route not falling the moves is best. So for Vogue flash I do 4 14a flash after 4 13d flash redpoints!
    Oct 15, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This plan is nothing. It just how my friends in Bergen and I train for the flash. For many years we feel that the flash is the best way to show that we are improved in climbing. For us to flash this takes a plan and a strategy that we call 4-plan because it is based on 4 routes taken 4 times. For illustration I can use Hands of Destiny. We pick this route to be the goal for the flash because it is a quite nice route. We train by climbing 4 routes of nearly the same level and on the same type of climbing rocks. These are not tried to flash but only to red point. When 4 are done we try the flash route where the goal is now to flash. If we do this 4 times then we go to the next higher level. If we fail in the flash then it is necessary to try again on a new choice. We feel that if we must change the climbing rocks, then it is likely to need to begin the 4-plan from the start. All of this is only so that we may focus the training and not to drift too much from the goal to improve. Some of my climbing partners can make the red point at the 5.14 grade but this needs many tries and many failures and we think that to flash is maybe a improved way to measure our success. In the last week after a long trip to Utah and to Rifle in Colorado we came back to Boulder for another training but I think many climbers in US do not want to hear this.

    I see my American colleagues are fast to anger. Perhaps you should not have so much anger for my success as you should ask how much I must fail to reach my goal!

So please do not take the offense for my success, I have had to climb so many routes for each one.

    This route, The Hands of Destiny, has given me a great satisfaction for the flash. We spent one week climbing in Boulder Canyon in order to prepare for this climb. Hands of Destiny was to be a good target for the preparation because it is of very good design. One can approach the difficult section with not very hard moves and so be rested before starting this part. After only 3 meters the difficulty comes again to only 5.11 (6c+) and does not again become more difficult. Our preparation allowed us to try many good climbs in Boulder Canyon, and many of these were very excellent routes. For my climbing, I feel that Hands of Destiny was the most special route of all. Our 4-plan was good, our preparation was well, The Hands of Destiny was a very excellent and nice climbing route.

    Very good route, deserves more than 2 stars.  Below the first bolt and coming out of the upper corner are the cruxes, IMHO.  It is easy to be led astray by chalked "sucker" holds in that corner (which happened to me).

    This route is pretty cool IMHO. I'm surprised to see it on here as 10a though, given that the BoCan guidebook by D'antonio calls it 9+, and I'd agree with that. I started up the crack and thought it was fun. Definitely a little tricky in spots, but I wouldn't say the climbing is 10a. Kind of creepy on lead (especially because from the 5th or so bolt, you can't see the next bolt), but if you trust your technique, you should be solid. Creepiest part is coming out onto the face near the anchors, but the hands and feet are all there. I'd recommend doing it if you're in the area.

    Climbed it today and loved it!  The route does look kind of funky from the ground. It has cleaned up very nicely. Clip the first bolt and move out left to the arete. IMHO the crux comes after the very long reach (I'm 5'9") to clip the 5th bolt. The thin finger holds push me to give it 10a. The moves out left at the top are spacey and cool. Looks like a harder variation going straight up and over the corner. Thanks, Greg.

    If you read the first comment (done 1 month after the first ascent), Paul climbed the corner "though a bush, dirt, and loose rock wasn't all that inspiring". When this route was first done in Feb. 2008, the crack was full of water and ice, hence we bolted the clean dry rock on the left. We came back in April and cleaned the corner to produce the trad route "We Don't Do Crack". The moves following the bolts left are technically more difficult. You can climb the route any way you want.

    Seems awfully contrived (and wrongheaded) to move OUT of the dihedral/crack at the first bolt, just to rejoin it ten feet later before sending the upper sections. Leave it to Boulder....    At any rate, as of summer, 2011, the crack start seemed clean 'n' friendly enough. And my six-foot frame was easily able to clip all bolts without having to use any gear.

    Hey I was just asking originally so I could post the photo of the start for everyone...found the description a bit vague and it isn't in any guidebook yet.  I wanted to make sure if I was commenting at all I was on the correct route in the database.  I was asking for the sake of the next person looking at the site for a nice moderate to climb at Animal World.     IMHO, I'd say this route has two starts...one up a dirty crack...and one a somewhat contrived (but perhaps fun nonetheless) up a face past two bolts to avoid the dirty crack.  They both end up at the third bolt.  The natural line is up the crack, but since you have bolts to protect the moves out left people can try that also.  There is no "wrong way" upwards.    The crack start would also be fun cleaned up a bit.
    Mar 21, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Wrong way??? Well someone forgot to put tape on the holds, so I had to be inventive.    I think you could climb either the face or crack as they are only a few feet apart at the start. Though if you climb the crack you'll want to protect it with gear - the bolts are too far out left to be that useful for protection (until the third bolt).    The crack seemed pretty obvious to me and doing it that way felt 5.9+ overall.  Perhaps just 5.9 once the lichen wears away. I didn't do the bolted face start so can't comment on its grade.    Still some loose rock on this one, so keep your belayer aware.
    Mar 20, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Does this route start on a black face, at a dihedral that could be lead on gear?   I placed cams past the first two bolts - though a bush, dirt, and loose rock wasn't all that inspiring (I'm not posting some anti-bolt tirade just clarifying location).  The upper section was pretty lichen covered, but with more traffic would be a nice addition to the crag - since there aren't many mid range climbs here.

    If you have a 60m follow the above advice, but tie knots in the rope to be sure.  You can't reach the big dead pine ledge with a 60 at all.  We tied stopper knots in our 60m rope and the climber just untied 10' up and downclimbed a bit, so we could hang out at the big dead pine ledge.      Awesome climbing.

    Did this route today, lots of fun. The new BC guidebook, and this page for that matter, say you need a 70 meter rope and 14 draws. Neither are true. Once you are on the upper ledge, climb another 10 feet to belay at the base of the climb (great belay seat). You can easily skip the first bolt, then it's only 11 draws to second set of anchors which are about 90 feet from the ground. Highly recommended, needs more traffic to help it finish cleaning up a bit.

    Pretty fun.  The place where the block came off was obvious, and the climbing into the overhang has changed, but it isn't any harder.  Yes, the "stump" that is left is semi-detatched and probably will come off too someday after fatigue and freeze/thaw cycles.

    I only did the first pitch of this route, and found it to be sustained 5.10d.  The second pitch we did not do because Maciej pulled off a large chalky block, just by barely touching it.  He lowered from the first bolt after the first belay.  There was definitely more loose stuff up there.  Normal spring climbing stuff, there is a good chance this route has changed a bit with the block that Maciej pulled down.

    Done as a single pitch, this will become the best mid-range 5.11 sport route in Boulder Canyon once the lichen on the upper headwall cleans up a bit.  Great position and thought-provoking movement.  Out of curiosity, I used the advanced search features of MP to list all the 5.11 sport routes in Boulder Canyon sorted by stars. Nothing on that list is better than this climb.  Animal Magnetism probably has a better finale, but over the entire length this route delivers better moves.    Of the 3 separate roof tiers, I think the 1st is hardest and the 3rd is the easiest.  The upper headwall looks so blank from the ground, but it has a surprising rail on it that makes the upper headwall moves some of the easier moves on the route.    Use a long runner on the 1st bolt, the midway anchor and the first bolt after that and your rope will run nice and straight.    Great find Bob, Vaino, Greg and Dan!  Thanks for the effort too.
    Jul 11, 2008

    Thanks Bob D, Vaino and Greg.  This route is awesome, one of the best at Animal World. 11c, maybe d, I will go with 11+.  It still has a bit of lichen on the upper section but will clean up quickly.
    Jun 2, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The first pitch is tricky and sustained from the 3rd bolt to the anchors -- maybe .10c but it felt more like .10d to me. The wild second pitch is probably .11c onsight (easier once you've worked out the beta). Another excellent addition to Boulder Canyon.    As Chris said, there's a nasty 20"x20" death block to the right of the first bolt on the second pitch. Although it looks like a good stemming foothold, it's completely detached from the wall. Be careful.    A 70m rope isn't mandatory but makes it easy to lower to the dead tree instead of downclimbing from the ledge at the start of the climb.    PS. In light of Bob D's comment, I deleted my remark about Dana's .10c rating. Sorry about that.

    Maybe I was having a rough day, but this route caught me ofFguard.     I think I missed a clutch hold or something, 'cause I had to so some high-brow fandangaling on nail-y stubs to get up the bottom section.     I hope next time I climb it, I'll have a "a-ha!" moment followed by a face-palm.

    We pulled a tiny post-thaw flake off just above the second bolt, but it didn't seem to impact the climb.    From above the first bolt to the area just left and under the roof, this climb requires balance and technique more than it requires strength or crimping.    Don't be scared off by the consensus grade. If you climb in the 10s regularly, you'll be able to do this climb.

    A bit inconsistent, but good times, nonetheless. I didn't find the supposed 5.10 moves around the cruxes, but the 11a move down low and the one up top are each just one-move wonders.    One thing: I don't understand climbing just the first "pitch," which is only about as tall as Dennis Rodman. Unless you have an old-school, 37ft rope, you should probably think about taking the WHOLE line, young leader. The second "pitch" is wholly different, but just as good, with a little spice if'n you don't have monkey arms. And the overhanging top out jug fest is about as fun a finish as you can ask for.     And forget the cams--you don't need them for the cruxes. While JV may not be littered with bolts like the rest of Boulder Canyon, it still protects plenty well where you need it with the clips at hand.

    The second pitch if staying in the crack is pretty stout. I believe it is said to be 5.12.    It felt pretty darn hard. You can easily finish the route or choose to just climb the arete skipping this crack. Sure is fun climbing though. Really fun as one long pitch no matter how you finish it.

    ALERT:  If you climb this to the bolted anchor and then climb 'Cannabis Sportiva', there is a big, TV-sized, loose block about 6' left of the anchor sitting on a ledge.  It looks like a great hand jam behind it to make the traverse but - DO NOT PULL ON IT!!  We would have thrown this to the ground, but were worried about it eventually rolling to the highway.  It certainly needs to come off though.

    This route can be climbed as an easy 5.10 or maybe an 5.11a, depending upon the line taken. On the upper section, where it follows the arete it is also possible to set right into the dihedral there (still within clipping reach) and stem/palm to the right to pass the crux on the arete.

    I seem forever to be in the role of guide book writer.  If I go to Manhattan, people stop me and ask  how to get to the Trade Towers.  As for Joint Venture, the name is a play on Cannabis Sportiva, and on the fact that I did this originally with Leah Macaluso.  Leah, being rather short, hated the upper arete.  She was my massage therapist as well as a lovely climbing partner.  Dan Hare had nothing to do with this route.  Leah and I started in the narrow dihedral in the left of the photo via gear, then climbed the arete to the right of Dan''s route.  Do you people read guides books or just make this stuff up?  Dan's route climbs the steep face just right of the initial arete then takes the upper dihedral just left of the upper arete of Joint Venture.  Dan's route is called Feeding the Beast and is rated overall, 12a.  The name may be a reference to Dan's insatiable lust for setting new routes.

    This is a great climb, but the fledgling (flailing?) 5.11 leader might want to bring at least one mid size nut or a #3 or 4 Metolius size for the run from bolts 6 to 7 (counting clipping the lower anchor as a 'bolt'). I found it a little much for my taste, as the climbing got harder there, and the reach was a bit much for my 5'6" self.  Otherwise a great route with fun moves below and again up higher.

    This route is pretty dirty right now.  The tricky crux at the third bolt may get easier after a few laps and will certainly become more enjoyable.

    The one move at the third bolt is overhung and makes this route harder than the one left of it, so I would put this at 10a. Stay on the small holds right instead of using that white, chalked-up jive hold up and left.

    This route (as originally done) follows the wide crack straight up.  The bolts left are Nice To Be Here (done as an easier start) which joins Lovely To See You higher up.

    If you take a bit of falls or hangs at the roof, where the crux is, pay attention to your draw.  When you hang, if the gate is facing left, it will likely open the biner for you.

    I think this is a good route, and while it may not be 5.11 for the duration, the top section still ticks in at 5.10c/d.  I think the first bolt is way too high off the ground, so consider a stick clip.  The problem is that the while the first bolt is just out of reach of clipping from the ground, the fall from this ledge would likely send you to the hospital.  Would the FA agree to the addition of a bolt lower down to avoid this possibility?

    I thought that the first clip was a little high to get a draw on from a good stance.

    Funny that nobody mentions that the first bolt is a bit high off the ground and the climbing to it is nontrivial.  If you don't want to blow it and tumble another 50' down to the base of Global Gorilla, I recommend (much to my dismay) that one consider stick clipping the first bolt.  The route is a good alternative to Global Gorilla if somebody is on it.  Be careful if you blow it clipping the anchors; potential ankle sprain geometry.  What were those guys thinking?  This is Boulder Canyon after all.

    Great route, and the grade seems accurate to me.  I thought the climb had an accumulation factor, i.e. the various cruxes began to take an accumulative toll on my forearms and psyche.  Even though you could take a nap on the mantle ledge, psyching up for the  crimp/small  foothold traverse to the anchors takes some effort, particularly if you arrive at that point with an onsight happening.

    I have racked my brain for a suitable cold cut joke, but must settle for just agreeing with Ken. The clip seemed like the hardest move to me, and it is certainly very contrived not to end the route at the stance to which Bill refers.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Ken's full of bologna! You can rest as long as you want before making the crimp moves over to the anchor and clipping. It is certainly a difficult clip, but not the crux of the climb. I found the crux to be reaching the mantle hold (where I fell off) or the mantle move itself (almost fell off).    Fun climb. The hard move at the bottom is by the first bolt, I think. It is indeed a very cool stemming problem. There is also a neat liebacking section by the fourth or fifth bolt. Lots of good variety on this pitch.
    Aug 1, 2002

    I would say clipping the anchors is the crux of the climb.  I popped off while pulling up rope here and went for a fun (and clean) ride.  This climb is easier than Global Gorilla's 1st pitch despite the harder rating.  If you're looking for a warm-up on Upper Animal World (as opposed to doing something on Lower AW and then walking over), this is a good one since the hard climbing starts up high and after a couple of no-hands rests.  The hard move at the 2nd bolt is really a stemming problem so it shouldn't tweak your fingers if they're not warmed up yet.

    Sorry to contradict, but I felt that the 12b right variation was way contrived, traversing away from the obvious line and that the 12c dyno was the natural way to go.

    I did this the other day via the 12b way, and I have to say that this version is nowhere near as indirect as Rolofson's guide states.  All the holds you use to skip the 12c section are within 2-3 feet to the right of the 4th bolt.  I agree that going way right to the rest is pretty indirect, but firing straight up the bulge (the 12c way), dynoing to the jug and skipping all the good holds just to the right, is very contrived.  Good route though.

    I really liked this route -- the ledge after the traverse makes it too tempting to rest/shake out before pulling through the crux to the upper arete.

    There is a very definite crux at the third bolt (of pitch 2) that seemed like it would go two ways. A huge body length dyno up and right to an angled rail or classic BoCan crystal crimping up and left. I only managed the latter, but the dyno would be spectacular. Either way it's pretty mean and punchy. Good stone, but it looked as if the second pitch doesn't see much action these days.     It's also worth noting that pitch 1 shares anchors and the last four bolts with Cujo Tranquilizer to the left.

    The first pitch of this route is rated 11b and is a fun route in that grade. Unfortunately, the crux comes right off the ground and involves a pretty intense crimp and a high step. A bit brutal for a warm-up. The rest of the pitch is easier, but continuous and fun. Clipping the bolts on the upper section is a bit awkward because the bolts are on one side of the arete, but the climbing is on the other.

    Great, thuggy climbing through the roof. The two buttonheads don't inspire much  confidence (though they're probably ok) before starting in on the crux. The best link-up might be to head up Isn't Life Strange, clip the P1 anchors with a long sling, then head into the cool roof. The climbing before the buttonheads is fun, techy, slab climbing that is worth doing at least once, however.

    Excellent addition to the crag! Yes, it might share a hold or two with ILS, but for most part it is an independent line with classic movement. It has a little bit of everything - thin technical slabbing, thuggy roof climbing, and a slopey finishing crux. Well done!
    Nov 14, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I am not trying to be a hater here, but this route is more or less a contrived, squeeze job - at least the bottom half.  Not stepping over onto ILS takes almost as much effort as the 5.12 moves themselves! The upper section is pretty cool, although there too you kind of have to force yourself not to bail onto the neighboring 10a to the left. Seems like it could have been done as a variation finish to one of the neighboring routes rather than adding a whole new line of bolts. Just sayin'.

    I was on this route once or twice a couple years ago but didn't have any real recollection of it today.  So, technically it wasn't an onsight, but practically it was.  As such, it would be my first 12 onsight according to MP consensus standards.  Super hard, slabby moves including some micro edges, technical feet, traversing, arete moves including an arete bump, etc.  AWESOME!!!  The first real crux comes when exiting the ledge and traversing left onto micros, feet and hands.  Going to the anchors, immediately following the 2nd crux, you gotta keep it together mentally, because you finish by going to the left after the final clip.
    May 18, 2014

    The first crux at bolt 5 is thin but all there.  After clipping bolt 5, throw to the arete on the left, lower but better than the slopers above.  The second crux at bolt 7 may be the more difficult.  The last bit to the anchors is a bit tense, because you're off to the left and above a bulge.

    To me this root felt every bit of 5.12. The bottom crux alone, unless I am missing some beta, brought it up to this grade for me. Add the top crux, even with the good rest, and I think that this deserves to be an Animal World 12. Make sure that the sun isn't too hot when you go for the redpoint. Like Animal Instinct, sweaty hands and slimy, hot rock will kill you on this route.

    The large block is still sitting precariously on a small ledge next to the anchor. This gave me quite a fright when I setting up my rappel. I barely touched it, and it started to fall down. I caught it and tried to set it back in a stable position.  I'm surprised it's still there after 6 years or so. I'm not sure if further action should be taken to remove the rock, but people should at least be aware of it (it wasn't mentioned in the guidebook we had).    Otherwise the route was pretty fun. Did it in one pitch with a 70 m. We belayed from the boulder, but I was able to rappel down to the base of upper Animal World.

    Climbs better as one pitch.  A 70m will get you from the rap rings at the top of p1 down past the tree to a dirty ramp closer to the ground trail, so you can avoid much of the class four downclimb if you want.  Just be careful not to put the rope over anything sharp and to not get it tangled in the tree limbs when you pull it.  Thanks for those bolts, fellas.      Nice and long climb with fantastic views and fun movement.

    Hmmm, I guess I'm the odd one out here. I didn't think this route was very good, mainly because I found it quite chossy. A lot of key holds on the route are not fully attached or are hollow.

    The large loose block right of the anchor is still there, stacked on another loose block. Trundling does not seem like an option regardless of whether there are climbers below as it could easily take the ride to the road.

    There is a large loose block just waiting to fall about 2 feet down and right of the anchor...it moves to the touch, but it is too big to lower down with a person carrying it.  Trundling is not an option when people are below, like there was today... and who knows, it may hit the highway when it does go.  Be very careful up there, and when you pull your rope, the thing is dangerous.

    A good climb, mostly owing to its length. There are still some loose rocks but they are pretty obvious- remember there could be people below and be cautious.  Also some suspicious holds (caution, eh?) and including an odd crux hold (flake/pinch/gaston) on the 2nd pitch, probably where Ron mentions the crux in a tight corner.  I doubt it will be there forever.  Climb on a 70m to return to the starting ledge by the dead tree with no worries.

    Bob and Greg,  On the behalf of the climbing community, THANKS.  One of the nicest blend of continuity, just enough run out and length.  One of the best 5.10 in Boulder Canyon.  Will do that route again.  It's sooooo good!    An alternative to the 60 m being too short to belay from the ground:  Belay the follower from the second belay top anchor, it's comfy enough.  Bonus:  A stunning view across the canyon!  Two rappels will bring you back safely on the ground.    Beta:  Stay left for the crux move, otherwise it's a dead end/way harder.
    May 12, 2008

    This is a great climb! One of the best 5.10 sport routes I've done in Boulder Canyon. Interesting, exposed, and sustained. I felt the crux (a funky corner just above the mid-way anchor) was about 10c, and may be harder for shorter climbers.    You can get to the starting ledge for this climb in several ways:    1. Climb Laurel &amp; Hardy Meet Abbott &amp; Costello (9+, bolts) and continue past the two-bolt anchor to a big dead pine tree on a ledge about 70' up.    2. Walk right beneath Laurel &amp; Hardy... for several hundred feet, and find a path cutting back up left to the ledge with the big dead tree.    You can belay by this tree (it is solid enough to be used as an anchor), or scramble up loose ground for 25' to a higher ledge just below the first bolt on the route.    From the higher ledge, it is about 100' to the top anchor. You can lower or rappel with a 60m rope.  From the lower ledge with the dead tree, it is about 125' to the top anchor.  You would need a 70m rope to lower to here, but be careful if you try this.

    This should become a Boulder Canyon classic -- lovely position and climbing. The crux corner on the second pitch is tougher than .10b for 5'3" and shorter climbers (my wife was grumbling "sandbag," ".10d," etc. as she reached the anchors).

    Good route Bob.  A really nice addition to the canyon in the 5.10 range.  We did the whole route (12 bolts) with a 60 meter rope but belayed about 10 feet below the first bolt.  A 60 meter rope easily makes it from there but as always be careful.  Tie a knot in the end of your rope if there is any doubt in your mind.

    Thought this was actually a really nice line, but it definitely felt quite a bit harder than its 12- neighbor (which feels more like .11). I'd give this .12a. Managed to tear off a chalky but pretty useless hold under the roof at the 1st bolt. Non-intuitive moves through the first roof are hard but fun and very different, it feels like tufa climbing at times. The finger locks at the second roof crux are outstanding, and the arete/heel hook exit is great.    **Everyone please do your best to not climb any higher on the sketchy bolted in flake piece than the finger locks.

    Jesus Cristo Bob!  I applaud your hard work as I have done the same.  I drilled two 10 inch deep holes and glued two threaded rods into them.  I then camouflaged the holes with sand.  The rock was a little hollow and since the bolt and hanger that keeps you off the ledge needed to be in that section of rock  I figured I would just make sure it was bomb proof.  What a pain in the butt.  Some routes as well as those who trust that our bolt placements are in solid rock deserve the extra effort to make them safe.

    Terry Murphy and I toproped and scrubbed this route a couple of years ago but never bolted it cos we couldn't figure out how to remove the offending flake. Granted it's fine just using the fingerlock at the bottom, but as Dave said the flake kinda leads you on. I did shove a block off about 5 foot from the bottom of the route and then watched in horror as it accelerated down the slope, jumped the fence and barreled across the highway about 15 seconds before a car drove by. Ughhh. Nighttime trundling seemed like the best option to remove the flake safely, but we never managed to get it together.

    Thanks Bob for bolting this.  It is a decent route, and after doing it a second time I like it even more.  I placed 2 Xs with chalk on the flake up high.  Please be VERY careful with this flake and use it for nothing more than a low finger lock.  From this lock, you can bust out right to good face holds.  If this thing goes, it could make it to the road.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Done with the direct start this is the best of the new routes, and pretty good over all for where and what it is. The 3 star rating assigned is accounting for what I believe it will be like once it cleans up a little more. At present, some of the small chips for feet were still grinding down and I snapped a good bit off of one of them. It actually got bigger now. With a little more srcaping and brushing, it will be a good route.    The flake up high sure seems like a death flake to me. I was scared to go any higher then the finger-locks down low once I looked up at it. It looked like a good hard pull from the top or a solid whack with a sledge hammer would probably dislodge the whole thing, but it might go all the way to the road and kill someone... there or on the way down.    I hope it won't, but my recent experinece at A.W. on the new routes has been less than stellar. I pulled a 200lb flake off of the 11 and several holds off of the 12 to the right.

    We did a start directly below the arete, rather than coming in from Days of Future Passed. Is this a new variation? The first bolt however was missing a hanger, but a nut cable can be used on the stud and yellow and red Aliens can back this up also until you reach over the roof and clip the 2nd bolt.  Pretty good climbing overall and the direct start adds some more 5.11 down low.
    May 1, 2008

    This route is very good. together with the two routes to its left, you have a great little chunk of climbing in a concentrated area. However, be warned that this and many of other routes at the upper Animal World crag have a lot of loose / chossy rock. Most of this climb is clean, but a large, angular flake and a loafy jug up top look to be possible missile material. Knock on flakes and jugs before you weight them, and try not to yard out on anything that isn't bombtruck. I guess. Anyway, like I said, sweet route.

So, to me, it was at least 5.10c, if not slightly harder, if you stayed more to the right of the bolt line.

    How do you rate it?  Well, the climb is a step off of a 5.7 much of the way, and I could force the line right for hard moves (probably 5.11) or stem back and left for rest (far easier).  By staying more or less on route as I could figure it and choosing the most interesting yet solid climbing up without getting silly eliminating holds and stems, the grade I checked in at was probably 5.9.

    While climbing on this last week, we had an unfortunate occurrence on this rock.

My feet were on it and I was reaching for the sidepull when all of a sudden CRACK,two pieces of rock flew out, nearly killing my innocent belayer.      Needless to say, its a bit harder start now, probably in the 12a/b range, so while aI agree with the previous grade of 11a as a whole, that bouldery start has some more burl in it.

    We climbed this on Thursday - thanks for knocking the big stuff off. There's a lot of sand on it, and a fair bit of loose rock still.

    This is 5.9 PG or PG-13 without trad gear. If the person who bolted this route thought to themselves "Hmm..I'll leave this open for gear placement", then it should not be on Mtn Prjct as a "sport route." As a 5.12 leader, I felt great on it without gear! It was a fun climb!, but most 5.9 leaders will not feel comfortable with this route and should be notified that it is either NOT A SPORT ROUTE, or PG / PG-13.    It is tiresome to hear opinions that the route should be left 'as is' when it's not described correctly, and some very traditional climbers LOVE their easy run-out terrain for no apparent reason. We all know rock breaks, especially with freeze thaw.

    Fun climbing, but substantially easier after the second or third bolt.  This is not the only route I've seen bolted this way. Remission in South Saint Vrain has similar runout, but like this climb, it is over very easy terrain for the grade. There are probably some places to place gear, but I feel it adds to the excitement of the climb. There are bolts where they are likely to be needed - It's just a different bolting philosophy.    As of this post, all bolts and anchors are in good shape. Lowering hooks can be found at the top. Placement of anchors can make setting up a rap tricky if you don't have long enough slings/PAS.

    Bring a #0.75 and a #1 to protect the runout if you're worried about 25' of unprotected 5.4 climbing. I'd give this three stars if it was more sustained - it get tremendously easier after the 2nd or 3rd bolt.

    Not a bad route. Did it while I was waiting for a party to get off of Animation to the left. First moves are the crux. To protect yourself a tad, you can climb up on to the big ass rock right at the base and clip the first bolt, then downclimb and start up left. After maybe the 3rd bolt or so, it's a jug haul. Fun, but a little scary on a really windy day... even though the holds are all super positive, the bolts are faaaar apart... if by some chance you take a fall, it's gonna be a big one. Worth doing once, I'd say, but probably won't go back to it.

    Wonderful bouldery start to jug haul/easy climbing.  Genuinely enjoyed the runout as the section is very easy and no place for natural protection (granted we had a very calm evening session).  It lets you realize your exposure and how high you are in the canyon, adding a bolt would take away from this route (runout is not harder than 5.7).  Stay focused and appreciate your zen.

    First two bolts are the crux, most of climbing above there is much easier. I think the route is fairly well bolted, a bit of a space higher up but on some very easy moves.

    Fun route. Crux is def getting past the 1st &amp; 2nd bolt. Fun, easy climbing up top w/enough run out to keep you on your toes.

    I used a green Alien somewhere around/between the 5th or 6th bolts and a black Alien between the 8th &amp; 9th ("The Runout") bolts for good measure.  The moves around the first few bolts are the hardest part and I enjoyed the rest of it.  I did however stand on the boulder to the right and clip the 1st bolt, then started from the ground...a fall off those first moves could be ugly!

    Phil,  Rope stretch and the amount of slack out by the belayer (some climbers prefer a loose belay) could make a top-roped groundfall a possibility if the climber fell down low.    The best solution should obviously be to have the belayer keep a snug-to-tight belay for the first 5-10 feet or so, until rope stretch will definitely not be an issue.

    Caught my buddy on a fall off the beginning of this route last year.  Well, I should say the bush caught him. It was pretty fun but even on TR there's a big potential for ground fall.  Just make sure you got someone spotting you in the beginning of this one.

    Just imagine you're climbing at the Flatirons and the runout shouldn't bother you too much.  The holds are all there and positive.  Fun route!  If you like, the route would go mixed with an assortment of thin to hand sized cams.

    The bottom is tricky, but anyone can figure it out pretty fast (you are on the ground). The 30 foot run out is pretty intimidating at first, but whoever bolted the route figured, if you can lead up to it, you should definitely be able to climb a 5.6 to the next bolt, although I'm not sure why a bolt wasn't placed. Does anyone know?
    Jun 18, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The first move was easily done by standing on the flake and stepping up with your right foot on the big ramp.  The lead was a bit scary since there was a bit of potential for groundfall on the first move.  The rest was so pointlessly easy that I don't even think this route is worth doing.  I rated it one 5.8 move with a lot of 4th class afterwards to my partners.    All the bolts seemed well placed, and the runout didn't bother me.  Too bad the anchor wasn't placed a little higher so the last overhang could be part of the climb.

    Does anybody know what the name of this Dan Hare (?) route is?    Also: perhaps this discussion is (long?) dead, but I'd add another vote for *not* adding more bolts.    I appreciate Peter Beal's perspective (the D'Antonio-esque access-for-all ideology, which is great if that's how you want to put up routes), but I tend to agree with the personal responsibility argument.    "rant" Pro opportunities are a fundamental part of *every* climb, sport or no. Suss things out for yourself, make decisions for yourself using the resources available to you (cb.com is major advantage over what we had even a few years ago in this respect...if you wade thru all the garbage), and climb it or don't. The FA party creates a line (and by "line" I mean the rock/pro combo): assess whether or not this line suits what you're up for climbing, and take responsibility for your own choice. If the FA party added enough bolts to make you comfortable, then great. If not, then this line isn't for you...luckily, there are about 10 thousand other lines within an hour to chose from! Finally, if you can't determine whether or not a line is for you with the resources at your disposal (e.g. eyes, brains, internet, friends, etc.) ... well, that's probably a good message that you might be better off moving to something else."/rant"    Old fashioned, and Anon by choice...

    Greg, I'll give you that one. It does seem a little strange to a bolt so close to anchors after a long run out. My comment about pointless was more directed to the first comment on the site, and that just in general I don't mind when you run it out a bit on a significantly easier section of a climb. But I am also very much for safety and if people think this route lulls unsuspecting climbers into a false sense of security then maybe it needs looking into.

    Thanks everybody  for all the reminders that climbing is dangerous. However the bottom of this route  is anything but dangerous, while the top is "spicy", climber-talk for don't fall or else. For a naturally protected climb, this makes sense; that's the way Mother Nature intended it. For a rap-bolted moderate, it seems silly.  This route could probably be lead all on clean gear, a little "spicy" in sections but no really big deal, difficulty-wise. That makes more sense to me than the current arbitrary  set-up now in place, one that  is bound to result in some kind of  accident, sooner or later.  Luring someone onto a route with closely spaced bolts down low and runouts up higher is irresponsible. Make it clear from the beginning what the route is like.
    Nov 1, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    So what are the ethics of adding length and bolts to protect said length to an existing climb?  Seems to me it would be the same as adding a "second pitch" and if the climb were a sport climb, it wouldn't change the existing climbing or the nature of the route, it would just add an additional length to it. For my own part, if I had not sent a line to the top of something and someone wanted to add bolts to it to lengthen it, if it already had bolts, then I wouldn't have any question about it at all.  Is there an ethic or standard regarding this that I am unaware of?  Or could someone (in this case Greg) feel comfortable and beyond ethical qualms in adding another bolt and 15' of climbing to a different set of anchors and call it a hard extension?
    Nov 1, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Gary, I never said the runout was "pointless". I said the anchors were located in a pointless spot. You do the runout and stand on a ledge and clip a bolt. Then you climb about another 5 feet of nothing difficult and then clip the anchors above your head on an overhanging wall. The climbing from the ledge to the anchors adds nothing to the climb other than make a 50 meter rope not to reach the ground.  I would like to have seen it extended another 15 feet above the current anchors to add another crux and have a second set of anchors at the ledge to facilitate getting to the ground.
    Nov 1, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I found this route to be a good deal of fun. For me the opening sequence was quite tricky, even for 5.9 and from then on quite easy. In MHO the run-out is not "pointless" (thought it did catch me by surprise) because it adds some spice to an easy section of climbing.
    Oct 30, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I wouldn't be upset if a bolt was added by whoever put up the route.  The runout, in my opinion, is only about 5.6-5.7, and it seems unlikely to me if you can lead the 5.9 crux you would fall on a 5.6.  I can think of 10 other sport climbs I have found more terrifying due to large gaps between bolts.

    Peter,    I certainly would not object to another bolt in the runout area. This is not Jules Verne we are talking about. I am not sure why people who object to bolts even climb at Animal World.  It is a moderately enjoyable route and I think Dan should extend it another 20 feet.The anchors are in a rather pointless location.
    Oct 26, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Clearly outlines the difference between the way a sport climber approaches a route and the way a trad climber would. A lot of routes bolted on lead are runout because the first ascentionist only placed a bolt where he could get a stance and where he deemed it necessary. There are a lot of bolted routes that are traditionally bolted and therefore runout on easier ground or where the FA couldn't get a stance or an aid placement no matter how meager. Solid Gold in J-tree comes to mind; Figures on a Landscape, too. The way it is bolted can sometimes full affect the character of a route. Even when a route is bolted one should read the route for runouts, difficulty of climbing near the runout, etc. Thinking for oneself and not assuming the first ascentionist cared about me or my safety is an important part of being a safe and competent climber. No matter how hard you pull.
    Oct 26, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Peter, climbing is inhenrently dangerous and unpredictable.    If you start the route without trad gear and then notice the run out (like I did) you have two choices: run it out (as you and I did) or get lowered and you lose a biner.    Otherwise we would need to bolt all the run outs in the Flatirons, too....    At least now, if one reads the description on this site, you know there is a scary run out and that you may need gear.

    My point is that  a climber can look at this route at the bottom, think, OK this is safe, then find out, quite a bit higher, that a 20-25 foot runout is mandatory.  The next step is go for it or climb back down. Why bother putting in the bolts in the first place?
    Oct 26, 2004

    I'm in favor of leaving the route as is.  If someone is uncomfortable with the route in its current state, then don't climb it.  And, as someone mentioned, there are gear options.

    I did this last weekend and would like to suggest that it be retrobolted. The bolts are very close down low and then very far apart up high. The gear you can place is OK but  not  located  in line with the bolts (bring double ropes?) and the last bolt is barely three feet below the anchor. If the equipper could identify him or herself and explain why the route was put up this way, that would be helpful. Otherwise the route should be fixed, before somebody gets hurt on it.
    Oct 25, 2004

    The opening moves of this sucker are tricky to figure out, it seemed to us the easiest way is not really where the bolt is.  You can stand on a flake to clip the bolt, but then you have to somehow go back left, maybe even retreating to the ground and starting farther left.  From the flake, we traversed and then cranked straight up; this would be a pretty scary sequence without the bolt protecting you ...    The runout up high was indeed noticed!  It does seem odd when there are 3 bolts in like 10' and then a significant gap, then one more and another 4' higher are the anchors.

    This route is bizarre in that trad climbing sort of way. There are some well-protected moves upon entering the corner, good stems, and tricky gear going out the roof. Body English if you're short, a long reach to a good lock if you're tall. I'll echo Tony B's gear rec. x2 in the 0.3-0.5 Camalot range, some C3s or equivalent, small stoppers and maybe a #1 Camalot. Good, funky, unique route for this grade in Boulder Canyon.

    A great climb with some crums near the bottom, but great rock the rest of the way.    You can traverse in from the right, past the starting flake on 'Talking Out Of Turn and establish a belay on a few stoppers at the base of this climb.    Carry a rack of nuts, a run of small cams (to 0.75") and a 2-2.5" cam. The crux is getting the feet over the lip on a rounded finger-lock above a good nut (maybe a #5 BD stopper or equiv?) For people with small fingers like mine, the top is not difficult at all, but still needs pro. Doubles in thin fingers cam-size (first-second knuckle) will be useful if you like lots of gear, but are not required.    If this thing continued another 50', it would be a 4-star classic. Sadly, it is a short line.

    I lead this last night with Seth Musulin and would have called the route 5.8 at the most and R/X (no option on the pulldown tab for R/X). It was chossy but the holds were big enough that it wasn't that big of a deal other than the death pillar 25ft up (first and only place you get gear). Unfortunately 6 other people were below so I did not cut the pillar loose so beware. I'd be careful toproping this line as well as there are a TON of loose rocks above, especially if you use the tree anchor. Also, the route is only 30ft tall, but the tree is back another 20+feet from the top, so the height in the description is technically accurate, but don't expect that amount of climbing. Seth and I also added two new routes to the left side of the crag - a 5.8 crack and a 5.10b R face thing.

    Really fun moves through the roof and over the lip -- more solid than I expected.  I had the advantage of my partner having placed all the gear at the crux already as we sorted this thing out, so I got to cruise right through.  Some of the stances seemed a little pumpy to place pro from.  I'll definitely be back to clean this up.    I highly recommend the stopper at the lip (#12 BD).  It didn't really get in the way of my hand jam over the lip, and the crack is a real rope-eater and quite sharp.

    Equally guilty.... I lead the pitch and hadn't read the description of why the stopper was there. I'd commented that I'd have preferred a fingerlock to the handjam I got and that may have influenced Jason's cleaning of the gear - no harm intended.  It was a pretty good line, but could still use a nice brushing up above the roof to make the feet a little more solid. Right now with the amount of dirt and moss the mental crux is trusting the friction... which means less enjoyment of the climbing in and of itself. But it should clean up very nicely.

    I was actually pleasantly surprised by how much better this route climbed than it appeared from the ground. Still a bit dirty, but quite a fun roof actually. I removed the fixed stopper above the roof quite easily if whoever left it wants it back.     EDIT:  Sorry, just read your description for the first time and saw the comment in the gear section about you leaving the nut because of the rope. Sorry for removing it, though I don't think a fixed piece there is necessary. Maybe just a comment in the description saying it's a good idea to put a nut here to avoid problems with the rope? You'd probably want a piece there anyway but I found that large of a nut kind of hindered my ability to get a good jam. Nonetheless, if you want it back so you can replace it, I'd be happy to return it.

    Firing directly straight up the bolt line makes it somewhere between 5.11-/11. It's pretty fun climbing, but it's completely contrived (everyone else apparently thinks so too, given that there was zero chalk on almost all of the holds, but plastered everywhere else) and poorly bolted on top of that. The crux, if following the contrived line, really isn't even the climbing - it's not getting accidentally sucked into the heavily chalked, easier line out right that felt like part of the adjacent route. Following that line seemed no harder than 10d.    It's actually pretty fun movement through the lower section - only thing saving this route from a solid bomb, zero stars, would not recommend.

I guess to make it .11c you can take the contrived way straight up, but isn't every route harder if you avoid all the good features? Never-the-less, put all that out of your head and just venture up some nice face climbing, no matter which was you choose to do it.

    Another Rossiter route with a clipping crux (or two).  I guess those types of things happen when you are furiously grid bolting as fast as you can.  The actual climbing is good, but the location of the 2nd bolt, and to some extent the 3rd bolt, detract from the route quality.

    This climb is reasonably fun, but the fun is dampened by the close proximity of the lines left and right, which produced an unpleasant  "I-wonder-if-these-holds-are-on" mental debate.

    2 things: first of all this climb felt harder than 11a. I went right of the first two bolts and maybe should have gone left?? Also, be careful on the second clip.

    I've climbed and established a fair amount of routes with Bob. He is prolific and puts up fun routes, although he is not big on doing a lot of cleaning. I've done several of his routes and found easier sequences which were only revealed after either brushing the pitches up or feeling around in the lichen for easier sequences.    I'm not a fan of rating routes on contrived sequences when easier ones are within reach, not that I think that's Bob's intention.

    Straight through the roof is heinous and harder than most Bocan 13as. Maybe a hold broke?

    Shumin, I tried this thing today and had the same question about the roof. My initial instinct was to go above it on the right, then traverse back left but looking at the bolting job, decided that wasn't the intention and so I reversed it back to below the roof. From here, I punched it straight over the roof, with the first roof bolt a bit to my right. Felt really hard this way with awkward holds and powerful reaches/lockoffs. Not sure this was the intended path though....

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Got on this route a couple of weekends ago. It doesn't seem like it has seem much traffic lately.   Question for the FA, is one suppose to "bypass" the lower roof by going to the right and then traverse over on the lip? I tried different things to go over the roof directly, but the holds were thin and the moves burly. The eventual sequence I settled on (and for the upper crux) involved delicate balance rather than brawn.  Fun route detracted from the creek and road noise.

    I climbed it today, didn't have a guidebook with me, just a few notes from mountain project. I wanted to do some easy routes, so I though this was a 5.9, and I climbed the whole thing thinking: "this is a hard 5.9". The finger crack have to be quick to get to the bolt and clip, I didn't get pumped. It's a nice technical route, mainly legs, but below the roof, it took me some time to figure out. I did chimney using the rock on the right, it was easy when I found the way. After I finished, I was asking a climber with a book which route was that and he said: "Marquis of Sade, 10c", that's when I found out it wasn't a hard 5.9.

    I felt like this route was poorly bolted above the roof, a fall will place you into the roof or onto the big ledge below, so don't fall at or just above bolt 4, IMO.    The first bolt was loose, I hand tightened it. The 4th bolt is loose and is spinning.

    The roof is tough, the crux in terms of strength moves. The thin stuff on the slab above scared me more than the crux though! Guess I need to practice 5.10 slabs, since with that combined with the crux, I would have given it harder than 10a.

    This is a nice climb.  Tricky for someone short without the ape-factor (I'm 5'4") to clip that 3rd bolt from the ledge before committing to the roof - I baaaarely reached it on tip-toes (a fall here would be ugly).

    Great route with some history from my point of view- something that speaks of vision and forward thinking. When I first stumbled across this route, not long after the FA, I had no clue what it was. I pretty much bagged on it on CB.com in my description submitted for the Lower Tier of Avalon. Remember, at the time there was little known or published about the area or the route. I complained that it was a worthless and dirty piece of junk. Moss and lichen all over, crumbling holds on the face, sharp, etc...    The ugly duckling did not become a beautiful swan or anything here, but it is at least a stately goose. The route has cleaned up nicely and is now a testament to the forward thinking and vision of Richard for equipping it. Crow tastes like chicken once I get past the feathers, I guess. Nice addition to the wall. Long and pleasant- one of the better routes here.

    Grungy down low, but excellent climbing from the roof to the top.  The crux is getting established on the steep slab above the roof, and it can be done in two different ways, as Ivan mentions.  I climbed straight up to the fourth bolt, and my partner stemmed up left and then stepped right at the fourth bolt.  From here, climb the steep slab on thin 5.9 edges to the top.

    Because I'm crazy and stupid, I did this with just the bolts, no trad. Sketchy, but pretty easy for 5.10c.

    Very fun climb.    Yes, it is hard at first I didn't protect it though, sometimes it is better for me just to go for the bolt then to waste energy hanging on a micro-crimp to set a piece.     After the first couple of bolts, it's easier and a little mossy.    The roof go to the left and stem up into a lie-back about 8 feet and I placed a 0.75 Camalot. That was fine until the anchor.    Commit to the moves!

    5.10b as a sport-grade. 9+ trad. The gear down below goes well as a red Alien, but at that time you are just below the bolt and one more move gets you there. The fingers are reasonably secure but the feet are not so good, so depending on strength and endurance, you may not want to bother with geat at all.  Up top, a smaller Alien would go left of the roof to reduce drag (green one?) and then maybe a #0.75 or #1 Camalot in the corner to the anchors. Climbers who feel largely secure on 5.10 could skip either the gear or the bolts, if they brought a rack.    Reasonably good climb with a trashy section in the middle.

    FYI - a foothold broke on me climbing this route this morning, the left foot just at the 'roof' (look in the picture at the bent red arrow, the foot hold was right where the bend is in that red arrow in the picture). Fortunately, belayer was standing to the side since we know full well how much loose junk is on this route. It was still a big surprise when the foothold broke though, since that part of the rock looked completely solid. Route grade is unaltered, simply smear a bit to the left of where the hold broke.    Lots of rockfall this year folks, be careful out there. Thats the real point of this post. :-)    bob    PS - at least the third time I've climbed this and I'd bet money I'd used that foothold before.

    Strenuous climbing that seems harder than 10c.  The flared  crack at the start saps arm strength while you're hanging out placing pro and clipping the first bolt. I used a red Alien to protect the opening moves. The crux is getting to the second bolt before you flame out; I find this easier to do climbing up left of the first bolt, laybacking my feet up the slanting crack.  Past the second bolt, the climbing eases significantly and goes through some bushy sections to the roof.  Bring a #.75 and #1 Camalot or equivalent to protect the upper corner after you turn the roof.

    I think the first crux jamming past the flake off the ledge is no harder than 5.9 and that the roof above the anchors for the nearby routes is also no harder than 5.9, epecially by wide crack standards found at Vedauwoo, South Platte, etc. But this is Boulder Canyon, so I could see a 5.10a rating for the whole route, but nothing higher. I also would not recommend splitting this into two pitches as one of the guidebooks suggests. The only reason to stop at the lower bolted anchor for Sword in the Stone is if you don't want to do the roof (which is quite fun and pretty mellow in my opinion).     Also, if you're doing the whole route, bring a #6 Camalot.

    I really enjoyed this climb as well and think Tony said it well -- it's just a little too solid for 5.11.  That being said, I think it is a little tricky as an onsight.  The easiest way through the roof is not the most obvious.  If you just charge straight through the roof, maybe it is 5.11.    I was glad to have (2) #3 Camalots, and at least (1) #4.  I think singles on everything else worked fine.    Unfortunately, the anchor is way off to the right, so getting a TR on this would be a bit of a pain.

    A pretty good climb with fun and interesting moves on great rock. Frankly, I was surprised at how good it was.  The crux is a great problem with good position in and of itself, but is a little too solid for the 5.11 grade. I'd put it below yardstick 5.11 roof/overhang moves such as Vertigo, or for that matter (given the width) perhaps I should compare it to The Diving Board, which is also harder.  Perhaps I found a different sequence, as this route seemed about the same if not slightly easier for me than The Anti-Sport, though I was informed I missed a crux jug on that one.  Solid 5.10 or 10+ for this route.  The difficulty of the climbing should not be a consuming argument, but I wanted to be sure that people are not unreasonably scared to try it.

    I wouldn't say this is anything like Vedauwoo personally, but I did find it quite fun, and a heck of a lot better than it looked from the ground, that's for sure.

    Fun route, but the first bolt is kind of in a bad spot. It's super easy, so you will probably never fall, but the bolt is at the edge of a piece of stone, so the biner on your draw kinda lies flat over the edge. It's super easy terrain up to like the third bolt, but if you did fall between the first and second, you could pretty easily snap your biner in half. Consider threading a sling through it and putting a biner on the end to avoid that.

This is thin face climbing on excellent (or better) rock  and if it were a full pitch long (3 times longer than it is) it would be a bona-fide classic, but as it stands it has to be listed as simply 40' of the best rock around...a measured compliment.

    Just did this route today, and have done a bunch of routes up at this crag. I am not sure if the folks claiming .11a stayed in the "Stigmata" crack for a while longer, but I tried to stay left, or true to the bolts, and found the moves quite consistent for the grade. While small holds are not really my forte, I can usually onsight this grade, and had a hard time even with the redpoint. Then again, could be a reach thing.

    Fun route. Too bad it's not a little longer. I led it today and felt like it was no harder than a 5.9-, max. I suppose if you try to keep both your hands and feet in the crack, that'd make it harder (much). But, there's too many options for your feet on the face. Well worth doing, though.

    Much more fun than Midway. Clean climbing on a well-bolted slab and you can even toprope it from the rings at the base of the pillar Rossiter describes in his BC guide.

Two stars because the start is a little contrived and the route traverses a good bit from start to finish. Rope-drag over the rock at the start can be a pain.~Wm

    Alternative BETA Alert: so I did this entirely differently... actually statically though I normally don't always climb statically.  I had my right hand gastoning the flake just left of crux bolt, then did a big cross over to the good part of the slot before the jug which made the left hand really positive.  This also allowed me to not be so scrunched at the crux when getting high feet.  Went right hand to sloping pinch below jug, got left foot to ticked hold, flagged right, and slowly went right hand to jug.  No throw needed at all.

    I had trouble onsighting this route with the crux clip as well. (I thought it was clip #6 - the one on the face, above the sloping crack, right before you go around the arete.) My right hand was in the sloping crack, left hand on the little side pull and no feet... I discovered the crux clip is actually ok for a 5'7" climber with 0 ape index if:    Clip easier bolt #4 (I thought it was #5).   Left hand on farthest left chalked hold, sideways crimp pocket. Approximately 1 foot left of the sloping crack. Approximately 1 foot left of the vertical flake/edge.    Left foot flags out left.  Right foot finds a little pocket underneath.  Reach up and right about 4-5 feet to the clip, clip it. Reset body position, breath, clip rope.    Then reset left hand to vertical flake/edge, move right hand over on sloping crack and throw for jug.    Excellent route, Richard!

    I just climbed this today.  Awesome route and my first 12a.  I found the 5th bolt to be difficult to clip as well.

    Regarding the bolts along the overhang.  Folks comment that the arrangement is weird and somewhat hard to clip.  This is because I set up this otherwise very cool route alone during the winter of 1996.  I couldn't find anyone (even Bonnie) to go up and belay me in the snow (and it was snowing), so I went up alone as usual, rapped from a tree on the upper ledge and set the ring anchors that are in use today.  I pulled the rope, threaded the rings and rappelled to the talus.      Using a Petzl Shunt I climbed the route and marked the bolts without the luxury of a belay.  At the crux, I blew out and fell away from the rock on the Shunt.  I could not reach the wall again, so I thought maybe I could rappel with the Shunt by pressing in against the gate.  I discovered that a Shunt is either on or off, you cannot rappel with a Shunt.  So I fell free to the talus and landed on my back.  I was just lying there with the snow falling in my eyes.  I thought sure I was injured. I moved my arms, my legs, my head and seemed to be OK.  I cautioned myself to be very careful getting up.  "You cannot fall this far and be OK," I thought.  But I was OK.    Now you know why the route is called FREE FALL.  I went right back up and finished marking the bolts with spots of chalk.  I soloed back to the anchors from Disinclination with the drill and set the bolts. This, I think, should explain why one or two of the placements are sort of hard to clip.  A few weeks later, after it stopped snowing, I went back with Bonnie and led the route for the first time.  I thought those clips were difficult too. It is still a good route, no?
    Jul 21, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Since I'm a wimp, I clipped the crux bolt a little early.  Actually, if you try clipping it one move before you naturally would, the right hand is bomber, and the clip isn't that bad.  Seemed better than clipping after moving up and right of the crux, because doing so is pretty committing.  Again depends on whether or not you want to take the fall down and left.    Nice route.  Don't miss the little toe-in spot for your left foot at the crux.

    May 4, 2004

    I agree with Chris.  Hard to onsight because of the location of the bolt at the crux.  The bolts are literally 3-4 feet apart through most of the middle section, so it's hard to believe that one could be in a bad place... but yet there it is.  As it is, the 5th bolt can only be clipped from smack in the middle of the crux... once the draw is hanging, it can be clipped by tall people before engaging the crux.  For the onsight, the best option would be to skip the clip and finish the crux, then clip the 6th bolt, risking a nasty swinging fall.
    Mar 24, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A fun and photogenic pitch on generally excellent holds.  The crux involves a short section getting to the arete where the feet run out. The two bolts at the crux are very close and seem to be oddly placed.  Clipping the second one is one of the hardest moves on the route.  Perhaps it would have been better to have placed one bolt lower and out right in place of the 2.

    Seeing recent discussions of the star system on the site, and climbing this route today gave me occasion to consider how I evaluate climbs.    I thought that Inclination was certainly worth doing, but I don't know that I'd recommend it to people.  I thought it was about as fun as Lothlorien down the hill at the Watermark, although the views were much better on Inclination.  I'd have to give it one star, maybe two.    I've generally considered the stars to mean as follows:     3 stars:  I loved the climb, plan to doing it again, and rave about it.    2 stars:  I enjoyed the climb, would recommend it to people, and might do it again (but wouldn't seek it out).    1 star:  I thought the climb was worth doing once, but I probably wouldn't recommend it.    0 stars:  I thought the climb was a waste of my time.    I'd agree that comparing a one pitch sport route in Boulder Canyon to a multi-pitch classic in Eldo doesn't make much sense.  In my mind, that's because I find myself in a different frame of mind, and having different expectations, when I go to each place.  When I go to Eldo, I know I need to be feeling good and confident because the gear might be tricky, and figuring out the moves, and committing to them, might take a lot of my mental energy.      But when I go to Boulder Canyon for sport climbing, I'm thinking more about feeling myself move over the rock, and I have little concern about the protection, or about taking a long fall.  I might be more inclined to push my physical limits, since my self-doubt and fears are easier to keep in check there.    The two areas simply CAN'T be judged against one another.  My enjoyment and satisfaction are different in each place.

    Soft 12a, but I think that's a fair grade. May feel easier if you're about 6' or taller (or have an equivalent ape index).    Really fun, gymnastic movement! 4* moves but can only give it 3* because it's so short. I found it much easier to skip the 4th bolt, as it's a fairly strenuous clip and the fall onto the 3rd bolt if you don't stick the deadpoint is totally clean (I checked, several times).

    Deadpoints are necessary as you are off balance the whole time, but no need to dyno.  Only beta I can give is to not clip the third bolt.  The fall is safe unless you fall while pulling rope for the 4th bolt, which probably won't happen because the clipping hold is a huge jug.

    I tried to lead this route but kept falling trying to get established above the roof, which led to some nasty swings. It is very easy to set up a tr on the bolts on the slab above. Once on tr I really think the deadpoint to the jug is the onsight crux, but it really isn't that far of a move.

    My first 5.12! I pulled the crux statically by having my feet high on the wall - there's a great, little, angled band of sharp rock to the left of the 3rd bolt that makes it easier to reach the jug if you're short like me. It's a nice short route.

    Agree that this seems easier than 12b.  The "dyno" from the sidepull can be done statically, just barely, for guys of average height.  It's a jug when you get there.  I thought the hardest part was pulling onto the slab above.  This is a fun route.  Thanks, Richard, for putting it up.
    May 20, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'm not quite sure if this is a 12, but I'll allow myself to be convinced to pump up my ego.  The climb is short but is pretty strenuous.  The fingerlock at the bottom is better than you think:  use your right hand in it with the index finger at the bottom.  It locks in there pretty well, or at least enough to get the left hand to the next ledge.  The crux for me is matching my hands on the little ledge above the third bolt and then getting my left hand to the bomber sidepull.  Then I can take my legs completely off and set them up for the dyno.  With the sidepull and your right foot in the proper location, the dyno is easy and not that much of a dyno.  Then you are on a big ledge with just a slightly tricky section to follow before the anchors.  Some people use intermediates to avoid the dyno, but I think it makes it harder.  I originally used a sequence that took me to the right and avoided the dyno, but I felt that was off-route so I abandoned that tack.

    In response to the AC: "No move harder than V3".  I agree, but when you have five or so 11+ moves in a row, ratings usually increase a little higher than 11+.  For example, in Indian Creek there are tons of routes that might not have a move harder than 5.10, but the route is rated 5.11 because of the sustained nature.

After a good rest out left, commit to the steep and complex mantle top-out. A key right hand sidepull up and right over the lip makes the 6th clip a whole lot easier. A must-do.

    I absolutely loved this route. One of the better routes I've ever done and def. the best thus far in the canyon. However, I thought Bob Antonio's rating of .11d was right...for me anyways...but I am 5'6" and with a short arm span...had to kind of dyno for that crimp.

    Tried it for the first time today. Fell 3 times amongst the 4th and 5th bolts. Super fun line that is well protected...here you can really focus on the moves. This route was really fun, and I will definitely be there time and time again to get it straight!

    Would agree w/ Clayton as a superb route for Avalon.  Not only is the crux move super fun &amp; aesthetic w/a great cross, but the climbing leading up to it flowed very nicely on good edges I thought.  Great moderate .11

    Best route I've done in Avalon.  Thought is was easier than 11c, but the movement was great.  Grabbed that crimp with the left and crossed with the right hand to gain the jug.  I'm only 5'9", so I wouldn't say it's height-dependent.  Great fun!
    Aug 12, 2007

    Yes, it's difficult if you're shorter. At 5'7", I could just barely reach the crimp at the crux but was able to pull through finally with the right sequence of moves and careful balance. Very nice route!
    Jun 4, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Maybe the best route I have done at Avalon. It seemed closer to what I'd expect at the grade, and pulling directly through the last overhang (need not go right as mentioned in a previous comment) was a surprising and fun finish. What great little holds! Might be really hard for short folks or short-armed folks.
    Jul 27, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Not sure whether your description says to go to the right at the last bolt in the photo (kind of sounds like it), but the best move on the route is to the left of the bolt, it's a dynamic (at least for me) reach to the left side of the lip. This is a great route, I wish I had the endurance to send it all at once, but I fell off of the lip the first try, after a short rest I got it fine.    I also recommend climbing all the way to the anchors right below the steep headwall at the top of the slab. Kind of run out, but easy and fun. An extra 40 feet of climbing and one bolt (the bolt is just below the anchors and is part of Disinclination).    Three stars for Boulder Canyon.

    Excellent route.  Continuously interesting and difficult.  Certainly 3 stars for Avalon.  I'm not sure how to grade route quality on these crags.  Is it better to grade quality compared to the routes on the crag or routes in the area?  I had been grading them based on other routes in the area, i.e., Boulder Canyon.  If graded compared to other routes at the crag, in my opinion, this pitch warrants 3 stars as does Free Fall, Ripcord, Chairman of Board, and Clipboard.

    Hands down, the best route at Middle Tier. Three dimensional climbing, spicy runouts, cool transitions as you work around the arete... this route has it all.  Way better, IMHO, than Strange Science, Riptide, or Freefall.

    I didn't use any additional gear.  The guidebook says to bring a few small cams.  They may be useful between bolts 3 and 4 and 4 and 5 if you are shorter.  For me, a fall before clipping bolt 4 would have been a hard swing into the wall below, and I couldn't reach bolt 5 from the ledge.  I also had difficulty reaching some of the holds in bolts 6 to 7 section.  I suspect those who are shorter are the ones who rate the climb 11.  If you are taller, it will seem easier.
    Jun 3, 2013

    This is a great route. I found the bottom three bolts to be thought provoking and balance intensive; while the top is powerful for an onsight.   As far as the grade, I'd say it's .11a if Free Willie is, which I found to be considerably less difficult.
    Sep 11, 2012

    This climb is not to be missed.  Interesting climbing the whole way, and while the bolted crack probably detracts from the climb, most people would just skip it rather than bring one piece of gear, so it seems justified.  Interesting moves up top with insecure feet on steep terrain, but it's definitely all there.
    Jun 10, 2010

    I am short, Alien not needed. High left foot and and good crimp in the crack allows to go up, clip the bolt and lower back down to the restful stance. The move is secure and quicker than placing an Alien a foot below a bolt.

    Young Doug...[Didn't] know the name when we did it. Thought it to be .10c/d-ish. Maybe my ape-index helps, but certainly there are no moves here that would be considered .11a..again, I must consider other benchmark routes at the grade. I am not a cutting-edge climber, but have 20+ years climbing in the Boulder area. I say that to lend some credentials to my stance on the grades. I would say this is a nice pitch, and well worth doing if you are up there..after all Boulder Canyon is a lot about quantity of routes in a day.

    Pretty solid climbing and probably like most at the cliff in that it is over graded at least a tad. Nice climb though, with good rock and fun moves. A lot of variety in the holds and moves keeps it interesting. Could get pumpy if you spent a lot of time trying to figure it out.

    This route is awesome and a must-do if you're at the Avalon. I don't know why it wouldn't get at least 2 stars. There's 2 bolts that are not necessary, as gear will protect their moves but the climbing is awesome.

    As a bit of additional information, it appears that a lot of the bolts Richard Rossiter used up at Avalon are actually 10mm and not 3/8".  These bolts use a 10x1 nut which is the reason why my 3/8" nuts wouldn't work on the hangerless bolt.  Luckily, McGuckin's carries the 10x1 nuts in both SS and plated.

    Richard Rossiter just added a new start to the route, up the arete left of the chimney.  A steep 5.8 face move gains the slab, then it's a cruise up to the anchors.  It's worth doing if the chimney is wet from recent rain.  See                        Tomb of Sorrows.   The new start goes up the arete at 5.8; the original start stems up the chimney at 5.9.        for details.

    Aug 1, 2013

    I guess I can't give myself the true onsight, since I climbed more of the arete on the top as opposed to the lieback crack which is apparently what was intended. The bottom climbing was delicate, and pulling the roof was pretty stout. Overall, a good route, not as good as its neighbors The Devil or Fapanese Direct. The top is definitely a bit contrived given that you can stay slightly right on the arete and make the whole upper half feel pretty casual. Good route though and worth getting on....
    Sep 4, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The fierce 11+ laybacking up top--regardless of how you take it, left or right---is indeed a spank-a-thon.    But mostly because you've spent yourself trying to get established under that hanging arete after you pulled the 11- roof. That 4th to 5th bolt traverse is certainly the crux.    And don't bother TRing this beaut'. The falls are casual swinging affairs. (I would know--took many of them), and once you hit the jug WAY up 'n' left, business hours are over and it's all good, so long as you brought extra arms.
    Jun 19, 2012

    The section by the 3rd/4th bolts is unquestionably the crux, unless people are climbing the crack 4 feet to the right on the Devil. Solid 5.12 when you stay on the bolt line here.  The description above calls the arete up high the crux, whereas I thought that part was only 11+/12-.

    The first bolt and the seventh bolt were spinning bolts (not just spinning hangers which is no big deal - the actual bolt was spinning). Both hangers were a bit out from the rock too.    Replaced both of those today with glue-ins, the first with a large Twisted Leg bolt (316 ss), the seventh with a Fixe Hely (Duplex 2304 stainless steel aka PLX). I managed to pull the first bolt cleanly and re-use the hole, but the seventh bolt broke at the neck (after a lot of work), so a new hole was needed (the old hole was patched).    The right bolt at the anchor also spins if you try to tighten it with a wrench, but it doesn't move at all when weighted straight out, and considering how difficult it was to remove the spinning pro bolts, I can't imagine any scenario where the anchor bolt could fail.

    Solid 11b or easy 11c IMHO. Previous comments about bailing right towards the gully at the flaring crack are dead-on. There are also some sidepulls left just above the horizontal sloper/crack which I'd say need to be off-route for it to be 11b. With a little wandering left and right, it's still probably 10c or 10d.    Fantastic climb overall. Sustained with interesting moves. Bolting is very safe and well done.

    When I got on this I thought I was warming up on a 10d and looked at the top move and balked- I cheated right by grabbing an edge around the corner. Then I came down and did it direct and decided that it was pretty doable that way too, but the feet are somewhat poor. I think it was easy 5.11 (11a or 11b) if done directly through the flared crack, moderate 5.10 (10b or 10c) if cheating to the right up top. Regardless, fun and pumpy.
    Jun 22, 2005

    Look for a 6" tall, WAY overused 'cheater-stump' at the base of this climb. For .11d, it seems reasonable that the line runs straight through the flared crack at the top (look at Ron Olsen's third photo below), and not right then back left to the rings. Much easier to bypass the would-be crux if you do go right at the flared crack, then back left again at the rings.~Wm

    Yes, there are two ways to climb this route. In September 2009, I redpointed this route &amp; thought it was the easiest .12d I had ever done. My partner, Henry Lester, was working on this route moving onto the arête above the roof, at 6th bolt, &amp; then following the arête. I tried this briefly, &amp; it seemed quite hard. So I followed the seam up the face. Just past 7th bolt, the short, discontinuous hand crack provides a nice rest before the crux traversing left to the arête. Being tall, I am able to span from a sidepull on the seam to the arête. A shorter climber might still find this crux .12d, because they would have to hang on a tiny edge. The next section up the arête, past 8th bolt seemed 5.12, but soon I was able to turn the arête for a rest. There is still more hard moves to the last bolt.

    I would give this route four stars but for the bolt placement leading into the crux.
    Apr 7, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree with Pinklebear. I think the FA party envisioned climbing the arete, but there ended up being an easier way up the face to the right of the bolt line. With that said, the crux for me was actually reaching the bolts to clip draws. Hanging the draws for me and sending was completely out of the question, I was nowhere near being able to reach. I actually had to extend a bunch of draws and ended up skipping some on redpoint, because I could barely reach the extendos I had set up. Clearly for me the crux was making the clips. All clipping aside, the route on the face flows very nicely and the transfer from the crack out right to the arete was very cool moves. The stone is very nice on this one and overall a great climb. Appropriately graded too, I thought it was a touch harder than the route to the right....
    Sep 24, 2014

    Got on this today, and I think it's a great line. I climbed to the right of the bolts then traversed to a good horn on the arête. I think 12d is a fair grade for it. Overall, a very aesthetic climb with great moves and an awesome position. Classic.
    Sep 17, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Pretty line but a bit nebulous. It seems bolted to keep you out left on the arete, but there is a good crack and sidepulls on the right, though these make clipping way out down and left kind of hairball. You can even get in a nice hand crack at one point and rest. At a certain point, the bolt line forces you to come back left (at least high up, to the horn), though you could just keep going right with some trad gear. Maybe there is a more direct way left onto the arete lower down? Seems to be a little height/wingspan dependent. Didn't send but don't know if I'll be back....
    May 5, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I was confused by this line in the way Reboot mentions above. There seemed to be several places to traverse left to the arete from the crack above the first roof. We figured out at least three. It always seemed like the natural line wanted to take you up and right but the bolts to the left. Kind of nebulous but good rock at the very least.

    I highly doubt that this didn't see a 2nd ascent for 9 years until last summer.  This is a strikingly obvious line on a very popular crag.  Not to mention that there are probably 100+ people living in the Boulder area at any given time who can climb the grade.  Most people wouldn't report it if they had redpointed a 12+ route.    As for the grade... the route is VERY condition dependent.  When I got on this in July, I thought it was the hardest 12d that I'd ever been on.  30 degrees cooler this weekend and it felt like its grade.  Nevertheless, this is certainly one of the best hard-12s in Boulder Canyon.     BTW, if you manage to pull through the secondary crux (spicy) you will have no trouble doing the 5.10 finish without gear.  Also, there is no tree below the route to hit if you fall.

    Can't really comment on the grade, as I didn't get it clean, but the description is very accurate.

    One awkward move to an easy upper climb. It isn't bad enough to 'bomb' but it isn't good enough to bother with either.  There are better wastes of time around. I suppose if every other route around is full, you can justify doing this one... 40' doesn't take long at least! As well, my partner referred to this as a "trad climb with bolts on it."  It would take gear just fine, but at least it's not a singular and obvious crack.

    Not a bad route, and really not too hard. I don't know about 5.11... this seemed no harder than the starting move of the roof to the right (rated 10c).
    Jul 23, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    We top-roped the route from the anchor on Wheel of Fortune.  The moves past the bolt at the initial overhang were pumpy and hard to figure out.  The cracks above the overhang were much easier.  They felt like 5.8, but we were top-roping, not leading.
    Jul 22, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    In retrospect, I think the route is probably about 5.11a.  When you lead a new line for the first time it always seems more difficult than it actually is.  The hardest move is probably getting stood up at the lip of the roof.  Above this it is maybe 5.10a on killer jams and 5.9 after that.  Climb all the way to a large (and stable) perched block at the level of the descending rings.  Reach left and you have it.  The Horse is fun.  I can't wait to do it again.    The route is named for the Knight of Cups in the Tarot, who rides a great white stallion above the cresting waves of a vast sea and holds the Grail in his outreaching arms.

    The lower section can be done with gear all the way till you reach the flared handcrack before the upper slab. Just take doubles from 0.4 to 0.75 and a few alpine draws. Gear is bomber!

    In my opinion, the definition of a classic sport route. It's long and sustained with great moves the whole way, though the real winning feature is how varied the climb is. From the face moves to the hand jams to the dihedral, it's pure goodness every step of the way.    Get on this.    Edit: Andrew, your draws were MIA, hope you got them back.

    Loved every second of this route. I don't think there's any 10d moves on it, but it's pretty sustained, and being pumped going into the 10a corner at the top means it's really not over until you clip the chains. For me, the crux was just after traversing left out of the alcove right of the bolt line. I thought this was a good bit harder than Marquis de Sade down below.     On another note, I clipped the chains right as some nasty lightning came in. In a rush to get off, I left two alpine draws in the chains. If you find them in good condition, they're yours, though I'll give someone $5 bucks and beer to return them

    I loved this route. Definitely a great, well-protected line perfect for anyone trying to boost their leading skills into the 5.11 realm.     It is an entertaining, engaging route. It doesn't just "go up" but makes you think: Solid laybacks, fun footwork, and pumpy sections make this one a favorite in my book.    Would call it a 5.10b/c relative to the other stuff in Avalon.

    Hangerless (mistake?) bolt just short of the the anchors? Cool climb. 10d seems too hard and 4 stars seems to many. But, then again, I don't like cracks :). Could easily lose some bolts and be a mixed route, but, whatever.

    I agree with Chad here. Climbing at the top is similar to the pin-ladder on Eldo's Yellow Spur. After I got back to the car, I kept saying "There's no WAY that's .10d!" By no means am I a ".10d climber" and I only hesitated once or twice on this route. I'd call it a .10b I think. If you're not a .10d climber, I wouldn't be afraid of this route. Many many bolts and the cruxes aren't that hard. At the top, follow the bolt line to the rings, don't wander right where the chalked ledges are.~Wm

    This is also my favorite line at Avalon.  Thanks to Ron for the beta that helped me find this one.  Climbed this between rain squalls on 7/5/04.  The climbing is interesting and varied.  It seems possible that you could climb this with half the bolts or perhaps without any bolts at all given the abundant cracks on the route.

    Ron, I always find it interesting that people can have such different experiences on routes, really one of the values of this site.  I certainly thought this route was harder than Marquis de Sade, you found the opposite to be true.  Something came to mind after climbing in Eldo yesterday, this route would probably compare to 9+ there.

    My favorite route at Avalon.  Climb up into a little alcove, then make an exciting traverse left onto the face.  Work up the steep face (10b/c) and climb a corner/slab (10a) to the anchors.  The route is 90' long.

    I thought this might be more 5.10b (?) (via direct start by the two bolts) as I had to hang there before getting the moves (I'm currently more of a 10a onsight Boulder Cyn sport leader). I felt like there were three progressively easier cruxes--the first getting past the 2nd bolt, the second crux at the 3rd bolt (traversing slightly right on chossy rock might make it easier), and a third crux getting past the 4th and 5th bolts. Beware, the sixth bolt at the top of the climb, which will protect your second from a pendulum off of the anchors (which are off to climber's right), could be hidden if the plant that is up there grows out any more. I used a couple of medium stoppers and a few finger to hand-sized cams to protect between the bolts. Initially, to protect yourself as you work up to the first two bolts, you can put in a pretty bomber finger-sized cam while standing on the start ledge, go up and clip the two bolts, then come back down to clean the cam. Oh, and the supposed 5.9 variation just to the left (a corner) to start this might be a tad stiff...my buddy who followed had difficulties on it and he normally can cruise 5.9.
    Jun 17, 2017
</strong></blockquote><blockquote>
    Did the 5.9 variation. Fun but a bit of a strange line. Lots of zig-zagging. Definitely bring a bunch of slings. You can sew it up in the beginning and in between the bolts. Still a large death block about 3/4 of the way up that will almost certainly fly straight at your belayer! Have fun!

    Dale Haas and I went up there on 6/2/16 and put a new hanger, washer, and nut on the 5th bolt. We also tightened all the other bolts on the climb, so hopefully this won't be a problem in the near future.    As far as the quality of climbing on the route...I think the climb is better and more fun doing it via the 5.9 handcrack start on the left.

    Rotten rock, loose blocks, a stupid finish, and lots of lichen make this a climb to avoid. Climbing straight up the bolt line at the start also seemed to be harder than any of the other 10s I've done at Avalon.
    May 23, 2016

    It definitely dirt, a lot of lichen up top, but still a fun route.  I did the 9 and 10 start.  I would call the 10 start a 10-, it didn't seem much harder than the 9 start, and before you know it you're back on the same route. I did like fact that it is mixed, placing gear increased the fun.

    Maybe the L hand start is better. But I thought that climbing up the line to the right side of the bolts was more than a little sketchy. Not so much that there's loose rock, more like there's huge sections where everything is simply decomposing.    So long story short, it's not really cleaned up. There's even loose flakes/holds from the last ledge to the chains.  Just a heads up.
    Apr 22, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I think the direct start on this one goes at about .10c .  I don't really see the point in bolting only half the route, the addition of two bolts to this route would make it a much safer line.  I actually climbed to the horizontal before realizing I needed gear.  This was in part because I could see bolts higher up, and also saw the two bolts close together down low, so I figured it was well bolted.  I would not be surprised if others made the same mistake.
    Aug 14, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    With some traffic to clean it up, this will turn into a nice addition to Avalon. Several cruxes and nice variety. Kudos for leaving it a mixed route and not bolting the whole thing. Bring a couple of long slings, and save one for the last bolt (over the top), so the rope will run more smoothly to the anchors on the right.
    Aug 20, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Not the most aesthetic climb, but fun moves throughout.  The bolt line for the top portion of the climb takes a hard left at the overhang and then comes back right again to the anchors.  Best to use a long sling on your cam/nut placement before taking the hard left.

    I like this route but am unsure about the rating. I thought it was a 5.9, but my friend thought it was harder than the 5.10b near it. Maybe it is reach dependent? I have 6" arm reach on him, so maybe that's why.    I thought this route was no harder than the 5.8s at Sport Park. I also thought the crux was at the 6th bolt, getting into that large chimney-like section.     Either way, wonderful climbing. Be careful with a 60m rope.
    Jul 5, 2010

    I felt this one had some more awkward moves (reachy for me) than some of the surrounding 5.9s, so I would claim a 5.10a on it...really fun though! I took one fall trying to switch my right hand from a crack to the knob a bolt or two above the first roof section! Would do it again!
    May 28, 2010

    Definitely felt like 10a.  And, did this with a 70 meter rope and had only 10 ft of rope to spare.  If you're using a 60 meter, be sure to tie in or knot the ends.
    Aug 21, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If a slingshot belay is desired, the leader can be lowered just just left of the climb. This reduces the rope drag, but a belay at the anchors would be better.    Also, to second the opinion, this would (and still could be lead as) an excellent trad climb.
    May 28, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Great route!  Maybe it was the exposure, but the first move above the roof and into/up the right-facing corner felt at least 10a.  Also, I would recommend the leader belay the second from the anchors as the rope runs right through a nasty crack at the top of the corner/second roof creating huge rope drag and cutting potential.  There is plenty of space to belay from the anchors.
    Jul 5, 2007

    This is an excellent, moderate route, and I agree with Ron on its 10a rating.  Kudos to Richard for establishing this splendid sector.
    Aug 24, 2005

    Good route.  I thought the 10a crux was on the upper half of the route, pulling onto the face then up into the awkward right-facing corner.
    May 7, 2005

    This is a fun route and one of the best of its grade at Avalon.  Bring a 60m rope; the route is 100' long.  If you lower, be aware that the climbing line is well left of the lowering line, and the rope runs right over the edge of the roof. It's easiest to have the second clean the pitch while following.    The hardest moves on the climb: at the 4th bolt below the roof and stepping right into the corner above the roof (crux). Seemed like 10a by Boulder Canyon sport-climb standards.

    I didn't do the route before the rockfall, but the move on the face was  a bit harder than 10a, especially after doing Lust just before this route.  Overall not really worth the time with many better climbs around.  But I can agree to disagree.
    Aug 3, 2007

    I was surprised to read about rockfall on this route, as it is still fully intact as a one-move 10a sport route.  However, that one move is interesting, making this not a bad warmup for something better like Lust.
    Aug 2, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Unfortunately, there is now only one option for the crux, and that's directly up the face. The 100 pound "pebble" now at the base of the climb used to be jug on the left traverse option.

    There seems to have been significant rockfall off this route, as there is a big scar below the crux headwall and lots of new looking boulders on the belay ledge.

    Ron Olsen said: "This is a two-star route by Avalon standards."    Just how DO we assign quality ratings? Under Resources/Terminology /Route Evaluations there is no mention of assigning stars on a per-crag basis, so I've been assuming quality stars are assigned on a site wide basis, e.g., a two star 80 foot sport route at Avalon must be as good as a two star multipitch Eldo route. And hence, I feel most sport routes rate only one star. That's not good, since, if someone wants to climb sport in, say, Boulder Canyon, they want to know this: Given that I plan to climb sport in Boulder Canyon, which are the good routes? It doesn't matter that a 3 star sport route may not compare with Ruper, Yellow Spur or the Edge.    On the other hand, assigning stars on a per-crag basis isn't very useful.

    Wow. So much bullshit on this comment list. This is one of my FAVORITE climbs in Avalon. Yes, it may not need bolts, or that many-but some of us do not trad climb, nor do some of us think that it is worth the risk to us (a personal decision). I would not be able to climb this without the bolts. Period. We are not all trad climbers guys. Some of us are sport climbers. Some of us are boulderers, and some of us are aid climbers, ice climbers...but we all love climbing. Take your negativity and selectiveness somewhere away from the rest of us.

    We started on this when we were told it was a 9.  Cool climb with good moves but it is more like 9+.  Also, bring the trad rack and skip the bolts if you want because there is plenty of natural pro.    [Edit 9/1/07]  Climbed this on gear today without any problems.  The bolts aren't necesary, but they don't bother me either.  Gear (in order of placement)  sling horn, grey Alien, 0.5 Camalot, green Alien, #2 ballnut, #1 Camalot, #2 Camalot, red Alien.  Still felt pretty easy for the grade.    PS.  Sorry Richard, but this area is turning into a Sport Park.  At least 30 people at Middle Tier today.  It's a testament to good routes though; people want to climb them.  We all appreciate your work and efforts.    Cheers    CL

    After doing this route again today, found an easier sequence for the finish and now realize why the last bolt was unnecesary and hanger removed just below the chains.  High reach left for the corner off the right finger lockout makes this finish easier, than working that right crack all the way up...fun climb.

    I got to do this route yesterday and really enjoyed it.  It is an interesting sport route because of the finger cracks.  There are no real cruxy moves, although there are a couple of points at which a delicated stance is required for the clip.  The first time I led it I thought getting my fingers in the last crack to get to the anchors was the crux, but the second time I realized that a better foot placement makes this less difficult.

    Regarding the route Dominator at Avalon, I am surprised to see so many comments posted for this route.  I became fascinated with Avalon in 1996 while drawing topos of the routes Earth Angel and Black Tiger.  Though overgrown and obscure, the crag (then unnamed) looked promising and had no other known routes.  It was a serious bushwhack just getting to the bottom of the walls.  But it turned out to be great place and I kept putting up routes there until my nearly fatal bicycle crash in November 2002.     As for the Dominator, the wall was so dirty and exfoliated, climbing the debris-filled bits of crack seemed unreasonable...hence the bolts.  After hundreds of ascents the route has cleaned up pretty well.  Based on the posted comments, a few people seem upset about the bolts. I think the route (now) has too many bolts and I will be happy to remove some of them myself, but not all of them.  The Dominator has become a popular climb as it is.  It would disappoint many people if I removed all the bolts, and for nothing.    Tony Bubb mentions that I was in Special Forces, which is true.  I served three years in Special Forces during the Vietnam War and had several of my friends blown to smithereens in places that weren't in the news.  Perhaps some of these guys complaining about bolts should try out for Special Forces.  If they can make the cut, they might get a lesson in reality and find out what matters in life and what doesn't.  Having been all the way out on the edge and come back alive, I would suggest that the arrangement of bolts on a climbing route is pretty trivial stuff.    By the way, I never envisioned this crag as a sport park and I hope it never becomes one.  See Crack Land, Blade, The Horse, Tunnel of Love, et cetera.  Cracks are good, yes?    Richard

    I Emailed Rossiter and asked his opinion, but it bounced. His Email changed since the last time I talked to him. I think it will be for the better if he does comment, then we can all debate the facts with that in light, not impressions of what might have been.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Rossiter did Dominator in 2001. He put in Eight Miles High at Sleeping Beauty in 2000. He says this of Eight Miles High: "I would like to comment on the superfluous bolts just right of the initial crack. As you may know, I have cleaned, set up and led hundreds of new routes along the Front Range in Colorado. It has never been my practice to bolt usable cracks. Looking back at this route now, I don't know what the hell I was thinking. If these bolts are offensive to most people, I will be happy to remove them myself. "    Perhaps Richard regrets also the bolts on Dominator.    As for cleaning the route justifying bolting, how much cleaning, if any, was necessary? There were at least several trad routes climbed at Avalon prior to Rossiter developing the crag. I doubt if those trad lines were cleaned top down. And, if Dominator did not need cleaning, perhaps it had been climbed trad previously. See Life on Mars on Wake Up Wall/Lost Angel/Dream Canyon for just one example of an unreported trad climb that has since been bolted.

    I may have jumped to the lowbrow when I said Jackass, but hey, that's what I thought, and Richard is an adult. I'm sure he understands where I'm coming from - he's been in the climbing game long enough to know the decision he was making when bolting next to a crack was not going to be praised by everyone who climbs his legacy.      I now live in the PNW and at the crags in Washington, BC, etc, the need to clean a climb before it can be sent doesn't have the mystique it seems to have here.  As if the act of cleaning a crack of dirt or prying loose rocks from a climb somehow transforms the climb into some kind of "style free" zone.  Hardly.  At Index  (near where I live in WA - awesome granite climbing btw) the vegetation is so severe and fast acting that almost yearly cleaning is needed or the forest retakes the climbs.  Yet the need to clean a climb doesn't mean that it's then free to bolt up - nay, it just means the cracks will now accept cams or stoppers, and climbers or belayers (hopefully!) won't get a granite sandwich when on the climb.      For whatever reason, Rossiter chose to bolt this climb and the act of cleaning does not negate this breach of style.  I really do enjoy many of Rossiter's climbs. This, however, is not one of them.

    I agree that this route is overly bolted; with or  without the crack features, but it is a very fun climb.    Here's my question for Joe and everyone else who feels the same way:  Why does chipping a hold offend you so much but cleaning "hundreds of pounds" of rock and dirt from a "climb" warrant congratulations and praise?  Are there not billions of organisms (plant, insect, animal, etc.) living in the rubbish that needs cleaning?  Aren't you still altering the rock and your "climb" to suite your style and needs?

    Richard Rossiter put in the time and effort to do the FA of this route the way he wanted it done.  It has been enjoyed by many people since then.  If you don't like the route, then you should have done it first, the way YOU wanted it done.  And no, it's not too late.  There are still plenty of "trad" climbs waiting for you out there - it just takes work - so don't complain after somebody else has done it.  And that's the real problem: it's easier to flap your gums on a website than to go out and do a first ascent, particularly if you know hardly anybody will enjoy your "trad" route.

    Charles-  I agree, a bolted splitter is about the most repulsive thing I can think of.Dominator is far from splitter, though it does have crack features that perhaps could have best been left for natural pro.      Kirk- I agree that any action is open to criticism.  What raises flags for me and prompted my response, is the incredibly overly self-important and myopic view of climbing that a lot of people on this site seem to display on a regular basis.  One poster used a tone reserved for criminals and cheats, then backed off when he realized he was calling Rossiter out.A little overblown for a short Avalon route don't you think?

    I totally agree with Joe.  People forget about all the work that goes into getting the routes in good enough condition to climb.  It may have been so dirty that you couldn't have wiggled your widgets in the cracks in 2001.  As for Charles comment, we're not talking about splitter cracks here, and I again I agree with Joe and AC, aside from chipping, that if you want the line done in your own fashion, go clean it, lead it, and publish it.  It's that simple!  It's not about sport climbing or leave it.  It's about getting off your complaining butt and doing some work yourself.  The majority of new routes going in aren't bolted cracks and are done in "good" taste. Fellow AC, you beat me to the punch.      P.S. You're a jackass to call Richard or anyone that, Mike W.

    Sure, up until now the route had not been climbed, but just because nobody had done the work to clean it doesn't mean it's free and clear for people to do anything without criticism.    Another point.  I reserve the right to disagree with people who bolt cracks, while at the same time thanking them profusely for the really great, fun routes that they've put up and all the incredible work they've done.  It's a little like being told "sport climbing, love it or leave it" and I think it's a little unfair.    It looks like this route (like Headline on the Little Eiger) has been overbolted, though I bet it's fun to climb.

    Joe, I more or less agree with you, except it's not all that clear to me why you make an exception for chipped holds.  Personally (speaking in general terms), a bolted splitter would bother me more than a route with chipped holds.  Not feeling argumentative--just curious.

    From boulderclimbs.com:FA- Richard Rossiter and Von Grebe, 2001    I'm not justifying bolting cracks, but again, just like for Little John's Big Stick, some Boulderites have the uncanny knack for losing all sense of perspective.     Michael, Stefan, etc-  don't you think there must be a reason why this wasn't climbed trad pre-2001?  Because it was likely a hanging pile of choss, which only became a climb once several hundred pounds of loose rock were cleaned.  It's still a one-star route at a one-star crag, and in my mind, if someone is willing to put the time and effort into a route like this, then they can develop it in the style they see fit (sans deliberately chipped holds, of course).

    I climbed this route last weekend.  I started up and clipped the 1st bolt, then looked up at the remainder of the route, cleaned my draw and downclimbed.  I couldn't clip the bolts in good conscience, especially after my girlfriend carried a rack of cams up to the crag!      I grabbed a single run of cams and a few nuts out of the pack and headed up.  I ignored the bolts and placed 7 pieces of gear, all bomber, ranging from green Alien size to #3 Camalot size.  I could have easily placed more, but 7 pieces was actually feeling a bit excessive.      There are 8 unneeded bolts on this climb!
    Sep 14, 2004

    Nice route, but I was disappointed with the excessive use of bolts.  Spacing bolts 2 or 3 feet apart on a steep face like this doesn't make much sense, and completely removes any sense of exposure or excitement.  There was also excellent natural protection available, making one wonder why the bolts were there at all.  Maybe it's too late, but I hope this area isn't becoming another Sport Park.

    I thought this was hard. I was expecting 10a based on Rossiter. I was self belaying, and struggling with what that entails took its toll, and I ended up hanging twice. Unlike most of the other sport climbs I've been on at Avalon, the rating of this one seems pretty real.    However... this would have been even better as a trad climb (speaking as a trad climber--of course all you sport-only clilmbers may disagree). There is excellent gear everywhere except near the top of the initial corner. Even there there is gear, but you have to look around a bit, and it may be a bit funky. Climbing it trad (not that many would, but you could) may bump up the difficulty a letter grade or two.

    Good for struggling 10 leader since bolts are very close together.  Super fun tradesque climbing, in fact the route could go with no bolts, just good gear.  Seems to have cleaned up, I didn't notice much loose.

    This is "Dominator", FA: R. Rossiter and B. Von Grebe. Richard calls it 10a so let's split the difference... say 10b. Steep and pumpy, it is a bit sandy with some suspect flakes but should clean up okay. "Dominatrix" (of course) is the mixed route to the left (one bolt?).

    Did the "10a" variation. Felt about 5.9. Pretty close to a bomb route. The 5.8 variation to the right (with the bolt) looks like the better choice. The rock on the cracks is grungy and questionable. I angled slightly left to hit the arete, then back right on a "slab" to rejoin the other variation at a fist crack. The upper dihedral is a little dirty, but at least it's not going to fall off on you.

    Definitely boltless and anchorless.  I ended up climbing to the anchors for Dihedral One (not recommended, massive rope drag).  I think there's one or two 5.7 moves in the corner, right off the ledge.
    Mar 14, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The description says gear to a 2 bolt anchor.  I could not find an anchor... the rocks up top look a bit loose and I'm not sure what I would bolt.  I built a gear anchor and walked off to the left.    I did this and Dihedral 1 and they both seemed substantially easier than 5.7.  Comparing to other trad climbs in the area, I would say they are no harder than Breezy on the Wind Tower in Eldo (which is 5.4) and certainly not as hard as Tigger there which goes at 5.5.  I suppose it depends on what you are comparing them to, but calling this a 5.7 trad climb just doesn't seem right.  It is orders of magnitude easier than North Face Center (5.7) on Cob Rock (or Empor (5.7+)).    I don't like it when people sandbag, but everyone I was with thought these were easy, and if North Face Center on Cob is setting the 5.7 standard for Boulder Canyon trad, then these ought to be several grades easier.

    The best sport route we did today. I'd definitely do it again. 5.9+ seems appropriate, and if you're out of shape, it'd be fair to maybe call it 5.10a.

    A fun route of the "why does it have a plus" variety.  Awkward/unexpected positions and being over vertical for some moves make it a plus for me.    A great route because they holds are indeed big 5.9 holds, but you need to move smartly.  If you're struggling with a move, consider that you're probably doing it wrong and need to look around for somewhere else to grab or put your foot to make it a 5.9 move.    The 5th bolt needs the extended draw to avoid some ugly dragging - a shoulder length sling would be a good length.

It is not OK for your dog to leave a pile of shit at the bottom of a crag.  As of this Sunday, there is a big pile of dog shit at the bottom of the route Dead Can Dance at Avalon.

    One and a half stars- maybe 2 for this cliff. Nice climb, and tastefully done.  The gear is straightforward and solid. As well, it is supplemented by 2 bolts, one just before the crux.  It would be easy to escape right to the route "Dead Can Dance" just to the right. So perhaps this is an ideal beginner trad lead for the competent sport climber who has just taken up the rack.

    A great addition to Avalon; sustained, interesting climbing from bottom to top.  Surmounting the crux bulge at the second bolt requires good balance and footwork.  The cracks above protect well and are enjoyable to climb.

    This is a lead version of  a previous TR called SARCOPHAGUS, 11a, but does not turn the initial roof, hence the lighter rating.  Begin in the same RFD as Dead Can Dance. Stem up and stretch left to clip the first bolt on this route.  Pull left into the line and climb straight up, mostly on gear.  There is one more bolt at a blank section about halfway up.  Lower off,  60 feet?  Two stars I guess on the Avalon scale.  The gear is very fun.

    So it isn't perfect, I had fun. Some thinking required.    Now it's 3 yrs after I wrote this comment. I climbed it again, I like the start. It is fun, but the upper sections are just annoying that they are harder than 10b or you are forced to go right, which seems off route. You should still do it while you're here though...but I reduced my rating from 3 to 1 star.

    Rarely am I one to comment on the way a climb was bolted due to the sheer effort put in.  Here though, I don't understand this route and the bolting at all.  It's definitely contrived if you follow the bolt line and stay off the things to the right.  To me though, it's so close to the easier things on the right that you might as well have bolted that area instead.  When I was climbing this today, I wanted to go left, but there was so little there and no chalk whatsoever I felt off route.  I just wished I was on something else and that rarely happens.  If one wanted us to climb the harder portions of this to the left, I think the bolt line should have been even farther to the left and this would go at high 5.10s or even 11.      I say, avoid this route, and climb either Dead Again or Strange Science to enjoy your day.
    Apr 10, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I found this route fun if you stay on the bolt line (hard for a 5.10b I thought). My partner who went up right and stuck to the crack(probably a 5.9 or so) also enjoyed it... so maybe it's contrived, but it's fun either way.
    Nov 23, 2011

    Peeps definitely need to be a little easier on this route, because it is great for learning the speedbumps of 5.10 climbing.  There are trust issues here, but hey we all have a little bit of those, right?
    Oct 9, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree - it's frustrating when 'bailing right' means using the better holds that are a safe, easy reach from the bolt line. The bolts could direct you left more if that's what was really intended.
    Aug 5, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a 10 if you go straight up the bolts, but if you reach right it can go as easy as 5.9 or 5.8.  I don't like routes where holds 1 foot right of the bolts are "off," since they seem contrived, but if you climb it as a 5.9 then it is fun.
    Sep 20, 2008

    If 5.10 is your limit, this will feel very hard.  If you warm up on .10s, skip this one and do the next one to the right (Dead Again).

    I climbed it last weekend and found it enjoyable.  The rock was clean and solid, with the exception of the loose crack to the right of the first few moves (although using the crack isn't necessary anyway).

    Bob D'Antonio's book called this 10b. I found it pretty hard by Boulder Canyon standards. I also placed a yellow Mastercam going from 3rd to 4th bolt.     Prod.

    A good pitch and solid for the grade.  Balance on sidepulls to make your way through the crux.  There's a blue Alien placement to supplement the bolts.  No need for gear above the anchor if you are making your way to resurrection.
    Aug 19, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The tree above the finish to Ancient Fright is gone.  A gigantic boulder tipped over and shattered the tree, but did not quite break it off. Thus  the boulder teetered precariously against the tree, 200 feet above the approach gully.     I came up with a tree surgeon's saw on a 10-foot fibre glass pole and cut the tree until it snapped under the weight of the boulder.  This was a hairy opperation as I had to get down even with the base of the tree to wield the saw.  This boulder was literally the size of a VW bug, but of solid granite.  It is difficult to even speculate how much it weighed.  When the boulder fell, it ripped a path through the forest below about 10 feet wide and 200 meters long...most of the way to Boulder Creek.      I felt I had to fell the tree under controlled circumstances rather than when the tree finally gave way on its own.  In any case, you can no longer belay or rappel from this tree.      FYI: I returned during the summer of 2006 and placed a 2-bolt ringe anchor on the east wall of the recess beneath Resurrection (in place of the fallen tree).  Richard Rossiter

    A steep and sustained pitch; hard climbing from the third to the fifth bolts with minimal stances.  The crux is at the fourth bolt.  We continued up to the tree at the start of Resurrection instead of lowering from the 2-bolt anchor.    We approached via Ancient Light, a good pitch with excellent airy climbing on the upper arete.

    This is a highly underrated climb and needs to get some more traffic on it!  Make the venture up and out of the usual Avalon crowds to find this hidden gem.  The 1st pitch is probably far easier than 10c, but perhaps the necessity to avoid wet moss and vegetation along with a slightly awkward but very cool, airy traverse makes it a 10.  Awesomely fun, and well done finding this line to the original bolters!
    May 27, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    With a few longer slings, doing it as one long pitch is the way to go... you'll want to skip some bolts in easy territory &amp; both inetmediate anchors to keep the drag down, but it's not hard where this is beneficial.
    Jun 19, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Dirty down low and still plenty of moss on the route.  2nd half is good when you move left to the arete.  This was a good link into Ancient Fright to Resurrection to summit Avalon.  If you do this, go to the top anchor.
    Aug 19, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    On the first pitch, the crux traverse left to the arete may be harder than 10a for shorter climbers.  At 6'1", I was able to reach some good holds to pull myself across, but my shorter partner had a lot of trouble here.  Rossiter's 10c rating may be more accurate for shorter climbers.    If you're going to do the second pitch, continue past the first anchor (on a pedestal just below the grassy ledge) up to the grassy ledge and an anchor on the wall above it.  This makes the pitch  80' long with 9 clips instead of 8.
    Sep 3, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The second pitch is interesting and varied.  Climbing around the pillar and up to its top is quite different from the typical Avalon face climb.  Laybacking the roof is straightforward, once you get in the proper position.  The upper face was steep and sustained, with a 10b move at the 4th bolt and a 10d move at the fifth bolt.  You can climb straight up past the fifth bolt with a long reach to a good pocket, or go left to a flared hand crack.    I placed a #.75 Camalot in the left side of the pillar after the second bolt, a #.5 Camalot and a #3 Camalot after the third bolt, and a yellow Alien after the fifth bolt.

    My partner and I climbed 8 pitches (including the Art of War) on the 3rd Tier of Avalon on Saturday, June 10th.  This climb and Ancient Fright were probably the best of the ones that we did.  When you stand at the base of this climb, you get a sense of how much work went into cleaning the route.  It is hard to believe that someone was that motivated to put this route up, but I'm glad that Richard and Pebby did.  While the route is long and enjoyable, I don't think that it is as good as some of the other routes at Avalon.  If you like remote and obscure climbs, then the Northeast face of Avalon is worth a visit.

    Thanks, Tony.  I am glad you enjoyed the route.  It was indeed a lot of work to set up as a climb.  I had considered this long narrow arete to have potential for the last 10 years.  I had run out of less arduous projects, so it was time give it a go.      This climb also marked my return to life after a bad motorcycle crash 7 weeks ago.  So I labored with a broken hand, broken rib, torn shoulder ligaments, knee surgery and a second head injury (one was clearly not enough).  But not to complain...I'm back!  Pebby was just fantastic on this route.  I could not have done it without her hard work and boundless enthusiasm.    By the way, this route has 9 bolts along its 100 feet and 2 bolts with steel rings at the top.  The crux is long and intricate.  I thought it was fun, but that's just me.  After all, there is no accounting for taste.    Richard Rossiter

    Richard,  I am not saying that you shoulde remove the bolts. There are bolts that I get ruffled over, but I don't think these qualify. They were not placed in an unreasonable way, not retros, etc.  Having been there since before the adjacent crack was climabable, I can see the arguiement to leave them unless you can see from the ground that they are gone. Since they predate the crack &amp; are expected to be there by people, removing them doesn't serve much if they are not obviously gone.   Regardless, I'm not invested in either point of view.  Perhaps this is a time when you can chalk one up to the "whoops" column and leave it, keeping a mental note about it in the future if you start on a line that apprears to have a servicable crack nearby or rather, one that could become serviceable with some cleaning.  Meanwhile, I think your civil tone, flexibility, and honest reflection on the matter is befitting a gentleman....

    Looking back on Dragon Slayer, it is true that all of the cracks on the Third Tier were pretty clogged as was the entire crag when I started working out the climbs in 1996.  But hindsight is always 20-20 and I would say now that much of my work on Avalon and Sleeping Beauty was a little "sport sighted."  Maybe next season I can return and remove some of the unnecessary bolts.
    Nov 26, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The guano is not terrible, but also not completely avoidable, so it is a detractor to an otherwise good corner.  The bolts are on the route 'Dragon Slayer' which was put up a year before Blade was cleaned and is a sport-climb from the bottom up, so I understand how they got there.  But the fact that Blade now runs right through the upper part of that route does lend one to the conclusion that perhaps the bolting on 'Dragon Slayer' was a little short-sighted.  Blade is the better route.  Consistent stemming and some really pretty cool holds solve out each crux on this climb. A few of the jams are a little pebbly, but not sharp- just a wee bit uncomfortable.
    Jun 20, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I could ignore the bat guano but not the three high bolts, each of which are less than a foot away from a crack that swallows up gear. Maybe it's cleaned up a bit and the crack didn't look protectable? Perhaps also explains why I thought it was so much easier than the first ascent party?
    Jun 20, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    My partner and I both thought that the hardest move on this was about the same difficulty as hardest move of Ancient Light pitch 1, though Blade is overall much more sustained.  Two star climbing plus add another for being in control of one's own destiny as far as protecting goes.
    Jul 8, 2007

    There are crack climbers out there who would love this consistently demanding crack line. The climb is highly physical as well as intellectually challenging. The question they should be asking themselves is: Why haven't I done Blade yet?     After revisiting this climb yesterday, it is very deserving of four stars. There are several roofs included in this line...one especially that sucks you into the corner...so beware and think it through.  Pebby Johns

    An excellent crack climb.  The step left under the first roof is airy and fun; watch out for some loose chockstones in the wide crack under the roof.  Getting into the V-slot above the second roof was the hardest move; it seemed about 5.9 by Boulder Canyon trad standards.    At the top, I lowered off two slings and two biners around a tree. The rope is likely to get caught in the finger crack at the second roof if you do this.    I sewed it up with the following pro: small and large wired nuts (#4 and #12 BD Stoppers), pink tricam, green Alien, #0.75 Camalot, #1 Camalot, 2 #2 Camalots, #3 Camalot, and #4 Camalot.

I thought the bolting was weird/off when I was leading and was really surprised to see it was a Rossiter route as his are generally bolted perfectly, still not a deal breaker.

    Good route and worth doing. Bring some small pieces if you are worried about the spacing between bolts.  IMHO, the bolting is fine. It's expensive and time consuming to put up bolts, so you really can't fault the guy for not adding bolts in areas where the climbing is moderate.

    The route has certainly cleaned up. I'd have to say that some of the grade issue may have to do w/ what Slim is talking about.    I would have to agree in part that this route isn't bolted well (especially not for a leader pushing 5.10s). Although the climbing through the first 2/3s of the route isn't all that difficult compared to the crux, there is a very real potential for ground fall from near the 2nd bolt. Not sure why the bolts were configured as such, but don't let your guard down til you've got the 2nd bolt clipped.

    The first half is moderate, but the headwall was way harder than Ancient Light which is supposedly 10a, but may be just 9. The clip after the finger crack on the headwall was pretty hard.

    Tony Bubb writes: "So is the route hard at the grade, or only for Avalon?"    I fell off the crux three times.  I found the route harder than all the other 10s I've done at Avalon, including Lust, Sex Slave, The Fool, Dominator, Marquis de Sade, Isle of the Dead, and Dead Again, all of which are rated 10b to 10d.    To Richard and Bob:  I realize how much work goes into establishing and cleaning a new route; I have thanked you both in person for all the new routes you have put up over the years.  The vast majority of those routes were fun and clean the first time I did them.  Some were a little dirty at first but have cleaned up with subsequent ascents.  I remember doing Gish on Bell Buttress and I could see the rock dust from drilling the bolt holes, and found the route fun and adequately clean even though I was doing perhaps the third or fourth ascent.  I also did The Horse, The Dead Zone, and Charon's Boat on Avalon within a week of their creation and found them fun and reasonably clean.    However, a very few routes were so dirty when I climbed them that they weren't much fun: Prince Charmer on Sleeping Beauty, Justin Alf Memorial on Bell Buttress, Mephistophiles on Solaris, and Mystery Ship on Avalon.      When a route is dirty beyond a certain point, it will not attract climber traffic and will never clean up and become popular, unless the line is so compelling that it begs to be climbed, like Dominator, or unless someone takes the time to clean it up.    I'll take Richard's suggestion and buy a wire brush and whisk broom and keep them in my climbing pack when I'm doing a recently installed route, and try to clean the route if it needs it.  I urge other climbers to do the same.  Any climbers wanting to give something to the climbing community should apply a wire brush and whisk broom to the routes I mentioned above, and any other potentially good routes that need cleaning.

    I am responding to the entries from Ron and Tony.  For most of the routes on Avalon, I graded them according to the perceived difficulty on the actual first ascent.  In some cases this has proven pretty close to current consensus.  In other cases the routes were so tenuous and unstable, such as the Dominator, it was difficult to imagine the things all squeaky clean after 1000 ascents.    Regarding the new routes on the Third Tier, I was trying to project into the future, when all the lichen and moss is worn away and all the beta is known and published.  Ron may have a point though, that it is tiresome having the initial ratings endlessly downgraded by people who do not even set routes themselves.  Time will tell if I have been too conservative on these last few routes.    As for the routes being "dirty,"  I would say this.  Most climbers have no idea how much effort, time and sheer manual labor is required to set up a single new route on a primitive and heavily [vegetated] crag such as Avalon, Sleeping Beauty or Lost Angel.  Clearing brush, loose rock and building approach trails are enormous undertakings.  Understand that I am not complaining.  I could not even explain the deep pleasure and sense of creative fulfillment this work has provided for me over the years.  I am just speaking out.    If you think a route needs to be cleaned up, here is the solution:  Go to McGuckin's or Southerlands Hardware and buy the following tools.    1. Wire brush with a closed handle (to protect your knuckles)  2. Weed puller, steel, wood grip  3. Surgical tubing, 24 inches long (to blow debris out of cracks and crannies)  4. Whisk Broom    Then go clean the mutha.  Be part of the solution or be a wanker.    Yours truly, Richard Rossiter

    Perhaps Richard has been taking into consideration the heavy down-grading that consensus has given the other area routes. I spoke about this with him a few weeks ago. Avalon is pretty soft not only relative to other areas, but also within the canyon.  We all try to arrive at consensus for an area, and this discussion promotes that. As a guidebook author, Richard is in the uniquely difficult position of not only trying to arrive the right conclusion and keep a relativly [consistent] grading scale, but also trying to set the standard for what that scale is. Once the books are published (or routes published en-mass) then that is the standard...    So, is the route hard at the grade, or only for Avalon?    On F.A. of any particular route, especially when I am cleaning along the way, I try to take all factors into consideration and guess at what grade the route may some day end up at.  The great thing about this as a living resource is that it can be updated...

    A challenging route made more difficult by plentiful moss and lichen; the route could use a good scrubbing.  The start is on a narrow ledge with a drop off; consider anchoring the belayer to the big pine tree since the first bolt is fairly high.    I found the headwall at the fourth and fifth bolts to be much harder than 10a.  I had to power layback a finger crack with small lichen-covered footholds and a long reach to the next good edge for the hands.  Maybe there's an easier way, but I couldn't find it.

    A nice, physical corner crack -- too bad it's not longer.  Two #2 Camalots and two #3 Camalots protect the widest sections well -- no need for anything larger.

    I recommend Ancient Light P1 to Ancient Fright and the Resurrection to the top.  A fun way to summit Avalon (which is really nice), but this pitch isn't great in itself.    It was a Saturday and we saw nobody all day, until we went back down near Ripcord, where there were 10 - 15 people.
    Aug 19, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The tree above the finish to Ancient Fright is gone as of October 2005.  A gigantic boulder tipped over and shattered the tree, but did not quite break it off. Thus  the boulder teetered precariously against the tree, 200 feet above the approach gully.     I came up with a tree surgeon's saw on a 10-foot fibre glass pole and cut the tree until it snapped under the weight of the boulder.  This was a hairy opperation as I had to get down even with the base of the tree to wield the saw.  This boulder was literally the size of a VW bug, but of solid granite.  It is difficult to even speculate how much it weighed.  When the boulder fell it ripped a path through the forest  below about 10 feet wide and 200 meters long...most of the way to Boulder Creek.      I felt I had to fell the tree under controlled circumstances rather than when the tree finally gave way on its own.  In any case, you can no longer belay or rappel from this tree.      FYI: I returned during the summer of 2006 and placed a 2-bolt ring anchor on the east wall of the recess beneath Resurrection (in place of the fallen tree).  Richard Rossiter

    In June 2006, Richard Rossiter added a 2-bolt anchor near the start of Resurrection. You can rappel from this anchor to the ledge at the start of Ancient Fright with a 60m rope.

    A worthwhile route to the summit of Avalon after doing Ancient Fright.  I placed gear from a yellow Alien to a #2 Camalot.  The initial crack is fun 5.7 hands.  The steep 5.9 face, protected by 2 bolts, can be made a little easier by stemming off the tree.    Belay from the top anchor and bring your partner up, then scramble another 5' up to the summit of Avalon, an airy and beautiful place.    To descend, we rappelled back to the tree at the start.  There is a rap anchor on this tree (two sling and a locking biner).  We  rappelled  from here to the start of Ancient Fright.  The 4th-class downclimb looked a little hairy, so we went over to the anchor atop Ancient Light and rappelled back to the ground from there.    If you're looking for some adventure climbing in Boulder Canyon, check the combination of Ancient Light, Ancient Fright, and Resurrection.  The summit of Avalon is a neat place to visit.    We applied a wire brush and whisk broom on our rappel descent, but the routes could still use more cleaning.

    I think the route is more like 80' or maybe less. I'm pretty sure a 50m would reach all, but I didn't try, because I don't own a 50m (short ropes are not sexy).

    I actually enjoyed War Horse more than the Art of War. Ron's gear recommendations are excellent (although a blue Alien works as well as a hybrid Alien). After the first placement just above the third bolt, the trad climbing is never harder than 9 or 9+.    However, as Mikeneu noted, some expletive deleted stole the hangers and rings from the new bolt anchor. Until they're replaced you have to: (1) belay/rap or lower from the slings and rap rings at the Thus Us tree; or (2) sling the tree for pro and climb diagonally up left to the last two bolts and anchors on the Art of War before lowering (doable with a 60m rope with a few feet to spare).

    Some neat climbing, but the route needs a good scraping so you can smear with your feet and not fall.

    This is a great pitch; one of my favorites on Avalon.  Sustained, varied climbing from bottom to top.    We geared up on a spacious ledge at the top of the ramp and scrambled down to the tree to belay.  Be sure to anchor the belayer to the tree; this spot is exposed.    The crux is the traverse left past the first bolt; thin edges for the feet make it possible.  Climb up and clip the second bolt and breathe a sigh of relief.  Solid face moves past the second and third bolts, an unusual ramp by the fourth and fifth bolts, and an overhang at the top round out a great pitch of climbing.    The rock is still a little dirty but should clean up with more traffic.  Unfortunately, we didn't have time to wire brush the route on the way down.    If you've climbed everything else on Avalon, make the trek up to the Wall of the Dragon and do this route!

    I am not sure what to think sometimes of grades. I brushed the climb down pretty well on my way up and I think that made it a little easier- it is still cleaning up. No less, Lenny and I both thought the climb was about 5.9. I think that initial ascents all feel harder to the FA party due to lack of cleanliness on the route, avoiding bad holds, and the effort put into cleaning on the way up. I figure that the grade of this climb will eventually settle into 5.9-. As for the quality, it's hard to say a whole lot about a climb less than 10 meters tall. If it were 5 times longer, you'd have a great route on your hands, I guess. Meanwhile it goes as an after-work diversion.

    A short but fun route which seemed harder than the typical Avalon 5.9.  The finger traverse between the second and third bolts is airy and it's a stretch to reach the third bolt.

    Thanks, RR, for all the work up this way, very beautiful setting. This route was probably the best of the ones I got on.    Seems pretty clean at this point, the only thing that seemed concerning was the fractured lower part of the giant, left-facing flake at mid-height; however, I can't really imagine how it could be pulled on to break it out from behind the solid flake.    I definitely agree w/ TB that if you're not feeling very solid, stick clip or lean across and climb the first section w/ the 2nd bolt clipped. It would be very unlikely to walk away unscathed if you blow the 2nd clip. I also agree that if you charge straight up from the ground it will feel a little stiff for a 10.

    What is this route rated if you do a direct start and do not use the boulder off to the side to start at the second bolt?  We did it that way and thought it was pretty hard, at least an 11.

    Note to the mp.com folks...I am offically changing the name of this route to the KNIGHT OF SWORDS (an afterthought), as it is one of several ways you can reach Dragon Slayer.  I think the sword has been the traditional weapon for slaying dragons.  Thank you and keep up the great work.  This website is not only very useful, but is a lot of fun.  By the way, climb this route straight up out of the gully and it has a new crux.

    A fun route that's well worth doing;  steep and sustained with varied moves all the way up.    I was able to clip the second bolt from the stem off the huge boulder; shorter climbers may have difficulty making the clip before committing to the wall.  I did not try the direct start, avoiding the stem off the boulder.    Avoid a loose block on the left just below the top.    My partner cleaned up the route with a wire brush and whisk broom on the way down, but the route could still use more cleaning.

    Cons: 20' long; avoiding Charon's Boat is tremendously contrived.  Pros: Every move up to the last bolt, esp. if you play the contrived game, is thought provoking; this is a rare non-overhanging climb that is probably easier if short.    I was torn between giving it one or two stars but the 2nd Pro tipped the balance to two.

    Coincidentally, it's also a gimme for 5.11.       The bolt on Charon's Boat is about 20 inches away from the bolt over the lip on this route.      The climbing on this route is kind of fun.  Too bad Charon's is such a ridiculous squeeze job. Do we really need to bolt every single piece of choss in BC?

    This is a nice, albeit short, new route.  I won't give it a rating, but I suspect it might not be a 5.12.  I am able to clip the third bolt from the undercling under the roof, a technique I recommend if you have the height.  The crimpers on the arete under the third bolt are surprisingly decent.  After I got my feet on the arete and stood up, I reached a bit off to the right on a hold that is probably also on "Charon's Boat"; these routes converge near that point, so I'm not sure if that hold is off-route or not.

    The crux is definitely above the last bolt, and moving left keeps the route 5.7.
    Jul 5, 2013

    You can also climb this thing belly to the bolts past the last clip and to the anchors without going left, which it looked like the bolt line was trying to force. Small slopers will be on the menu and it is probably 5.11b or so, done that way.

    A nice warm-up route that gets good afternoon sun.  The hardest move is getting to the anchor from the last bolt; come in from the left to keep the grade moderate.    Great views looking up the canyon from the saddle just above the start; the huge rock spanning the gully is amazing.

    Update as of 8.4.13 - climbed this route for the first time and it's still excellent.  Clean, well-protected 10a climbing in an atmospheric setting.  I was glad to get the grey Camalot after the eighth bolt and belayed from the good anchors twenty feet off the deck.  A 70m rope is recommended and gives plenty of slack in whichever configuration you climb it.

    Fun route in a nice setting.  Two stars for sure.  Didn't need any supplemental pro; the bolts seemed well placed and not too far apart.

    Did this route on 7/19/02.We belayed the traverse to the start anchor and protected the one  dicey move with a small Alien. I found the climb to be burly for Boulder Canyon 10a; it felt more like 10b at the crux by the 9th bolt. The climbing is varied and interesting; definitely a worthy  route.  I belayed my partner from a good ledge at the top anchor instead of lowering.  On rappel, we had 2 feet of rope left (with a 60-meter rope) when we hit the start anchor. A short rap from here gets you back to the ground.  Be careful to keep the rope out of the creek!

    Lillian or Smashing Pumpkins?    This is a good route, tastefully bolted and always interesting. The grade is fair enough, but deep shade and crashing creek make the experience somewhat atmospheric. Both green and yellow Aliens fit the horizontal perfectly between bolts #8 and #9.    Unfortunately, there is a big and really scary flake near the eighth bolt - you can easily recognize it by all the chalk. It is possible to avoid it on the left, but this baby really should be trundled (carefully, from above) before it kills someone.

    A climb with some good moves, but also some of the dirtiest rock in Boulder Canyon. This climb needs a good scrubbing before it will ever become popular.    The belay position at the start is precarious.  You're on a slippery vegetated slope with no anchor, and Boulder Creek roaring 15' below. If the leader falls before the first clip, both leader and belayer will fall in the creek.  A belay bolt at the start is really needed.    There's a great sequence of moves from the fourth to fifth bolts; work up left and back right for the easiest line.    After the sixth bolt, the leader is confronted with a choice: angle up left in a shallow corner with a little pine tree and lichen-covered rock that looks as if it's never been climbed (with no bolts to mark the way); or angle up right past two bolts on cleaner rock on Gish.      My partner opted for the Gish variation.  I think most climbers, not knowing where the route goes, would make the same choice. This corner also needs a thorough scrubbing and perhaps a bolt to indicate that the route really goes left at this point.    At a ledge below the final headwall, my partner spotted bolts off to the left and angled back on route.  The final headwall has a little pine tree sticking out, rock that is completely lichen covered, and some very hard moves.  The thin face above the little tree felt about 10d to 11a.    My partner belayed from a good ledge at the top and brought me up. We then rappelled with a 70m rope, which was just long enough to get all the way back to the ground without having to stop at the Gish anchor 30' off the deck.    Bob and Vaino, you guys have put up some great routes in Boulder Canyon, and we're all thankful for them.  This route, however, needs some more work before it approaches the standards of your other contributions.

    The third bolt is not hard to clip (approach it from the left), but it's in a really poor spot, and too high, and if you slipped there it could be disastrous.    The crux is tricky.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    The last (6th) bolt is very well hidden on a ramp about 15' up and slightly right after you top out above the crux.  You can't see it till you peek over the edge and you need a slightly longer draw for it so the biner is not hanging on the edge.  From this bolt, you can see the 2 bolt anchor another 12' above.    I clipped the 3rd bolt from the right, and it was not trivial to do, with a huge fall potential.  I did not bring any gear, but my buddy said there was a crack to the right that could offer protection while clipping it. I thought getting past the 3rd bolt (again starting from the right - looking at Rolofson's guide, he shows an alternate way from the left which I did not try) was solid 10.  Hint: keep moving/reaching left once you get the one good hold above where you clipped the 3rd bolt.    First ascent was Rick Leitner, 1997.

    I'm not sure how the last few moves were intended to be done.  It's tempting to move to the left side of the arete and finish there.

    Indeed. However, I did like the opening to the middle route. These routes will also seem a bit contrived to the purist, but I have often enjoyed trying to figure out just what the FA team had in mind. On a crag with brilliant climbs like Cosmosis or The Verve, these routes won't knock your socks off. But, they add some variety in a quite little spot with easy access and have some fun movement. Besides, pulling carefully on delicate rock is good experience for climbing in the mountains. In fact, and it is worth mentioning here, the little flake by the fifth clip flexed enough when I pulled on it that I suspect it will not last very long.

    I dispute the 11b rating for the crux as well.  I was able to RP the second attempt, but I'm 6'1" and think anyone much shorter would have trouble reaching the sloper.  The crux is just after clipping the last bolt.  Then you jam the left hand as far to the right as you can.  Get the left foot as high as possible and reach up and right for the sloper.  I was able to get my tips on it.  I'd tried dynoing to it on my first foray; it's too slopey for that.  Then you have to cross over with the left hand, grab the fin, and do a few burly layback moves to the top.  It's really a great move if you're tall enough.  Unfortunately, the route itself warrants few stars because the bottom 2/3 follows the lame rightward-tending dihedral.

    I am 5'11" and could not reach the sloper out to the right from the jam for the life of me.

My hamstrings did not allow me to make this stretch!).  He then somehow hung on to the sloper, adjusted his feet and then crossed thru to the fin.  Not your typical 11b! More like 12a?

    This is such a good route.  As long as you're careful getting to that first clip, the rest of the route protects beautifully.  A 1-1/2 Friend with a looong sling on the left protects the move out to the roof, then a 2 Friend just over the lip is bomber for the next few moves.  I tried a .75 Camalot and a 1 Camalot both just above the roof and neither one fit as nicely as the 2 Friend -- where I placed it also left room for the one, good, handjam.  Milk the pod-rest above the roof, then get psyched and punch it!    I think the route is .11d because of two reasons, 1.) that's what it was rated in an earlier guide, pre-sport grade inflation, and 2.) I've never climbed a .12 before, or since )-: and I was able to do this route with some strategy - definitely not the first try.

    This route is awesome and high quality.  Being a real crack and very sustained, it's uncharacteristic of the Boulder area.  I think the "s" refers to the start, where you need to do some 5.10 climbing with bad ground fall potential before getting to the first pro (a bolt) about 20 feet up or so.  But the pro from there, although pumpy to place, seems pretty good.

    Obviously, safety ratings are subjective, too, and are often hypothetical until someone (or several someones) tests it, but to me PG-13 means "safe as long as you maximize pro, but you still might take long falls," which I think describes Beethoven's exactly. That said, there's "not insignificantly difficult" climbing that is only protected by 2 equalized RPs, and below that is the ground. Sure, I believe they would've held, but it did seem kind of heads up. For sure, falling off the actual hard climbing involves air time. It's worth dealing with the gear, though, because this pitch is awesome.
    Apr 21, 2014

    I'd say this barely deserves a PG-13 rating with use of modern gear. Good, if not great, placements every 6-8 feet to protect the engaging 5.11 for the first 30'. A combination of RPs, small stoppers or C3s sew the bottom up pretty well. Upper crux protected well by small cams though a long fall is certainly possible yet safe. Can't wait to redpoint this one!

    Mossy.  Licheny.  Rotten rock.  But kind of good, if you're in an adventurous mood!  I broke a very large rock, took a good fall, and luckily didn't hurt anyone when the microwave-size block hit the trail below.  Can get down in two raps.  Second is tucked in and hard to see.

    Michalm has a rather unrealistic attitude towards sport climbs. Having to bring one piece gear to place off route &amp; left of the 5th bolt sets up a dangerous situation for many climbers who think the route will be all bolts. I do remember coming quite close to Double Jeopardy's bush infested corner on the upper section of the route. Not a pretty trad line &amp; one to avoid.     Don't assume that the FA team were just a bunch of sport climbers. We all have had extensive trad experience since the 1970s. I love sport routes, &amp; I love trad routes. Having to place one or two pieces of gear on a sport route is not what I'm into.    My guidebook says there are 6 protection bolts, not 7.

    The crux seemed to be clipping the 2nd bolt. The route would be more enjoyable if this bolt were in a more sensible position. Also, the 2nd to last bolt is 2 feet from a perfectly good #0.5 Camalot placement, so it really shouldn't be there at all. Good climbing on interesting pegmatite, but the bolting could use improvement.

    We climbed this route in the rain, perfect situation until you top out on the slab finish. Overall a fairly good route, but if Hound Dog is truly 11a, this route is easier.

    Second pitch makes this an even better outing. From a great hanging belay atop P1, it adds interesting face climbing to thought provoking dihedrals to hand crack (fixed #1 C4) to an offwidth (old #4 C4 was welcomed) and then even a short chimney move to top out! We did the walk off, I would rap next time for sure.

    Awesome route!  The pro isn't scarce, it's just really small and often shallow.  So, for unseasoned trad folk like myself, it's a bit of a heady lead.  That said the position, exposure, and moves are AWESOME!    Did this yesterday and had to leave quickly when the weather came in.  I had to leave a cam that was stuck about 1/2 way up.  Blue cam.

    Been looking to do this route for a while now.  This climb protects much better than what I have heard if you have small RPs.  I got two good nuts on the left side of the pillar.  I still didn't want to commit....  But just after the pillar slightly (where the pillar turns juggy), there is a perfect slot for a large RP.  It is a SLOTTER nut that protects the crux.  From here, you hike your foot up onto the pillar's juggy top and place a bomber #1 cam....  When you get to the top of the ramp where the route steepens, it can seem devious on how to protect the moves to get up into the steep corner and to the ultimate prize (the chalked up juggy flake).  Place another small yet bomber nut in a small slot close to the corner.... It's hard to see, but it's there. You can also place a marginal 0.4 Camalot in a slightly flaring crack....  Lieback the greasy slopers and go to an incut crimp up and left, and then latch the jug... over from there.  Hope this wasn't too much beta....

    I climbed the first pitch yesterday and did not find the piton, which I guess might have fallen off or was removed. There was a purple BD fixed nut at the crux, which I found a little scary, because if you blow it and the nut pulls, you are likely hitting the flake below you.    Overall, the route is great and, except for the crux move, protects easily and is a lot of fun.

    Done this 5 or 6 times but never the second pitch until today.  Very worthwhile!  A bit easier, but the pro is not as good.  Nice long pitch to near the top.  From there, find a rap station to the east; two raps gets you back to the trail.

    Good route.  If you have small hands, watch out...the top section becomes an off-hands, not quite fists crack.  Small gear at the bottom.

    Small wires protect the crux, however, it can be a bit heady making the move to the good finger jams above. Good gear placements throughout the entire route. Similar to Curving Crack but harder, not as sustained as West Face to the right. Rp's to a #3 camalot, concentrate on small/medium cams. The crux felt 5.10a with sections of 5.9 throughout the climb.
    Jul 4, 2008

    Love Cosmosis, lots of fun, I used a #4 stopper, after that reach up and squeeze in a #1 Camalot, clip the old angle piton, get up into more vert. climbing, place a yellow Alien, and then gun it to the anchors, (one can also get a solid #2 Camalot placement in the handcrack up top).  Yes is very nice. I rate it 5.9**** (super fun).

    Climbed this amazing route again yesterday.  One of the best pitches in Boulder Canyon.  Too bad it's not longer.  Just make sure you protect the crux move before committing to it.  A small BD micro nut works well in the lefthand seam and if you climb up high enough you can put in a really good #1 Camalot before executing the crux move.  Four star quality!
    Jun 4, 2006

    Two or three cruxes and sustained hard between them! My pro: three stoppers, a TCU, a #2 and a #3 Camalot in the upper crack and then I ran it out a bit to the anchors. This route made me think more than I'm accustomed to. That may not have come off right.....
    Oct 18, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Followed this route last year...lead it today for first time...spicey and sustained for the grade IMO. Pumpier than neighbor West Face for sure.  The black Alien fits the upper corner before the lower crux.  Placed a .75 cam above the crux and down climbed, then went back up for the clip.The move half way up, off the corner, is a high reach, sloping layback, sans pro from above...kinda sketch.  That move is equally as hard for me as the lower crux. Got a good #4 BD stopper in a chalked crack near the corner before this move.  Bring a #2 and #3 for the last 15'...

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I took a fall trying to place gear at the crux about 5 years ago (my first trad whip).  After getting my head together I realized that if you make 1 or two more moves past the crux, a good dropknee/stem can be found with your left foot on the jug you just passed, which lets you place gear pretty easily.  It's nice to know that you can get in gear at the crux, but if 5.9 is your trad limit, it will be very pumpy to place gear there.  The piece I fell on was a #3 Black Diamond nut, it held about a 12 foot fall, I weigh about 190, so the gear is pretty bomber!

    Gumbies beware: Pitch 2 (assuming 3 pitches) is really run-out 5.6.    I tried the old "I'll lead the easy pitch" routine, and got scared walking up the easy 5.6 after flailing up the P1 dihedral on TR. Perhaps I was off route, but I went left on the face as noted in this description and shown in Rossiter's photo. I got in a #1 Trango cam (1-1.5cm) about 30'+ above my first placement, which was right off the belay. It felt similar to the First Flatiron P1 run-out.    Regardless, a good fun climb.
    Jun 25, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    AMAZING!!!  Trad is where it's at.  Small RPs protect the first 20 feet well - I put two in low and equalized them and then a number 5 RP in the crack a little higher.  Right after the first crux throw in a #1 Camalot...the rest of the climb protects great with some bigger Camalots (I used a 2, 3 and 3.5). Enjoy!
    Jul 4, 2003

    Wow!  The only reason I thought about bolting "The Route That Dan Missed" was that nobody did it (too runout) or cared about it.  I've only done it twice, back when I was much braver, and thought it was fun but not too significant in the big world of hard climbing.  I will leave the route as is forever.  Thanks for your suggestions/objections.  By the way, MG and I TR'd the route once first (mainly to check rock quality), and then MG led it.
    Apr 18, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There's a fixed #2 Camalot at the top of the hand crack with black tape on the sling.  I used but did not fall on it....     Anyways, that's my excuse to also compliment this route.  Great stemming up the steep dihedral up top!  The pro at the lower crux: geez, I found three places to put pro, but all three felt pretty sketch.  Fortunately as Charles says, you can crank up to the crux, and then reverse the moves easily back down to a rest to check your mind before going for it.

    Epiphany is a prime example of an excellent gear-protected route that would have otherwise been a mediocre sport route if rap bolted to Boulder Canyon standards. The rock quality is excellent, and the gear is just where you need it and nowhere else. The hard moves are well-protected by small gear, and the easy moves require confidence and commitment.    There are several other quality routes in the canyon that could have been gear routes or trad routes with minimal bolts but were reduced to mediocrity by placing bolts next to good gear placements or by over-bolting in general. This is not one of them, thanks to the FAs.    If you don't want to bring the whole rack:    I didn't use anything larger than a purple-blue offset Mastercam, although you could place a blue-yellow offset Mastercam down low. I recommend bringing the smallest offset nut, a couple tiny stoppers, at least a small RP or two, and two purple Mastercams. All of the gear placements are solid.

    Agree that this is a fine pitch, one that I overlooked on my first few visits to this crag (the best crag in Boulder Canyon?)

    This is a really nice route, with good climbing on good rock.  Not really R, but not really Fisher-Price either.  Split the difference and call it PG-13, with good gear available but involving a bit of work.  Consistent climbing in the 10-ish range with a brief crux.

    This route is a classic and deserves more attention. Seems like it will be easier if you are tall, and good conditions really help as well. The crux section reminded me of Public Solitude in CCC but with opposite hand holds. Slopers on the right side and crimpers on the left. Clipping throughout the crux can be difficult, but long draws help in spots. The stone is amazing, and the moves are so fun.

    ---Begin rant---  At 5'6", this route felt mid-13 to me. Maybe it's a bit easier if you are a lot taller, I don't know. I'm a bit annoyed with the grade on MP, if it takes a "12d" climber "special" tricks to send, then it isn't a 12d. Sport climbing has moved far beyond 5.12, there really isn't any need to sandbag at this grade.   ---End rant---    The meat of the route is very short lived: two 1 move boulder problems (albeit with some bumping &amp; foot moves) between a bolt high up (3rd from the top) on the route, and you don't really carry pump into it. As with other routes at this crag, it's quite condition-dependent (cool &amp; dry preferred). I found a bad hand jam &amp; a right knee scum, so consider bringing your arsenal for that (not critical).

    YO, sorry if this seems underrated but both Chip and myself are old school and did not feel like it was harder than 12d (i.e. if we could do it it was not 5.13). The route was Chip's idea. When I finally did it, I lightened my load by leading it on a 9mil rope. Fun, devious crux, don't clip the last 2 bolts until after you do the crux.

    Glad to hear it.  I went at it a few times before I gave up. Thought it was over my head. Usually I can work out 5.12 moves with some effort, unless they are very thin slopers. But in this case, no, not at all.
    Jul 31, 2008

    Not only is this harder than many Boulder Canyon 13a's, it is most likely harder than EVERY Boulder Canyon 13a.  I have heard that one local, who has sent several 5.14s, thought it was mid-5.13.  Given its difficulty and severely sandbagged grade, I really wonder how many redpoints this route has actually seen.  Excellent climbing though.

    Fun route. Not very sustained, but thoroughly enjoyable climbing the whole way to the anchor. No gear larger than a #1 or 2 are needed. Feels 5.9 at worst - there are hand jams everywhere, and I have small hands. Maybe solid 5.10 if you use the heavily chalked, flat, sloping crimp rail and the ticked V14 slab foot chips down low, rather than the bomber constricted hand jams, perfectly good foot jams and gigantic ledge on the left. The bottom looks hard, but there are huge jugs as you go to start what I expected to be overhanging arm bars.    Not much actual OW involved but a great climb nonetheless.

    It's possible, though not mandatory, to place a #4 on this route. After the hard climbing, which is well-protected by singles in the hand size or smaller range, there's a perfect pod for a #4.

    This climb is pretty tough. The opening overhang has spaced hand jams with weird feet. However, once you get into the offwidth the climbing becomes easier--but getting into the thing is challenging. Look for the sidepulls on the right side of the chimney

    I lugged a #4 (Camalot) and doubles on the hand sizes, and ended up only using a single rack up to a #3.  The crack in the back of the flare varies in size enough that you don't need lots of big gear.  Rather than going up and way left to the anchors on Hound Dog, it's very easy to place a directional and step right to the anchors at the top of the new bolt route on the arete just right of Double Jeopardy (Yeah, the one with the bolts right next to the crack).  If you runner the route well, you can lower off these anchor bolts and belay from the ground.

    I led this route yesterday. First I tried right of the tree. I'm 5'8" and have long legs, and yet I was unable  (or unwilling)  to rock on to the high left sloper, while using a crumbling right-hand crimp. Starting to the left of the tree was even harder. So I started in front of the tree and made quick progress — for a few feet  — until I couldn't find another hold, and there was no pro.     The rock bulged against my helmet, and resting was difficult. I was already exposed to the ledge falling way below to the left — and the drop-off below the ledge — and was feeling like a treed puma above a pack of barking dogs. Moving down was unthinkable;  I had to move up to find pro. A long reach found a good hold and even more commitment.  I could hear the bounty hunter cocking his rifle. I moved up again and found my first placement: a #3/4 Metolius Offset TCU in a pocket. Long reaches to place a #2/3 Offset TCU and a #7 DMM Offset nut made me feel more secure. More hard cranking over a series of bulges got me to the anchors.     While I agree that most modern Bolted Canyon ratings are soft, I think this route is 5.9. My second, Mike Endicott, who is much stronger than I, volunteered that rating as he arrived at the belay. The rock quality is generally excellent and the moves interesting, so I think this route deserves more stars.

    Fantastic climb!  The first pitch of Bell Air is a nice pitch in its own right, and gets you up to this cool crack.     I'll post a few pictures of the route, but this is a hard route to photograph.  The pictures distort what the climbing is all about.  This is an overhanging, right-leaning crack that involves gymnastic climbing (i.e. not a plug-and-chug steep handcrack).  The movement reminded me of Death and Transfiguration, albeit much shorter.    The pro is a little strange until you are established in the crack, but if you look around you can keep it safe.  I was very happy to have a red metolius TCU (1.5 Fr. size) to place in a small pocket at the start of the bulge.  Doubles on .75-2 Camalots were nice.    It's not obvious what to do when the main crack peters out.  Another crack angles right, or it looks like you can rock left onto the slab.  I went right and found great climbing.  Moving right was one of the cruxes of the route, but it felt like this is where the route goes.  The slab would go, but would probably be runout, and looked covered in lichen.    2 rap bolts at the top (i.e. no rings).  This would be a hard route to set a TR on without a lot of directionals.    I cannot comprehend soloing this route.  Bad-ass.

    It is most interesting to read Alex's posting of his route. Most of it is accurate. What I find rather amusing, but also a bit disturbing, is the statement that Alex was okay with Steve chopping the route. I did talk to both Alex &amp; Jeff on several occasions about the route &amp; its removal, over the course of a year, before I decided to go toprope on it. I remember both Alex &amp; Jeff being rather upset &amp; disgruntled that their route had been removed. After toproping The Purpose, I saw no reason that the route should have been chopped.  It is a good climb that warrants the bolts &amp; doesn't infringe on the Grand Inquisitor. The Purpose doesn't provide an escape to the RP protected climbing above the 1st bolt of GI. It has always been possible to traverse right from the last bolt of GI to bail out &amp; avoid its run-out finish. I know this, because I traversed off to Gates Of Eden in 1982.    Dieckoff felt it was squeezed, &amp; he chopped the route shortly after its first ascent. Therefore, no consensus of opinions about the climb was ever allowed to be established. What gave one individual the right to decide the fate of this route &amp; others? He had certainly bolted routes in Eldorado. I was not a pioneer of significant routes in Boulder Canyon &amp; had no business playing judge, jury, &amp; executioner. Bolting new lines was a well accepted practice in Boulder Canyon in the 1990s, as it is today. While Alex calls Bell Buttress a mostly trad crag, there are a significant number of sport routes on the crag. Verve was in fact the first sport climb in the canyon. In 2000, Dieckoff felt that no more sport routes should be established on Bell Buttress. Quite a few good sport routes were established by Bob D'Antonio, Vaino Kodas, Dan Levison, Roger Moulina &amp; Matt Samet over the next 8 years.  Thankfully, the freedom to place bolts &amp; establish new routes still reigns in Boulder Canyon.    I used glue-in bolts to discourage any further removal or chopping of bolts on the route. I added what it now the 6th bolt, because it seemed silly to have to place a RP between the 4th &amp; 5th bolt. I also added the 1st bolt for two reasons. First with the idea that either someone strong could climb the route without stickclipping. Secondly, even if you do stickclip, it helps to keep the rope out of the way &amp; serves as a control bolt for the belayer (making catching falls &amp; holding a hang dogging leader easier).    Some gear (medium stoppers- #1 Camalot) is still needed for the crack finish. A beautiful route with a very hard start.

    I'm not concerned about the bolts, but I would like to know where the 12b rating comes from, must be some trickery.  Is it 12b if you do the 12a GI start and traverse in after the Purpose crux?  That seems about right.  If you start at the Gates of Eden crack and traverse slightly left into the slopers, I believe the crux to be more like V6/7 and then some 5.11 and easier climbing above.  So, more like powerful 12c?  Straight up, no traversing in from right or left, wold be cool but at least a V7 boulder problem on a rope.  Coming in from the right was fun.  BTW, there were no rings on the top bolts, so I left 2 clips up there.

    My friend Marc Gay and I did the FA of "The Route That Dan Missed" a long time ago (late '80s?).  Of course, there are no bolts on it, although the guide shows bolts.  It is 5.10 R+.  There is quite a lot of unprotected 5.9 above the initial crux.  I've thought of adding bolts recently and certainly wouldn't mind seeing it made safer.  If memory serves, it is a good pitch that makes a nice finish to Cosmosis.  If there are no objections, I will try to find the time to retro-bolt it, or I'll consider it open to anyone else so inclined.

    I did the "Route That Dan Missed" arete to the left and concur that the route is NOT bolted and is R/X and has some (*gulp*) questionable holds.    The aforementioned variation is somewhat dangerous and has a bit of objective hazard.  This would be an unwise lead for a climber who is not very solid on 5.10 (as in, couldn't skip a few questionable holds). Being up there in a state of fear/panic would be bad news all around.    That said, I wouldn't change it.

    This route is actually pretty good and takes a pretty distinct line. Good job to the FA crew on this one. I think the route's crux is a legitimate Bocan 11a and is also pretty height dependent. My girlfriend had difficulties through the crux because of her height or lack thereof. The crux face climbing is a bit devious. The upper dihedral is excellent 5.8ish climbing to a really great, mid-10 crux. All in all, this is a great gear lead and would serve as a great warm up for Arms Bizaar, The Spoils, etc. Also a #4 Camalot can be placed on route in a wider section about half-way up.

Also, non-reachy beta exists for the upper sequence.

    Agreed, the original Sven description is very funny. Here it is for the record before it gets blasted away and lost in cyberspace history:    "This is a nice climb up a clean arete on very good granite stone. It is a short route with much climbing on not so difficult moves, but the crux is a short sequence of thin holds quite on the arete. With care in looking at the Verve before starting to climb, it was not so difficult make a good flash. Climbing up to the crux near the third bolt was not too difficult so it is possible to be refreshed before starting to make the thin moves. Mostly it is important to be careful with placing the feet in order to get into good balance for the thin hands. It is a steep climb and needed a good combination of balance and finger power in the thin moves. To finish the Verve route, the climbing becomes quite easy."

    I did the second ascent of this route on June 22, 1989. I think this is one of the best routes Christian ever put up in the Boulder area. The movement and positioning are first class IMO. I concur with Taylor on the modified hold. On the edge in question you can clearly see a drill bit hole. I don't think C.G. was responsible for this. I think someone else was working on the route first and did the damage.     Attached is my beta map from 1989 that shows the hand and feet placements I used. The chiseled/drilled hold made the "mega reach" move, which is the second crux, much easier and it made it possible to match and switch hands on this hold.     I've lived in Nederland since 2003 and drive up the canyon almost every day. I always look up to see if anyone is on Verve and I have never seen another party on it. It's a great route and deserves more traffic.     Thanks Dan for replacing the bolts, and thanks to Matt and the ARI.                         C. Lantz beta map for Verve.

    Rossiter's book is a bit vague on this, but I think the way most people do it is to keep going up the crack system beyond the large flake that the guy in the photo is straddling, for a few powerful moves.  I agree with the folks above that find this to be the crux of the pitch.  When the difficulty eases, you can angle up and right to the anchor on West Face.    In the photo there is a blocky shape on the skyline to the right of where the crack becomes a v-slot in the skyline.  I angle right under this formation.

    This is definitely a slightly more committing lead than West Face.  Both climbs start at the same point, and I basically climbed the same rock for the first 10 or 15 feet or both routes.  There are a couple obvious finger locks a couple feet apart that mark the point where I committed to West Crack proper.  I thought this was the leading crux, as I placed TCUs in each lock and pulled through a few solid 5.9 moves to the next stance.  If these TCUs fail in fall, you'll probably feel it.    If I had 2 #3 Camalots on this pitch, I would have placed both of them.  But, I was able to get another piece in at the higher widish crack.  I had minor route finding issues at the top of both this route and West Face, but no big deal.

    I toproped this after leading West face again this morning.....I have to disagree that this is harder than west face (after leading west face my buddy tr'd it, then I tr'd it, lowered while setting directional for West Crack and then TR'd it right away with my pump still going, it felt no harder than west face to me)..... it would most definitely be harder to lead due to the discontinuous crack and pumpy stances for the interspersed gear placements but I felt that on toprope they were both 9+ and that West Face was actually a little more strenuous and just as sustained (I'm more comfy face climbing than pure crack).  I find it very strange that West Face is almost entirely a crack climb while West Crack is almost entirely a face climb..... both are 3 star climbs in my opinion, as is Cosmosis and I agree with Charles that the crux is the lieback move just above the chalked up flake..... still have yet to do Double jeapordy (looks crappy)... the Bell buttress marathon is my goal for one of these weekends (cept' I think I'll TR West Crack and wait until I'm solid 5.10 leader before trying to lead that one).

    There is a placement for a #0 Metolius in the crack on the right side of the fin when you are standing on the pedestal before pulling the roof.  The placement is relatively good, and it gives the leader a piece at the roof.

    The West Face contains one of the best knee bars that I've ever done on natural rock.  The knee bar is of the horizontal type.  Your left toe fits into a notch and your left knee is pushed up against a corner just below the first roof.  At this position, you can comfortably place a RP and a number 5 BD nut to protect the roof.  The knee bar provides a nice rest for a sustained old school 5.9 route.

    About ten feet up the route a shallow right facing corner starts. This corner lasts for about ten feet, at which point you are standing beneath the roof. Near the top of where the corner runs out, on the left face, a series of flakes exist. The first one I encountered was well chalked but extremely loose and I avoided using it.  After finishing the route, my friend ripped this leg-sized flake loose with very minimal effort. The scariest part about leaving this thing in place would be what would happen to the belayer directly below. So.... the route has not changed in quality or difficulty (you'd be nuts to use that flake, but the chalk indicated that lost of people had and it was only a matter of time before someone yarded on it just a little too much),  and should be cleaner, but just be aware of that spot.

    Another good strenuous route at this crag.  You can choose between bigger gear in better rock and more obstruction or smaller gear in less quality rock at the start - and this is a pretty key decision. The book says the crux is at the thin crack roof, but I thought this section was a lot easier than the start. A bit on the dirty side up higher, but not too bad. Well worth doing.

    This seemed like the best, and hardest, of the routes down on the Patio.  I would give it 2 stars.  This is a fun little crag to climb on, good shade 'til early afternoon.  No offense, and a great service putting these routes in, but the grades seemed a bit soft on all these routes.

    It might clean up more, but my partner ripped down a large flake on this climb and I broke off a foothold on Bell Bottom that actually hit her.  These climbs have been around a while but still feel fairly new.  Be careful up there, especially on the approach slab.

    Kind of a weird route. Sort of a mixed route, yet in the upper climbing bolts are literally 6 inches away from good cracks. Yet, the crux section isn't very well-protected against the rampy/ledgy stuff below. If the protection was better thought out and the route adequately cleaned (bushes, lichen, crumbly rock), this would be a 1 or 2 star route. Half star in its current state.

    I thought this was a great (albeit short) route, and I'm psyched to go back for the redpoint.  I stick-clipped #1.  There is usually a suitable stick at the base for this purpose.  The key (BETA!) for me was finding the left kneebar that allowed me to clip #2.  Without that, I get too pumped trying to clip #2.  You can rest on the kneebar for a second after clipping and proceed.

    The climbing and protection on the lower half are perfect. On the upper section, the climbing is still good, but the bolting isn't the best. Between the 5th and 6th bolt, be prepared for tenuous climbing with a post-crux pump and bad ledge fall potential below your right foot. Falling here could be really, really bad. Another detraction is sharing the anchor out right with War on Peace, which makes for a traffic jam and difficult cleaning.    If these minor issues were spruced up, this would definitely be a 3 star route, as the climbing is the best of the routes at this crag.

    Clyde got my lunch on this one (he's good at that by the way).  Couldn't figure out how to stay on the line at bolt #5 without going over into War on Peace.  Tried to stem through it, but maybe there's a way to use the referenced hip scum thing that I didn't try.  Seemed way harder than War on Peace.  Both routes are great additions to the Bocan set of routes.

    Great route albeit a bit of a squeeze job.  Killer knee bar getting over the initial roof (not the crux), had to stay disciplined not to veer left or right to the neighboring routes.  A crux at mid-height replete w/ knee and hip scum will take off the edge while looking for a little crimp to get over a slight bulge.  Slightly sporty in a couple places  as most new routes will clean up and become quite good  2 stars (12a/b).  Great addition to the Patio!

    This is another route at the patio that starts out with excellent climbing and protection and then kind of fizzles out. If the anchors were placed at the top of the dihedral, this would probably be a 2 or 3 star route. Unfortunately, you are forced to climb/traverse through munge to get to the anchor on the left hand route. You end up spending more time horsing around on this crap than climbing the good section of the dihedral.

    Interesting problem, interesting climbing, solid stone, fun stemming moves on friction pads. Watch your footing on the ledge below the anchor; this would be a nasty place to fall. Bit of a stretch for the last clip. Kudos again to the prolific Bob and Vaino.

    Be sure to do your yoga beforehand as the wide stemming in the 10+ corner was about enough to pop my stiff legs out of joint.  I had to boulder up and down the tricky crux start about 97 times before figuring it out, but I have to agree with Fred: 11b, though really fun climbing all the same.    For those who get offended by overbolting, the right-leaning corner, which looks blank from below, will hold bomber gear placements that could easily eliminate 3 or 4 bolts. Placing the pro would make it more challenging, as the gear might fill some of the fingerlocks,  but the gear would be pretty darn good. If the unneeded bolts bother you, "you shoulda done it first" and "go climb somewhere else," etc.

    Agree with ac - this should have ended just above the start. The climbing above this is absolute garbage: absolutely filthy, mungy rock, crappy climbing. The icing on the cake is having to share the anchor out right, which tries to force you to re-climb it to clean your gear. Just say no.

    If this is the route I think it is, then the first clip can be done from a right-leg kneebar, and no stick clip is required. Gear still seems like a good idea before it. The route is OK, but still needs a serious cleaning. What can I say? After doing 4 of these routes, I can't keep straight which is which except this one and only then because it needed a few placements (take your small TCU) and was so dirty.

    This route should have ended just over the lip at the 2nd bolt as a V4 bolted boulder problem.  The upper corner and face are chossy and lame.  A seemingly solid foothold collapsed under my weight in the corner sending me for a scraping fall, so look out here.    The Patio has a good collection of 1-star routes and is a great place for a quick workout.  Expect bouldery cruxes at the equivalent V grade.  War on Peace was the best of the bunch, and might deserve 2 stars.  Underbelly is the worst.  Antebellum looks quite nice, but we didn't have the right gear for that one (bring a 3.5 Camalot).

    It looks like you can clip the first three bolts on this guy without committing to the climb.  ???  This bolting style is similiar to this                        The last pitch of Charisma.  Start atop the second pitch of October Surprise and follow a line of 11 bolts up the obtuse corner.  Sustained technical climbing with great moves for the entire pitch.  Be careful of some crispy holds and friable rock.  Lower from the top, then do two rappels down October Surprise (with a 60m rope) to get back down.      .

    I led Patti Smith up this on May 16, 1975.  We climbed the easy gully/crack system below it, to get to the main ledge.  We called the crack "Acid Crack," because we, later that day,  climbed what we thought was "Acid Rock," which was in the 1972 guidebook "5.10," written by Pat Ament and Jim Erickson.  Whatever we climbed was to the right of AC and to the left of the Bihedral route.  We, as it turns out, didn't climb anywhere near "Acid Rock."

    Yesterday, Leo Paik and I embarked upon a mini-adventure, with the noble intent of finding where Acid Rock really goes.  None of it seemed familiar to me, in spite of having climbed what I THOUGHT was Acid Rock in 1975.  Turns out what I thought was Acid Rock in 1975 was likely Sun Spot, which happens to be the only route that I haven't  SINCE climbed on that whole sector to the left of the Bihedral route.      Back to yesterday:  From the base of the Bihedral route, I traversed about 120 feet to the right, placing occasional gear, along the top of a wide slab (which old-guidebook writers called a ramp).  I passed what is probably the best, most direct start, up a tongue of gray rock,  which would lead up toward a big leftish-facing 90-degree dihedral.  Instead, I continued about 20 feet farther right and up, to where I found better placements for a belay anchor, below a bulge and at the top of the wide slab.      Pitch 1:  Leo led up and right about 10 feet, placed a cam and moved left, over the bulge (5.7+),  He traversed unprotected slab about 20 feet to the bottom of the grainy, 90-degree dihedral, where he placed cam and extended it.  He continued to the top of the steepening dihedral, past loose blocks in the funky crack and belayed on a ledge, with lots of loose rock (~90 feet, 5.8+).  When I seconded, I removed the first cam and faced a cruxy move with a potentially deadly long swing down into the slab or the bulge next to it.  I contemplated climbing back down to the belay, but that wouldn't be easy, and there was also big swing potential.  So use double-rope technique, or start at the gray tongue, directly beneath the dihedral.    Pitch 2:  I contemplated escaping to the right along this ledge, because above loomed many loose features and no obvious solid pro.  After fiddling in a ball nut and tiny cams, I moved up and placed a decent 0.5 C4.  Better rock and pro led to a difficult, poorly protected exit past loose blocks, onto a ledge by a seven-foot Douglas fir (perhaps the "pine" referred to in the guidebooks; ~70 feet, 5.8+).      Pitch 3:  Leo moved left on the ledge, then angled up and right in a right-facing dihedral-ramp system, then scrambled to the top (~110 feet, 5.7).    Old guidebooks rated this route 5.6. Later guidebook writers perpetuated this rating,  probably because they paraphrased old publications without doing any field research.

    Concerning the gear on P2, both the guidebook and the description on this page seem far off the mark. Before the crux, I was able to place a good #2 Camalot, a red Alien in a finger pocket/slot (cool placement, but difficult to determine how great it was), and last but not least, a bomber #4 Camalot! These, of course, will all be below your toes while pulling the crux, but even a somewhat decent belayer should be able to keep you off the deck should you fall. After the crux, it's fun cruising with good gear to the anchor. Enjoy!

    Great route. Pitch 1 is super protectable; you can do with or without the #4, but for beginning leaders, they'll definitely find the bigger piece a nice to have.     There are two options for the belay at the top of pitch 1. The first is to make the trad anchor. I've made a couple (I'm a newer trad leader than sport), and I opted for making the trad anchor and made it work nicely, so it's definitely something that you can do without much experience. I used a red Alien, a green Alien, and a #0.75 Camalot with a few double length slings.    The second option is if no one is on the sport route that's immediately to the left of the belay station. There's a bolted sport anchor there. If you're in a rush and no one is approaching that route (it's a 5.10a second pitch of another route), you could just clip in and be done.    I did not notice the big, loose horn that Jay reported in 2008. Could be that it's not there any more, or maybe I got lucky.    Overall, the first pitch is a good, weird little climb, and the second pitch is phenomenal.

    Great gear route.  I thought both pitches were fun.  The rock is much better and more cleanly fractured on the first pitch but the climbing is more interesting on the second.    We belayed at the bolted anchor then ran it out to the good crack on the second pitch  (about 50 ft.).  It's a trade off;  you can either have sight of your leader on the second pitch or you can have a bomber anchor.  Not both.

    This climb is a good climb.  The first half left me wondering why the route is called "something of a classic" but the second half answered that question. I believe if the entire route were like the second half, that it would be a much sought-after "destination climb." The crack in the second pitch does get a little seepy after a good rain and was wet in a spot or two this past Sunday morning. The route's second half had a few spots with moves that are 'hard for 5.8' and that did not protect that well.  If you can keep your cool and not overgrip on barn-door moves, you'll be OK.  As well, this route is GREAT done as a single 60m pitch from the ground to the top. If you use longer slings (2' and 1') you can avoid rope drag.  Go for it.

    I found this climb to be very enjoyable. The second pitch esp. has a nice alpine feel.

I agree with Leo concerning the approach. L of Riviera offers a multitude of possibilities.

    This looked good from the ground so I thought I'd convince my sportclimbing kid to belay me. Both by now bored with the dinky Riviera we tromped up there. The first few feet were nice but after dragging the rope through clumps of shrubs, poision ivy, and knocking rocks onto a party doing the bolted slab below, I reached a belay rigged on loose flakes more reminnescent of the Eiger.  I didn't have a huge rack with me, it's 5.8 right! By the time I hit the crux, the only gear I could get in that odd groove was dangerously below.

    A really underappreciated route, a diamond in the rough.  A variety of approaches.  The easiest is a 4th class gully/corner system has poison ivy as you approach.  You can do a number of trad things from left of the Riviera 5.7 or one of the L routes on the Riviera (Lease Agreement/New Lease on Life/Abandonment) and angle L 200' or even a manky long traverse in from above the Riviera.  You can definitely find solid gear for 1st pitch if you look.  You can definitely find good gear before the crux on the 2nd pitch.  Trees are definitely the best anchors on top.  This is reminiscent of climbing in the Park.

    Sorry, two more thoughts: one comment about the gear at the first belay. Without small nuts and cams there would not have been a belay. I placed green and yellow Aliens behind a suspicious flake on the left, and equalized the #2 and #3 BD stoppers on the right. A wide setup but worked great with the double ropes.  Second: BEWARE OF LOOSE ROCK!!!. The top of both pitches and the belay ledge are littered with loose rocks.

    Odd comment about the gear on P2. I did this route today and found great gear. To avoid rope drag, I placed two small cams out on the face in the first 30 feet or so, also got in a bomber nut before I moved back into the crack. Through the crux I used: #4, #1, #.75 Camalots (in that order). Top is broken and loose and yes, the crux felt a little more like 5.9, but it's splitting hairs. I got a great slingshot belay off the tree and was able to sit on the edge and take in the view. Either take George's advice and go west, or resign yourself to walking all the way down to the Riviera, then on a trail back to the buttress and then scrambling back up to the ledge...not cool. Rack up at the bottom of the buttress or even the car and carry shoes. Nice climb, long waste-o-time descent.

    This is a fun route but a little spicy on the second pitch. Also, I found it hard to find a good belay anchor at the top, which is a mass of rotten flakes. I went 30 ft farther to a large tree! The latest Rossiter tells you to walk off east, but I think it works out better to go west. You can traverse east back to the base of the climb (passing right under the 12a Edge of Reality).

    The fall line for the second, lower rappel takes you off the left side of the arete. Probably better to head off sooner than later, so you don't pendulum too much, scraping your rope over the arete's edge.

    Dale Haas and I replaced the 1/4" quicklinks and 3/8" links of chain at the first belay with Fixe SS double ring hangers. The hardware was provided by the American Safe Climbing Association(ASCA - safeclimbing.org). They appreciate your support.    We also tightened up the third bolt on the first pitch(crux) which was very loose.    As an aside, Dale and I placed those original anchors on the route shortly after the FA in 2002, so they have been up there for 14 years. Because of the leaning nature of this route, nobody ever top ropes it, which means that this anchor is only used for rappel. The 3/8" links of chain through which the rope is threaded during rappel look almost new with no real signs of wear. This is yet another example of how lowering through hardware greatly increases the wear.

    I self belayed this (again) yesterday and didn't bring any trad gear. That was a mistake. There are a couple of big runouts between bolts. In particular, after the first crux is a groundfall runout on medium difficult climbing.

    Climbed both pitches today, amazing climb.  Awesome exposure, freaked me out everytime I was above pro and looked down.  I found it harder than 10a....

Quit climbing so much, cut your hair, get a job. Just kidding.

    This route is pretty good, thanks for the work.    I would not rate this as a potential classic.    The climbing is not sustained at the grade. There are loose blocks and sections of lower grade rock. Pitch 2 is short and ends abruptly in a strange spot.    Slabberific, climb it once and maybe twice.
    Feb 28, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The loose block at the end of pitch one is still there as of 10/10/2004 and is moving quite easily.  Trundling it would be a little dubious without some coordination given all the activity at the Riviera and the road below.
    Oct 12, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    One of the loose blocks George is likely referring to is a two-foot spike/tooth of rock that's about two feet to the right of the last bolt on pitch 1; it flexes quite a lot.
    Jul 11, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I didn't think it was harder than 5.9, but I wasn't on lead. My partner didn't think it was harder than 5.9 either.    Just a note: You should place some gear in the crack above the third bolt, even if the climbing to the next bolt is easy. If you don't place any gear, a fall by the second from the crux (at the third bolt) will result in a swing over the arete. This probably wouldn't be dangerous, but it would suck. You might have to lower down to get back on route.
    Jun 16, 2004

    This is a really fun route to lead in one pitch (about 170 ft.).  I am really surprised this was not climbed earlier as it is such a classic line.   A quality addition to this cliff.
    Jun 8, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Did this route last week.  While its good by BC standards, I'd hardly call it classic.  And 10a is way overrated IMHO.  The crux on the first pitch is a high step and crank from good holds on the corner.  Crux moves on the second pitch are thin and a little balancy, but not that bad.
    Apr 21, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    AC, we considered trundling the block but, besides it not being fully detached (at least we did not test it), we could not see from our position if people were coming up a side trail below or down the hill for that matter.    Not a liability I was interested in shouldering.    I figured a heads up on this site would prevent an accident and if some one else wants to trundle it let them decide to do so.    WT

    So, uh, maybe you should have removed the block.  One of us has to do it, just make sure you yell out 'rock', and throw way out from wall.  Don't know of a better time, unless you climb at 3am.

    Climbed this early yesterday amid intermitent periods of sun and snow showers.    What a great climb this is indeed.    Lose rock alert:     There is a large flake 1x3 feet to the right and up from the last bolt of the first pitch that is ready to come off.     As you reach the last bolt and you head up the easier broken section on the right, the first large handhold you reach is the top of the loose flake.    I pulled on it yesterday and it pulled out while making that grainy "rock-detaching-itself-from-the-wall-sound". I pushed it back in but it is way lose, only a matter of time...     When it comes off it is likely to fall right where your belayer is likely to be standing! Top Candidate for a trundle if you ask me.    Be Safe, WT
    Mar 29, 2004

    Did this route yesterday under light snowfall, fun route!  We used a few wires, Aliens and the #2 Camalot.  There are a couple of loose blocks that are not obvious, and probably wouldn't come off even if you yarded on them, but who knows?  Amazing that this cool route was not discovered earlier.
    Mar 29, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Unlike the above commments, I found this route to be a little tricky.  I'd agree 9+ or 10-, slab climbing isn't my forte, and maybe I was having an off day.  Nicely exposed, interesting, and I'm happy someone bolted a route leaving the places with gear for gear.  Comapred to other boulder canyon 5.9 sport routes, this one seemed to be rated more like an old trad route, i.e not a gimmie for the grade, like, for example, 'pup' on neighbooring Security Risk......

    I also thought that Rhodian Shores was a bit tougher than Bihedral Arete.  Very high quality though, and well worth the scramble up to the start.
    Aug 13, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Good route and good boting ethics (not bolting where there is gear placements).  Wish I had something bigger than a #3 TCU for the first pitch.  A #3 Camalot would have been nice between the last bolt getting up to the P1 anchors.  A few loose holds still on P1.  Best option for rappelling is to rap from the top of P2 to the anchors on the bolted face to the left of the Bihedral; makes for a clean pull and plenty of rope to get down.    Great position and solid movement above your gear.    Slabby arete moves on P2 are tricky, but all there and well protected.
    Jul 21, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Two ways to start this route, both pretty simple.  Yard directly up from below the front face to a clip 20' up or so.  Or start on the shallow inside corner, climbing up about 15' and steping over the arete to the clip. I did it from the front, my partner lead and started from the inside corner.  First pitch felt (7+)ish to me with good exposure, maybe one (8) move half way up moving off the arete.  Nice pitch of interesting climbing if you stay close to the arete.  IMO climbing in the middle or right side looked much easier and degrades the quality.  On P2 climb 20' of (6)ish to a roomy corner ledge, and the fun starts from here. Ascend off the arete onto the face using the inside of the arete, small crimpers, and a thin seam for three clips of excellent face climbing.  IMHO this felt hard 9 to me. The crux on its neighbor, Rhodian Shores, felt harder.  But I enjoyed it, and its three stars in my book.

    Climbed this on 6/8/03 and really enjoyed it.  Pulled of a bit of loose rock at start, but overall it was clean and well protected with great position.  Had the whole rock to ourselves.  I've climbed in Boulder Canyon for almost 20 years, and I have to say that this is definitely one of the best lines of this grade in the canyon.  Kudos to the 1st ascentionists.

    Nice route.  Surprising that this line didn't go up when the area was first being developed.  With a little more traffic (read: cleaning) this will surely be a sought after climb.  Great position and views.
    Jun 3, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Good route.  Note, you won't get from the P1 anchor to the ground with 50m rope.  P1 is about 130 ft.  P2 is short but slightly harder, 60 ft?  A blue or green Alien might be useful between bolts 3 &amp; 4 (tho' could be 2 &amp; 3) on P2.  New fangled hangers on many of the bolts.    Nice but agree with T. Bubb, not an instant classic.    Again, agree with T. Bubb, but my partner, Brian, thought it was 5.9.
    May 22, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The route was pretty good. I don't know that it was an instant classic, but it was worthy for sure. It was mostly 5.6 to 5.7 climbing with short sections of harder climbing, all of which were well protected. Two moves were 5.9 or harder. Jenny thought it was easy for 5.9 (suggested 5.9-) and she's a 5.10 climber, so this should be in her range of good sensitivity.There is still a few gritty holds near the base that turned loose some crystals when I shifted my feet on them, but these will clean up with time.     I think it was best done by doing it as a single pitch (11 slings on bolts, +2 nuts with slings). It seems like you can rap off of it with a 50m by rapping to the first belay, then rapping to the top of the slabby face route left of the Bihedral (Rhodian Shores) then to the ground.    The first belay anchor is placed ideally on its own merit, but its presence was preceded by the route "Crack variation" of the bihedral, a route that is admittedly not very good and almost never climbed. Still, it makes me wonder if placing the belay slightly elsewhere would have been more preserving of the lines previously there. More something to think about than it is a complaint.

    Oct 23, 2002

    Superb. Luckily the approach is complex, which might keep the riffraff away. The route climbs nicely with Ron's suggested three cams (#2 Camalot, red and yellow Aliens), but bear in mind that finger sized wires will go in all over the place, and there are even some nice spikes to sling for you purists.    Go do this route! No, stay away!
    Aug 6, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is an aesthetic and fun route with great position.  Bring a 60-meter rope; the rappel from the top of the first pitch is almost 100 feet long.  I used a red and yellow Alien and a #2 Camalot for pro on both pitches; next time I'll leave all my other pro behind.  Bring two or three runners that you can extend for some of the gear placements.  There are seven bolts on the first pitch and four bolts on the second pitch.  Both pitches had delicate face move cruxes that felt about 9+ or 10a.  I thought the climbing was a bit easier than on Gish, a new 10a route on Bell Buttress/Aquarium Wall.

    This route is awesome!  The lower part is a great slab, fun, tricky, super cool. BETA ALERT: The roof is only about 8 feet of climbing but requires some smart and tenuous/balancy moves to a stem, a bad foot, and a tough crimp.  Then spring for a big move left to a slopey jug...big, blind deadpoint.  Then re-establish your feet and reach up for a good jug, high step, and off you go.  Then a long runout to the top.

If something makes you feel like shit, well then it is kinda a big deal. And yah, I'm not in Boulder anymore, I'm actually living in Northern Sweden now, a stone's throw from Yosemite-quality granite on the sea and bigwalls galore in Northern Norway, with hardly anyone there.

I was thinking of putting an anchor in and maybe a bolt in that wide section which if I remember correctly was easy climbing but unprotectable.

    The description for the third pitch reads:    "When doing the 3rd pitch, you should belay at the 2nd belay of the Bihedral Arete."    Shouldn't this actually read:    "When doing the 3rd pitch, you should belay at the top of the first pitch of the Bihedral Arete."    The term "2nd belay" is a bit confusing.

    I should have paid closer attention to the route description.... Got up it with no gear, and it's doable that way, not that I can recommend anyone do it though. Just make sure and keep your wits about you, because a fall before clipping the first bolt or while below the second bolt could be quite bad without any gear in the crack. It's not super difficult, but it does get a bit thin.

Furthermore, the 'excitement' of a route should be more about the ability to do the moves, not the gambling aspect of each move, wondering if, or not, the holds you did settle on will crumble or not.    My experience on the routes was first standing at the bottom watching my partner closely as the grit and grains come down from the route on each move, then climbing it, brushing each hold as I went, producing the same. The grainy rock from each foot hold stuck under foot as I stepped off of the holds, putting more grit under foot one the next hold prior to that hold even shedding.    We cleaned this route to some degree, using our hands. Perhaps a concerted effort with a solid brush would clean this up much more, and perhaps all that is under that grit is more grit, and unless it sees regular traffic, it will never really be clean. Meanwhile, if I could give something 1/2 star, I'd have chosen that option. It does have potential, but for my ascent, it felt like a bomb.

    Not a bad route, but a little lichen at the botton and a little choss at the top. As well, it stays wet after a rain for quite some time, as the crack/overlap leaks water.    Can be done in 1 long pitch with a 70m and probably with a 60m at well.

    Just climbed this route today.  This is the 5th sport climb I have ever done outside of the climbing gym, and I must say rating scales are definitely different.  This was a very fun climb, and at the crux, which I would say is at the 5th-6th bolt, I believe, it took a bit of tuning out the what ifs, and fully commit, found 2 decent holds on the crux, one which looks like a loose piece of rock but is actually a good hold (for now) and was able to clip in while grabbing a small pinch to the left once you get up on the crux.  All in all, it is a good route, a bit slabby, some lay back, and a bit reachy at the crux.  Easy as pie after the crux, 2 more bolts and then the anchor bolts.  Go for it, commit, and you'll send it!

    Great route for the beginner sport climber.  More thought provoking than the other moderates in this area, with an interesting crux, for the grade.    As for the comments on loose rock - I climbed this yesterday and found a medium sized chockstone in the corner after the crux that looked about ready to go.  Considering it's the first good hand after the crux, I'd imagine it's getting pulled on a bunch....
    Sep 5, 2010

    If you avoid the corner entirely at the crux and just go directly up the face alone, the line is slightly more interesting and challenging, and is probably 5.9 that way, otherwise probably 5.8.

    The general line has been toproped by me and undoubtedly others using the Rhodian Shores anchors and/or Bihedral Arete rap anchor. I believe I did the lower half (on TR) further right using the more difficult left angling seam. As bolted, I kept trying not to use the crack on the left feeling that using that was cheating, but without it the lower half would be more difficult than the rating.

    Great route! Above the wedged chockstone I pulled on a jug only to be shocked by finding my stomach jumping out of my mouth. I yelled rock and the 20-35 lb block landed 15ft from my belayer!

    I climbed this today, and there's a loose stone wedged in a V-crack about 2/3 of the way up the route (pretty much right at the crux).

Maybe someone should remove it? It's fairly small but could cause some damage to a belayer below, particularly one without a helmet if it breaks off.

    I found this route a lot of fun.  Very varied compared to all the other slab routes nearby.  A little spicey with bad landing if you don't use any cams.      That big loose block by the 7th clip is still there.  It made a grinding sound when I unknowingly pulled on it.
    Apr 17, 2014

    Seems like all of the loose blocks are still there. The 15x12-inch block wedged like a chockstone may actually help keep the much bigger one on its right from collapsing to the left. Maybe better to leave it. Just above, the next-to-last (7th?) bolt is placed in a big block that vibrated when I pounded on it with my hand. Alpine training or Russian roulette?

    The loose block is a detractor. That thing is more than big enough to kill a belayer or several people on the lower left crag.  It would pinball down the corner right to the belayer too- so death is not some remote possibility, it is real.  This should be cleaned in a controlled fasion with a verified CLEAR lower tier.  Otherwise, the route is long and varied, and so not bad.

    I also agree with the previous post's about the large rock right below bolt #7 at the crux. It was very loose when I arrived at the crux and I stopped the climb because of it. It needs to be cleared off safely by strapping it and lowering it down. Being that it is right at the crux, I would not climb this route till it is taken care of properly.

    Good fun route with some nice exposure. There is definitely some loose rock. I nearly pulled off a chicken head while climbing it near the second bolt.

    Beware some loose rock in the crack near the crux block towards the top.  It shouldn't be a problem, just be mindful of what you pull on (as you should always...).

No problem; bring some gear if it makes you feel better, or just keep your wits about you as you make easy moves to the next bolt.

    I believe Rossiter's rating was taken from feedback from my partner and me.  Our 5.9 rating was relative to traditional 5.9 climbs in BC; we weren't familiar with the new rating system back then.  Good alternative first pitch to the bihedral.  I did Over the Hill (real 10b) a few weeks after this route--OTH felt MUCH harder.  So 5.9 is probably accurate.

    The crux for me was getting up to and past the third bolt.  I also ended up stepping a bit up and to the right to make the third clip, but, as mentioned above, doing so makes for a difficult traverse back.  Very solid and continuous climbing.  I remember only eight bolts to the anchors.
    Aug 13, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Definitely the crux is the 4th clip, involving a thin finger tip seam about eye level and a sequence of delicate foot placements out left, working up and left to a nice ledge and much better stances.  Have the draw in your mouth ready to clip.  Two very small openings in the seam favor skinny finger tips.  Felt (10) to me. The upper half is also interesting with an undercling and a flake with more positive holds.  Fun stuff. 3 Stars.

    Good line on great rock.  I agree on the 10a rating.  We linked this with the 2nd pitch of the Bihedral route--very nice.  A few things:  I would suggest climbing past the anchors (about another 15-20ft) to the base of the the 2nd pitch to set your belay--much more comfortable and easier to manage your rope.  Second thing-leave the nuts and Aliens on the ground; the second pitch is all about .75"-4" cams.  If you don't have a 3.5" or a 4" cam, you're in for a dicey runout.  Last thing-there are good slings on a tree at the top that you can rap off.  Really fun combination--it might just have been good timing, but despite the crowds on the Riviera below, nobody was up there.
    Jul 1, 2002

    I'd say 10a around the third bolt.  I stepped right thinking the vertical seams might provide some solace but made for a tricky return back left.  The rest felt 5.9.  A great climb!

</blockquote><blockquote>
    This was a great route, albeit harder than the 5.9 rating it was given by Rossiter. I'd agree with 10a. Requires very good footwork and slab climbing techniques. One of the better sport routes I've done in the canyon.

    I also thought this route 5.10- in one section (3rd bolt or so?).  I enjoyed the route as well as the Bihedral, I would not say the Bihedral is much worse.  It is just trad climbing vs. sport.
    Aug 2, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I thought it was a great route - at least, much better than Bihedral to the right of it, which seemed like a sandbag on both pitches with poor gear on the second pitch. It felt maybe a bit harder than 9 on a couple of moves, but the rating is probably accurate for a slab.

Mark Gay beta-flashed it after watching Jon Sargeant on it (who also did not on-sight).    I think 11d is fair, but it's just going to be a booger to on-sight.  If pre inspected or "sprayed" down fully before giving it a go, it would not be so bad. That's why I personally gave it 11d.  It's all there, but it is a booger to read right out of the gate.    If you give it 5.12, then what's going to happen is people will do a few laps, read point and downgrade it.  Perhaps you can safely rate this thing when we can get all climbers to agree if grades are redpoint or on-sight oriented?!?!?

    I think 11+ is fair - it's just a tricky, technical one. And as we all know, 11+ is usually harder than most 5.12a's anyway....
    Jun 10, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    So, if all these 5.12 climbers are failing to on-sight it, should the rating be raised?? I guess Bob &amp; I originally rated it 5.11c/d, and everyone else has rated it higher. If we had rated it 5.12, would everyone concur?

    This route is a whole lot of good for 35 feet of climbing!  It's all there, but it's got to be hard to onsight.... I popped off of a heel hook while clipping bolt #4 and fell almost to the belay.  It was/is a pretty safe, clean fall from anywhere on the route once the first bolt is clipped, even with slack pulled.    Nice work on finding an improbable line that adds value to the wall.    I chatted with Greg about this one briefly.  Which lead both of us to wonder.... Has ANYONE onsighted this thing yet?

    Four star climbing, but 50' is a very generous estimate of its length.  Crux is at the 3rd bolt, though there is not a single gimme move; its continuousness reminded me of High Test at Sport Park.  The grade seemed tough for an onsight, but not too bad for a redpoint.

    Another fun moderate for this area.  I agree with the above comments - there's really only a few 5.8 parts.  I placed two cams in the crack for peace of mind, but the climbing was very easy at that point.

    Definitely one of my favorite routes on the wall. Great gear and good moves...plus as mentioned above you can also keep climbing up through the overhanging roof above and end up on What's Wrong With Parents anchors. Makes for a more direct and exciting finish. Maybe 5.9 through the roof?

    Repeated this route at the end of the day today. Posting again to draw attention to this little known sub-area of Bihedral. These routes are fun, get lots of sun, and, a rarity these days, are minimally bolted. I  like it. This time, the second crux of Calling all Trad-Climbers felt pretty easy, although definitely intimidating. One layback move onto a high step to reach the jug.

    This is a fun route with THREE strenuous cruxes, if you climb the final roof at the obvious crack. It's about the same difficulty as the other cruxes and is easier than it looks. I thought the lower cruxes were harder than they looked. You'll want a #3/blue Camalot for the roof and a few more medium cams to back it up and to protect the second above the roof. Above the roof, angle right to the anchors for What's Wrong With Parents. You may be able to lower from those bolts, but I had too much rope drag to lower.    This climb felt way harder than Don't Ask (just to the left) and Bihdedral Arete. If those are 10a, I'd call this 10b. I thought this was the best of the three adjacent climbs, Don't Ask, Calling All Trad Climbers, and What's Wrong With Parents, although we almost didn't climb it, because it looked trivial from the ground.

    This is a fun route with two strenuous cruxes.  I felt both cruxes were harder than 10a; perhaps 10b to 10c.  These cruxes were harder than Bihedral Arete (10a), Gish (10a), and perhaps harder than Don't Ask (10b).  My partner flashed Bihedral Arete and Don't Ask, and hung several times at both cruxes on this pitch.  The first crux at the bolt involves a step left and then a hard crank past a steep headwall.  There's a key handhold out left to supplement the marginal handholds directly above the headwall. The second crux is a committing overhanging finger crack.  Save a yellow and green Alien for pro here.  Make sure your belayer keeps all the slack out of the system or you could hit a ledge below the finger crack if you peel from the top of the crux. Power layback up the finger crack, then make a strenuous move up and right to another good crack.  A stem with the left foot and a wicked abs crunch were required to make the reach.  Shorter people may have to dyno this move.  Continue up to a roof (I placed a #1 Camalot under the roof as a directional anchor), then angle left and up to the anchors atop Don't Ask. I belayed my partner from the top anchors instead of lowering.  Pro up to a #2 Camalot.

    If swinging from one crack system to another by a jug constituted .10a, then the given rating may be justified. As it is though, this climb is ridiculously easy for the grade listed. Having just finished Bihedral before jumping on this, I found both climbs to feel similar in difficulty. It may be harder if your shorter, but if you're 5'10" or over and can do a pull up, you're good to go!    While the bottom half wasn't that great, the top half was pretty fun, and I'll give it a star for that.

    This climb felt very easy. After doing it (without knowing what what climb we had done), we thought it might be 5.9. There are certainly lots of trad 9s that are harder. I'm not so familiar with sport ratings, but in any case, this is way easier than Calling All Trad Climbers, which is rated 10a on this site.    I like the fact that the climbs on this wall are "mixed", with bolts only where they are useful (although What's Wrong With Parents could, perhaps, be done with only one bolt at the higher crux).

    An ok route, but the bolt at the crux would be better located if it was to the right a bit.  At its current location, you are looking at swinging fall into a slight offset.  Probably wouldn't kill you but probably not fun either.    Given the bolt location, I thought it went straight up, but the holds run out and you end up looking at a bulging, smooth mantel well above the bolt.  Ended up down climbing and going to the right in a fairly pumped state, which felt kind of exciting for some reason.

    History of "The Unknown sport climb" on the lower tier in Boulder Canyon: Was putup Pebby Johns and myself in the Fall of 2001. There used to be a sizable rock on the lower part that formed a nice overhang but that fell off a few years back. It was originally protected there with a couple wires.  I placed the rap rings to the right because we we also set it up so one could top rope the route to the right (Leave no Trace) which I think Moe Hershoff and others placed some bolts later on. We called the Unknown sport route "Botonga" and the other left unnamed at the time after toproping it and thinking it to be around 11a-11b.  -Bill Morris

This crack safely takes plenty of medium and small pro.  This route and March Madness felt easier to us than what some others have indicated, thus Leo's "gravity takes a break" comments.

    I thought this was true to its 10c rating.  I agree with Tony that it is not as hard as some of the Eldo 10cs, but for Boulder Canyon, I think it is rated about right.  The crux is really short, but it is a fairly difficult move.

    Of the routes on this lower right wall of Bihedral, I enjoyed this the most despite the somewhat chossy rock. It climbed like a trad climb and felt a bit airy. We traversed left to the Tinnitus anchors rather than scrambling way up right to the Release the Kraaken anchors.

    Some pretty good climbing in the middle but a little less great up high and down low.  Also, the grade is pretty high considering.  It felt 5.9 or maybe 10a.  I can't give it 10c for sure, because my benchmarks are Tagger, Grandmother's Challenge, Outer Space, etc....

    I didn't find the crimp to the right the first time and pinched the arete from the left side then slapped for the opposition side-pull.  This is very insecure and the feet are crap- the next handholds WORSE.  Probably 5.12.    Looked down from the next bolt on the easier part and saw the holds to the right.  Rapped and lead it again using this- more like 10d. I've been inclined to downgrade a lot of the routes here, but this one holds 10d.
    Apr 28, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Ron,  It did seem hard, but I never know how to rate things.  After clipping the big (1/2")bolt, you can reach (blindly) around the right arete for a crimp. Then get the left on a crimp. Then move the feet and reach the right hand to the top of the flake. Then match the left just below it and reach right into the corner, then right up to a good horizontal. Your body gets around the right side of the arete, but you are not that far from the bolt.

    Super runout after the 4th bolt. Don't do this without added pro unless you're leading 5.10+. The move to the anchor is awkward on the left and right, and if you fall, it's ohhh about a 40 footer onto slab. Bring small cams and nuts, there are gear placement opportunities.

    Definitely bring gear for the second half of this.  A set of small to medium nuts will work, but TCUs or Aliens would be easier to place.  I only used one small nut but would have placed another if I could of found another slot.  However, I saw a few good TCU placements in the #2-4 range.  The only cam I racked was a BD #0.75, and it did not fit in anything.  There is ground fall potential with about 15ft of climbing left to the anchor.  The climbing is easy as mentioned on other comments, but I would of been stressing it without gear.  I thought the route was fun with sporty layback moves on nice flakes at the bottom four bolts (5.8), then a bit more slabby at the top (5.5-7).  There is quartz in the granite for the first 20 feet which makes it a lot more slippery than the rest of the crag.  No stars in D'Antonio's book, but pay no attention to that. It is definitely worth climbing!

    The hanger and nut are missing from the first bolt.  It looks like a 10mm SS wedge bolt (takes a 10x1.5 SS nut).  I would replace it, but I am flying back to California tomorrow.    Until the hanger gets replaced, you can clip the first bolt on the route to the left.

    Went up this thinking it was pure sport...it's not. First 4 bolts are pretty low on the route and close together then after that it is runout for about 40ft to the anchors.

    This route is fun but rather short.  I felt it was a bit harder than Topless Etiquette.  The four bolts are probably only 10 feet apart (total), then there is a runout of 30' or so to the anchors.  The top part is easier, but you would probably hit the ground if you slipped.  For peace of mind I'd recommend a few Aliens (I used a yellow Alien).

    This route is called 'Abandonment' and is rated 5.8. You can continue up from the 4th bolt to a higher anchor (bring gear if a new leader) or follow the quartz dike up and left to the anchors shared with previous route. Either way a decent route on easy rock.

    Two things I noticed about this route. 1. It would easily go with gear for the competent 5.8 leader, 2. At least one very suspicious pocket on the route. Does anyone know about this pocket?

    I didn't read the route beta therefore had a hard time deciding which way to go. I traversed left to the last bolt on "Minstrel". Worked good for me.
    Nov 16, 2016

    Climbed this 03/22/15...finished to left per option 2. I opted out of using the bolt. Instead, plugged a yellow TCU at top of corner (maybe 10' shy of option 1 chains) just right/below the roof then made traverse at base of roof block (2 moves thin fingers and small ledge/smear feet, then a short jug haul to the chains)...definitely added some spice with the runout and possibility of a pendulum back into the corner below. IMO traverse felt like easy 9, but might give it an R for the fall.
    Mar 23, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Very different, in a good way, from the rest of The Riviera.  Great stemming up the dihedral with good gear and easy placement stances.  I used 3 TCUs from #2-4, 5 medium nuts, and a BD #0.75.  My buddy climbed it only placing nuts, but I would not recommend that.  I traversed right to the anchors above Devin's Dihedral but will come back and take the harder finish straight up to the anchors for the two 5.11s to the left.  Looked like there was OK gear there and definitely good holds up to the ledge. As Hiro ^^^ said, there is a small pocket that takes a #3 TCU if you choose to go right across the traverse.  It is not a great placement but gives you a little comfort as you side step across the easy ledge.
    Mar 10, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Fun climb, fun moves to expose your sport climbers to.  You can finger and hand jam in some places if desired.    Instead of having a follower, I set it as a TR, with a directional over the main part of the climb and then some pieces on the traverse.  Found a pocket to put a #3 in just before the traverse.  TRs need to walk back  over to reclip pieces for next climber - it is easy terrain at the top to do this.  I'm describing the up and right option here.  A 60m rope handles this setup just fine - this puts the belay far right of the start, under the anchor.
    May 23, 2013

    Fun moves near the bottom. There is a perma-cam at the bottom of the route that feels like it would hold an elephant. first 6-7 moves are the crux which consists of stemming and body shimmering. gets easier as you go up. gets a little runout at the top.
    Jul 19, 2012

    Another option is to climb up to the right, place the #2 Camalot on a double-length sling then down-climb a bit and do the traverse left to the anchors above Minstrel.  Good edges for the feet, but a bit balance-y and difficult/impossible to protect the second on the traverse.  Felt like 7+ or 8 for a move or two done this way (BoCan grades; 5.6 in Eldo ;^).
    Apr 11, 2010

    Nice route though I'm not sure I'd call it a solid 5.8.  Maybe the top part.  Unfortunately, I got suckered into continuing up the dihedral to the roof and then traversing left to a bolt.  Gear is pretty thin up there and it was mighty dicey.  Still a nice route with easy access to the anchors for Sea Breeze and The Minstrel.  I'd definitely do it again.

    I brought my gear so I could avoid the lines on a weekend.  Nobody on this route for some reason.  Couldn't figure it out.  I chose to finish left on the face climbing.  You can get a couple decent stopper placements below the face climbing, but sport climbers may find it too run out.  The climbing really isn't very hard from the last stopper placement to the bolt on the face, so I wasn't worried about a big fall.

    Better than advertised.  I think that Percious may not have gotten his route right given the 10d rating and the manufactured hold comment.  A couple of cams for the bottom and the crack after the 1st bolt make this a little less sporty.

    I found that a few Aliens (green and yellow is what I used) kept this a little safer.  There is a tricky move after the first bolt before you can get the 2" cam in.  The yellow Alien protected this nicely.  The mantle up to the second bolt is pretty tricky.  The climbing after this is interesting enough, but the bolt job is pretty poor.  They're all good bolts, and they're plenty close, but their placement is pretty random.    I didn't notice the manufactured holds, but I wasn't looking that close.  Wouldn't surprise me.

    This is fun, tricky, and thoughtful for a few moves, especially trying to mantle onto that first ledge. Yes, it is a bit crammed in, but it does not deserve the "Bomb" rating.

    Hmmm.  I went straight up the right side, not knowing what route was what until after I'd done them.  I placed a few tricams in the crack on the arete between the first and second bolts to do this route, and was glad to have them for what I perceived to be the crux.
    May 1, 2002

    For those who can't make it up Silver Glide (that's me), this is actually quite a good route. While the book shows the route going around the arete to get to the second bolt, it's possible to go straight up the lower face and do a nice and rather balancy mantle off the obvious shelf.

    Climbed this today. Really fun route. I found the start to be the hardest part, but I did the 5.9 variation at the roof.

    A good climb though found it a bit confusing in knowing what the intent of the exact line is. The move at the fourth bolt is definitely 5.10 something if you don't use the crack. There is a small 2 finger pocket for your left hand to help you over the bulge but your all the holds for your left foot seem to be slanted in the wrong direction just when u need them. If you work your way up high on the bulge and reach for a second into the crack with your left hand, the move becomes much easier.
    Nov 23, 2003

    I don't like this type of route because it feels contrived to follow the bolt line.  If you stay right of the bolts, it's probably not even 5.9, but following them seemed harder than 5.9.  An orange Alien can be slotted above the roof, or you can make some easy moves and clip the final bolt.

    After the crux this is a little runout, but the section that's runout it only about 5.5, if that. I liked this climb, slabby roof sections that have a mini-Yosemite feeling to them.

    Did it today with 4 bolts and a 3 bolt anchor. Don't think it's necessary to use all three as they all seemed sturdy to me.

    WARNING: Loose Anchors!!    First and foremost, both anchors at the top of this route are loose and spinning a bit. I am no expert, but I'm pretty sure that's not good. Are there people that monitor routes around here? I'm just starting to get outside, so I don't really know what to do besides report the loose anchors...    Anyhow, as someone who is a moderate sport leader (5.9 ish) and just beginning to lead Trad, I thought this was a great route to practice placing gear on. I placed a Wild Country Rock #7 and a 0.5 Tricam (finger size pro) on two different cracks above the 2nd bolt. The cracks are not very far away from the 2nd bolt, so I fell on my gear (on purpose) in order to evaluate my placements better. I would not be a big fan of the runout between the 2nd and 3rd bolts if I did not have pro. Then again, I am a beginner.    -ajs

    A fun route.  If you are uncomfortable with the runout a couple of smaller cams should be adequate for the nice crack (which u can't see from the base).

    As a side to my comment above: I am still a beginning trad leader, so despite the bolts and level of climbing, I still have issues with protecting my climb.  I do this for two reasons: 1) I want to make sure I am secure, and 2) I like practicing gear placements while on an easier route.

The gear I used: 0.4 C4, #7 DMM offset nut, 0.3/0.4 X4 offset, 0.1/0.2 X4 offset, 0.1 X4,  and 0.75 C4.    The 0.1 X4 was placed at bolt height, in a crystal pod, around the right arete. Instead of the 0.1 X4, I wish I had another 0.1/0.2 X4 offset or TCU. This placement was difficult to clean.  If you feel great about your gear, skip the bolt. If not, don't be a fool, just clip it.

    This route can be zipped up with a blue/purple MC, a #0.75 C4 out left and the bolt. Best route at the crag.

    To easily top rope this without doing the sketchy lead and if you can't climb 5.10 (the climb to the right that shares the same anchor) is to do Bosch Blanket trailing a second rope, clip into the anchors of Bosch and continue leading a few more feet over to the next anchor to your left (easy traverse, but don't fall because of course potential for a little swing). Clip in again of course to that anchor as you set up the top rope and then go back to the first anchors and lower.    Maybe this is obvious but just for your info.    Eeks, it was ten years ago when I first commented on this route.

    More gear beta: there is a small horizontal nut placement around the rounded (right) corner just before the last committing moves out of the dihedral.
    Oct 22, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I found this climb to be varied and thought provoking, bolt or not.  Definitely bring some small cams along, maybe a couple of green c3s (save one for after the bolt).  I decided from the ground to decide whether to clip the bolt when I got there.  Due to the flaring nature of the crack, protection was somewhat dubious and quite a bit down from the bolt, which meant I thought better to clip the bolt and wuss out than break my legs in a nasty fall (or worse!).  I encourage you to make the same evaluation and climb it in whatever manner makes you happiest.   I will say that every person that seconded this route after me raved about it, and that the bolt did make for a good directional to keep them safe.  IMO, best route at the crag.

    Fun and safe with the bolt, but I wouldn't recommend it to a budding 5.9 trad leader.
    Oct 20, 2008

    Personally I thought it was a fun route and one of the better routes at the crag. Thoughtful moves required and extra spicy for the leader. Even more fun in 40 degree weather with numb fingers. Not to be missed if at the crag. Rossiter gives this route a star and a 5.9+ rating.
    Nov 23, 2003

    There's a microcam in a tiny horizontal around to the right of the rounded arete before you get to the bolt. I remember being gripped just getting to the bolt.
    Nov 4, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I did it without the bolt and you are right, it is more interesting. I carried a handful of RPs and offsets and still didn't get a good piece in until after the crux. It's more or less a S/VS 5.9 climb.  My previous comment was made without the knowledge that the retrobolting was by permission fo the FA party (whomever you are), although I don't necessarily endorse it. The info that the FA party was in consent came from an anonymous source here...So who did the FA?

</blockquote><blockquote>
    History: I was pointed to this by Richard Rossiter a good while back. I did the first lead sans bolt with Steve Ilg as my second. Try it sometime without the bolt, which was added with my permission by Jon Grayson, it is even more thoughtful. The route was originally named Devin's Dihedral. I have no idea why it was renamed.
    Nov 3, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a great climb on great rock. It's too short, but it's far from being a one-move wonder. The moves, like the gear placements, require some thought. Also, both the moves and the gear can feel a little insecure. However the stances are good enough that you have plenty of time to think through your gear placements and moves, so it feels pretty safe.    I used only small stoppers through the crux, as I didn't see anywhere to get in a cam. Maybe a micro cam in the dihedral - but I don't have any.

    I liked this climb.  It's possible to layback part of the dihedral, both feet on right wall, fingers in seam/crack.  When the seam runs out you can move out right on sketchy friction.

    It's short, but somewhat fun. I'd tell people it was fun and if they got somehow stranded at this bolt-infested crag that it is worth the bother.  1-star, and a lot better than many of the other routes there.  Too bad it was retro-bolted.
    May 1, 2002

    Deserves a star.  It is oddly reminscent of the 2nd pitch of Where Eagles Dare.  Offset cams are not required.  It is not R rated with the bolt.
    Mar 22, 2002

    I agree with the comment above. Though short, the balancy crux was fun and exciting. I was able to place a #1 and #2 Camalot on long slings before the lone bolt, then ran it out to the anchors on fairly easy rock. Rossiter rates it a 9+.
    Jan 1, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I have to agree with Matt. I really enjoyed this route, having done many of the routes at the Riviera. It also offers the best placement for the yellow/red offset Alien Ive gotten yet! Remember, you're not in Eldo here, the climbs are short, but this was classic Canyon stemming and slab moves in my opinion.
    Jan 1, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I thought this was a quite fun route....5.6 climbing with very thoughtful pro (use slings) to a steep and slick dihedral with a seam (no pro) and a perfect bolt on the left wall to protect this balancy crux. Above the bolt is sustained 5.8 climbing for ~15 feet until a perfect Alien placement...eases off to 2 bolt belay. This exciting and fun pitch.

    Left Mussy hook has been replaced (not by me).    The challenge of this route for me came on the slab section just over the first bolt, but I'm also not that great at slab. I enjoyed the route but didn't find it to be very sustained. Once you nail the first two bolts, you're done.

    The left mussy hook is definitely compromised. Its clip flips right up past the hook. Not much of an issue if you are rapping or TRing, but if anyone is moving left to the next anchors, it seems very possible that the rope would slip out of that left hook.

    First big move to the bolt is legit on lead. You gotta commit to goin left and up to the jug.    5.10+ on lead because of the first move. If you miss the jug and fall from a blown foot, you're deckin' really hard. 5.9- if you top rope it.
    Jun 26, 2016

    There's a hidden hold that's BOMBER maybe 3 feet to left and above the 1st bolt. The trick is to find it.
    Nov 24, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Climbed this on 1st attempt today. Key for shorter folks (I'm 5'9') is to get your feet up high so you can grab the great jug hold to the left. Once I got that hold, it was pretty easy to pull the roof.  I struggled with this climb last time I was here, because the hold is a bit hard to reach, but it was pretty easy today.   5.9 for the roof and some tricky slab above.    Great fun!
    Sep 27, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    First 15-20 feet is  really fun. A bit reachy for shorter folks (I'm 5'9"). My son is 6'2" and was able to climb it with a lot less difficulty (and fewer moves).    1st bolt is a little high  &amp; placing a piece of pro lower is a good idea (for reason in post above) unless you are confident you won't fall (or stick clip the bolt).     5.9+ for short folks, in my opinion.
    Jul 26, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Hardest moves are getting off the ground. A wet start and confusion as to which route we were actually on made the crux a little harder than necessary. Probably 5.9 if you climb it right. Pro at the start is recommended if only to keep you from taking your partner down the hill if you fall....
    Apr 23, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There is some really nice holds at the first clip with one of the harder moves of the route getting to them. If you just stem and find the good feet, it shouldn't be a problem without some additional gear. There is another crimpy crux move later on that is well protected but definitely goes along with the rating in my opinion.     One of the better protected routes on the crag for someone without a trad rack. If you can make the first bolt, then the rest of it is doable without a rack. Don't think the wasp nest made it through the winter.

    Make sure you don't think this is Chouette, which is not in the Boulder Canyon guide. I managed to convince myself that it was. Oops.     One could just go for the first bolt without placing gear behind the (awkward) left-facing crack, as suggested, just don't fall -- it will be uncomfortable, and the start is technical. A small cam makes this start less scary.    Also, I didn't place a second cam above the 2nd bolt, and felt safe, whatever that's worth. The first 20' is 5.9, the remainder is 5.5-5.7.
    Jul 15, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If you're short this could be 5.9 and a spicy first clip (we didn't bother with a cam), but if you're 5'10"+, just stem and use your feet and it's pretty easy to get to the jug out left. I practically had a no hands stance below the reach.

    I think the wide disparity on grading for this climb is due to how it is climbed. If you do not move left or right it is hard. The more you wander, the easier it gets.

    5.10a for this route in the Boulder Canyon guide is presumably a misprint, as this is much harder other 10a routes in this area - there are several Pex Hill 5c moves between bolts 2 &amp; 3!

    Dale Haas and I replaced the four bolts on this climb with 3/8" SS Powers Power-Bolts (AKA 5-piece). Most people only clip the first three bolts when doing this route. The fourth bolt is about 20 feet up and slightly left of the anchor shared by Chouette and Splash.    The hardware for this project was provided by the American Safe Climbing Association(ASCA - safeclimbing.org). They appreciate your support.

    A little surface rust, but the bolts are still good. The route is harder than the guidebook suggested. Maybe, the bolting and the grade 10a was right in 1987.

    How rusted is "very rusted"?  Some pics would help.  I've replaced quite a few bolts &amp; hangers lately and although they were rusted on the surface, the underside of the wedge bolt nut, or Rawl bolt were just fine.

    Climbed this route the other week. All bolts are very rusted (bolts, hangers are fine). I placed a single set of Aliens on the climb to mitigate the danger of a bolt failing. Hope someone replaces them sooner or later.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Awesome route, one of the best at the Riviera! Be wary of the guidebook description though, "5.10a bolts and a few small pieces" leaves out quite a few details. The route is very run out in places, but this is over easy rock and makes the climb quite fun. The harder spots (more like 10b/c) are well protected. Why can't there be more like this in Boulder Canyon?? Had to laugh after looking over from the second bolt and seeing the guy on the next route over clipping bolt #6....    Load up the small gear for this climb, I didn't use anything larger than a yellow Alien and found a small brassie to be oh so nice when otherwise facing a possible groundfall clipping the second bolt. Enjoy!!
    Apr 21, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I think it's worth noting that the protection bolts are showing some wear. All three had significant rust, and the first had a loose hanger. You can top rope this route after climbing the 5.8 route to the left using the third bolt as a directional.
    Jun 14, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Not the best route at the Riv. The latest guidebook downgrades it to 10a. Glad to see the majority agree this climb is 10b/c, maybe even d at the final bolt. 10a moves at the first bolt, then runout, easy to the second. I got in a couple of small pieces to protect the step out to reach the second bolt, then it's sustained 5 or 6 moves up to and past 3rd bolt. Tough clip hanging off a right hand crimp. Runout to the anchors was no problem.
    Jun 18, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The thin moves from the 2nd to 3rd bolt definitely make this a great 10b.  Top roping from the anchors gives these crux moves a bit of a fun pendulum swing potential.
    Jul 7, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Best climb on the wall IMO.  Bolts and gear are where you need them.  Small TCUs will get you to the first bolt. I placed an RP off left before getting to the 2nd bolt, and I placed a #2 Camalot as a directional for my second above the last bolt.  10b felt correct.
    Oct 20, 2008

    Fun route that definitely keeps you on your toes.  Compared to TE, it looks way runout, but it is true the bolts are just where you need 'em.  Leo's advice on gear is good, I managed to place 2 stoppers, 2 Aliens and the #1 Camalot (after the last bolt).  The only place that is runout is after the first bolt, but it is surprisingly easy there.
    Oct 28, 2003

    This is a great route.  A few Aliens and a #1 Camalot make it quite reasonable for the competent leader.  One of the best routes of its grade in the canyon.  Footwork is key.
    Mar 5, 2002

    This route is not over-bolted like the rest of the routes at this area which makes it much more exciting.  The bolts are at the places where they are needed.  Someone went crazy with their drill at the Riviera (sport Park??).  That aside, this route is worth climbing.

    A challenging route for me - finishing the crack in particular.  Protected it with a 0.75 and 0.3  Camalot (if you're going to use a single piece, something between that would probably be best to take).  The polished foothold someone else mentioned is probably the one thing that makes finishing the crack difficult.  My partner stepped on it, but I couldn't for the life of me.  Took me many tries to find something to hold onto above the crack - taller people will have an easier time reaching (I'm 5'9").    Plenty of space to dump your gear below the crag and a plethora of places to lay out your rope tarp and stand for belay.  Luxurious in this sense.  The area is partially shaded, not nearly as exposed as the Upper.    I think this route will be on my future re-do list for a rp.

    I thought this was a good example of a 5.9+  . The day we did it I watched two people lead it (including me) and four follow.  Everyone fell off! At least once.  All the same folks routinely climbed the 10a and 10bs right next to this without a fall.  The deal is that the crack sucks you up with great pro (TCUs and stoppers) and then just when you go for what should be a locker hand jam the crack becomes off hand size.  Once you figure this out and jam your foot in the crack instead of trying to use the face holds you can yard up and get a thumb forefinger lock in just the right place.  Then its 5.9+ until you find that its solid 10 trying to go straight up on off hands and feet that are too high.
    Sep 5, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I thought this route was harder than 5.9, perhaps because I am more comfortable with footwork than hands. While the finger locks in the crack are great, the move that gets you to the first bolt is quite tough, as there are no decent footholds and the crack peters out a bit. Maybe I was just off when I was there, but I did it on TR after leading it (with some aid), and still though it was a good deal tougher than other Boulder Canyon 5.9's.    Definitely a worthwhile climb. It's ridiculously easy to place good pro below the bolts.
    Nov 17, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The crack is fun and has some great fingerlocks, but is over too quickly.  I don't know where you got a hand jam on this route, Jeff!  The upper part felt contrived and you can make it easier by not following the bolt line.
    Oct 28, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    For the length is a very nice line. If only that crack were a bit longer. (like 50 feet or so) Nice hands, just above hand jamming. You must be strict about the top and try to stay in line with the bolts, as the routes on this side of the crag are squeeze jobs. Have fun on this one.

    It may well be "The Minstrel."  Note, however, that "Mistral" is much more in keeping thematically with both "Riviera" and "Sea Breeze."  Since Rossiter lists it as "Mistral," it's probably useful to list it as an alias for folks that are cross referencing MP to printed guides, and for "Mistral" to appear in the text of this page so it shows up in a search.    I didn't find it difficult to keep this route and Sea Breeze separate--I pretty much climbed the bolted line, and so stayed clearly (though not dramatically) right of Sea Breeze, mostly centered on the short face.  As such, this route was, for me, definitely the more difficult of the two (and earned its 11a rating).

    This was kinda contrived.  Climb up the corner, clip a few bolts moving up the face on thin crimps.  Right next to Sea Breeze so it's tough to keep to one route.  Sea breeze is better.    CL

    Walt - The route is called "The Minstrel". As for the previous comment. I am not sure thay anything has broken off, there is a small crimp and the feet can be worked up a little higher perhaps for you to reach the holds just a little bit out of reach before you join back in with Seabreeze. Head back and try it again, just use the higher feet on the slab.

    I did this route a few months ago, and seemed like a fun climb - i.e., I TRd it, and wanted to come back and lead it. Went back last weekend, and tried it again, and I am convinced that a crimper toward the top has BROKEN OFF - after you move right from the vertical seam, above bolt #3, I think. There are good crimpers for both hands on the height of the 3rd bolt, and a long armsreach above, a new, blank piece of rock that seems to be where the next hold was last time. I'd be interested to see what other people say.

    If you're 5'10" or over, it's an easy first clip from the top of the  scramble. Work around to the left then up. Add a grade from what you lead in the gym, most routes are run out! Top right bolt is a spinner, be sure your top rope anchor is extension limiting and equalized. Look it up.

    This is a fun route. If you're leading, take a nut to hang on the third (maybe second?) bolt, which is missing it's hanger. You can see this from the ground.  This makes the lead a little spicier, since you'll want to move up and left (just a tad) of the bolt to keep climbing. This will make the fall not directly down, making the nut wire seems less than ideal. (Edit: this has been fixed - there is a new hanger on the bolt, so there is no need for the wire trick.) However, the holds are solid, and you're never far from another bolt on this part of the wall.

    The path of least resistance felt to be 9 range.  It is certainly not a 10 unless you really ignore a bunch of holds.  I recall a brief traverse left near the 2nd bulge. It is easier than its 10a neighbor left.

    A little bit squeezed, although if you do remain stern and follow the bolt line directly the route has quite nice moves and I would give it a 10+ rating.

    This route goes at either 10 or 11a, according to Rolofson.

    Maybe I'm short? but I found clipping the second bolt tricky...? otherwise it was really fun and found the climbing hard but doable.

    This seemed a bit harder than 11a to me.  It took me a long time to figure out the crux moves.
    Feb 28, 2014

    5.11a felt accurate to me. It seems like tricky 5.10 climbing up to the fourth (?) bolt and then 1 move of 5.11 off the small crimp to better holds above.
    Aug 6, 2013

    Seemed a bit hard for 11a, but a fun route with the hard parts well protected. Gets a lot easier but a bit runout at the top.
    Nov 7, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I led this route today, and really, really enjoyed it, but I also found it extremely challenging.  The footwork was super delicate and the crux crack really thin. We both felt it was harder than 11a.
    Jul 3, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route has some cool moves stacked one on top of each other. Too bad it starts so high off the ground and finishes early with easy and runout for no reason climbing. 11a seems fair to me. Takes great foot work to onsight and the final crux mantle is cool.

    Felt 10c to me.  Safe and fun.
    Oct 20, 2008

    I don't think the moves were any harder than 11a, there were just a lot of tricky moves for such a short climb.
    Apr 17, 2004

    Maybe I suck at footwork, but this seemed hard for an .11a to me. Maybe I was tired 'cause I'd just climbed Silver Glide.
    Sep 6, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Disagree.  11a seemed right.  Make sure it is dry.  A foot route.  2nd best on the crag after Le Nouveau Riche.  Easier than Silver Glide.    Addendum: it's probably tougher on hotter days.

    TRed this with my son today. He got it clean on 2nd try, I hung once before pulling the moves on my 2nd try. We both enjoyed it a lot. It doesn't ease up all that much after the crux.
    Mar 29, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    At first I thought this was solid 11c, but the second time I climbed it I was able to work out a better sequence in the crux.  If you implement good foot work and balance, it's more like 11a/b.  Also, my buddy Landon TRed it and found a good mantle variation at the crux to gain the right foot stem.  Not sure how hairy that move would be on lead though.  After the tricky crux, the grade eases down to very fun 5.10 face climbing.  All in all, it's a good climb.

    Ouch.  Crimpy left hands through the crux.  Ouch.  Worth a tick, but do it last to save your tips.
    Oct 20, 2008

    Agree with 11a.  Use good footwork to get up high through the crux.  Fun moves and then easy after the crux.    CL
    Mar 1, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This really is just a one-move climb but the one move is really interesting.  I had to think it over quite a while; half the difficulty is in ruling out the obvious alternatives.  I also used Leo's "vulcan hold" for the left hand and then did a push with the right to stem the right foot up.  After that I was able to stand up and reach the good stuff.  Cranking off the finger crack would work, but is much more burly.

    Fun route.  11a, maybe 11b tops and somewhat bouldery crux.

    From a sampling of this crag, there isn't much here that is too interesting. The 10 feet of tricky climbing on Silver Glide is cool, and definitely one of the area highlights.  The crux seems to be legitimate 11+, although this is definitely an easy 11+ route, given that the hard part is pretty short.  Feels more like a V3 boulder problem.
    Jul 16, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Solid 5.11d with no left hand to speak of on the crux pull.  Bomber crack for right finger must be used to walk the right foot onto a small vetical stem on narrow vertical face.  Crank on right hand hold, shift weight into rock, step up with left foot onto small ledge and reach high for pocket with left hand.  Very balancy move favoring taller climbers. The meat is 15' of hard cimbing.

    Dale Haas and I replaced the five protection bolts on this climb and two anchor bolts(shared with Chouette) with 3/8" SS Powers Power-Bolts (AKA 5-piece). We added SS quicklinks and rings to the anchor.    The hardware for this project was provided by the American Safe Climbing Association(ASCA - safeclimbing.org). They appreciate your support.

    Lead this today. Placed a few pieces of gear for peace of mind but could have done with less (or none). Kind of a weird route but actually pretty fun. I bypassed the "choss" at the top by traversing right on a nice ledge and finishing on the last 2 bolts of Infestation. Fair amount of rope drag but a nicer finish and lowered off Mussey hooks (so we could toprope Infestation).     Not a bad route &amp; long (used almost all of our 60m rope to do it and lower). I'd rate it 5.6 . Really didn't seem like 5.7 to me.
    Aug 16, 2014

    Can be done on gear relatively safely. I clipped two bolts, the first and the last, and could have probably done without either.

    Definitely five bolts on this one.
    Oct 30, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    3rd route from the right now, the second being Infestation (5.9) and Monte Carlo (5.6). Three bolts at the anchors as Greg said that I can confirm worked very well and can be used for a toprope safely.    5 bolts on the way to the anchors with a bit of a runout between the second and the third. Done without a rack pretty safely for a confident climber as the climbing between the runout is easy, much like Chouette to the left.
    Mar 19, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I checked the anchor today. The bolts cannot be tightened, because they are Rawls and will not tighten. They looked good other than the hangers being loose. I added a 3rd bolt to give everyone warm fuzzy feelings. Especially since these are popular beginner routes.

    Just went there today, and there are two new bolted routes to the right of Splash. I was there a month ago, and they were not there. So, no longer is Splash the furthermost route to the right. The starts are a little tricky, especially if you stay to the right of the bolt on the route to the right of Splash. If I were to guess, I would say a few 5.9 moves then gets easier on the way up.

    There are enough gear placements that this could probably be led more  safely on all gear than on all bolts with no gear.  Next time I'm up there I'll try it and see.

    WARNING: The Anchors at the top Spin!! Somebody should check them out, as I'm not an expert...    I already posted this comment on the Chouette (5.6) route, but since these routes share the same anchor, I thought I would post it here too, just in case.    The route itself is really nice for beginners (like myself). If you can do Chouette, you can do this one too. It's not as run out as Chouette, but you can place pro if you feel the need.    -ajs

    This is a nice little route.  A great warmup for other climbs at the Riv.  I gave it a 5.7, but it's just barely so.  It could just as easily get a 5.6.  There is a nice variety of moves, and they are all very well protected.  I agree with the concensus that a few pieces of gear are helpful if you're not too confident.
    Nov 20, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A fun beginner practice lead with some variety to make you think. You can either run it out a bit between bolts or have fun practicing placing pro inbetween,which is probably a good idea anyways in a couple of spots. Nice play to go if short on time as approach is easy as well.

    There's definitely 5 bolts on the route, all right where you'd want them.  This route is a fun romp up a slab, with beautiful moves.  I'd give it two or three stars, personally, but then I just love runout granite slab routes.  It was a hoot!
    Feb 5, 2002

    I only counted 4 bolts, but there are many places for gear in between the bolts. A decent line for a new leader as the bolts are easily supplemented with gear (#0.75 Camalot and smaller). Anchor at top does not have any rap rings placed on it so watch your rope on this one, or just walk off to the right and walk the 50' to the ground.

    I climbed this 2/18/17 &amp; I'm 5'8". 5.8 is true to the grade and a very fun lead.  Though the first bolt is high off the ground, it's very easy to get to. If you stay left, below the bolt, you can comfortably stand and clip it. Again, I'm 5'8", but at that stance, the bolt was just above head high. Fun climb, maybe a bit over bolted but great for the grade. If you're new to 5.8, do this climb, it's a good one.

    I am a very new leader and also very short (5'3"). I tried to lead this route for the first time but could not figure out moves to get comfortable clipping the first bolt. Have other short leaders had this problem, or did I just miss it? I tried coming straight up from the bottom...and then tried to go to the left of the line and traverse in...unsuccessfully. Thanks.

    The top 20ft is all run out but prob 5.6. A "no fall zone". I would say a 5.9+ lead because of the slabby feet.

    Lead this today. Really pretty fun, but like some other routes at this crag, the line is a little indistinct. As others have said, no obvious crux but pretty sustained with a few nice rests.    I'd call this "old school" 5.7 or modern 5.8.

    The bolts are fine.  Weird but fun route.
    May 9, 2006

    Fun route that is fairly consistently good climbing. From the anchors, it is also possible to traverse left over the anchors for Devin's Dihedral enabling you to set up a top rope for that route. (As of today, the third hanger was spinning but the bolt looked good).
    Dec 24, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Dear AC,    Regarding the "loose bolts" on Topless Etiquette:Is the actual bolt spinning or merely the hanger? Spinning hangers are common and all that is generally required is an easy turn of the wrench. Spinning hangers are usually not dangerous unless the bolt has come dangerously unthreaded. If the bolt itself is spinning, it should be replaced.
    Nov 8, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    WARNING: The 3rd Bolt from the bottom is loose and spinning!! Is there anyone out there who monitors these routes? I don't know how to replace the bolts, but I thought someone should know...    Loose bolt aside, this is a really fun moderate route. Good moves the whole way, with good protection. It's just as easy to use the lower set of anchors as it is to use the upper set. Watch out for the wet spot near the 3rd bolt.    -ajs

    Excellent 5.8 sport route - fun and continuous.
    Jul 16, 2004

    This is a nice little route.  I counted six bolts today though; the last bolt is maybe two or three feet away from the next-to-last.  Is that a new bolt?  Definitely felt natural to just head over to the anchors to the left, rather than straight up through the blocky section.
    Sep 6, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route is quite nice and continuous, not a very defined crux as there are harder sections for shorter/taller folks. A good route to practice footwork, especially for newbies to moderate slab routes. I had fun on this one and only wish it could be longer. Just as easy to use the anchors to the left instead of going through the blocky quartzite ridge.

    This climb starts on the first pitch of "South," a climb not yet listed here and one I've done 4 times. This start is in a very distinct, right-facing dihedral just 20 feet left of the "Bitty Buttress" route and is 5.7; it protects well.
    Dec 4, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route has one of the sweetest top outs in BC; a big grassy ledge with some shade and great views. Be careful with the bush just below the dihedral starts, it can snag your rope. The last pitch can be aided at C1 and provides an excellent link-up with Holy Ascension (C2(+?) or 5.13). Most routes adjacent to A's Jax's third pitch can be accessed by scrambling from the left to the top of Peapod's belay ledge and following easy 4th class to the upper ledge system.

    Did this route for the first time yesterday.    I would agree with Anton - the start is stiff warm-up with little gear.    I combined P1 and P2 with a 70m and about 10 shoulder length runners. I had 3m of spare rope at the juniper.

    Great route. Every pitch is classic. Average grade on this route is 5.7+/8 IMO. Each pitch has its own crux that challenges you just enough. I would be a solid 5.8 leader before going for this. Protected the start of pitch 1 and pitch 3, as well as high in the crux on pitch 3 with ballnuts (1 and 2). Pitch 3 definitely has a 5.9 move.    Never used anything bigger than a #3 c4/new Friend. Offset cams come in handy but not needed.    Do roof finish after the crux on pitch 3 then walk off west. I will repeat this route for years to come.

    If you are a granite tradmaster, you'll float up this with a smile on your face. If, like me, you are more used to sandstone and clipping bolts, here are a few thoughts on gear:     Pitch one is long! I would bring doubles from thin hands to tips, and I wished I had more large stoppers, like 3/4" to 1". I would have placed a couple of small tricams if I had them. I ran out of runners, so I set up a belay and tricked my partner into leading the run out finish of P1! I would probably bring 16 draws for this pitch and all alpine draws as rope drag can be a drag ;) I found the pitch to have good gear at the harder parts and some runouts at the easier parts. I didn't love my third placement off the deck - a shallow C3.    At the third pitch crux, I got in the good cam from the good stance below the crux (green C4 maybe?) and flipped in a #4 BD steel nut into the thin crack above. There was a fixed wire in there, but it looked to be jammed upside down, and I didn't bother to clip it, because it looked useless and I couldn't reach it. I didn't fall on the steel nut, but it actually seemed like a decent piece.     The start move on P2 off the big grassy ledge was slightly absurd, I went with the awkward high step. I guess there is a more graceful way to do it but not at 5.8 that I could find!

    Just led the crux pitches (1&amp;3) on this this morning, and the first 20' or so felt like a stiff warm-up to me with poor protection...8+/9-ish. There are a couple photos on here showing people placing a cam (maybe a 0.5?) in a perfect crack behind a triangular-ish block/flakethis flake isn't completely solid. I gingerly jammed this crack but didn't place gear here despite really wanting to. Seemed like a good idea, but if one were to actually fall onto said placement, I think this block/flake would actually pop off on to your belayer, along with your body. Maybe not.    Other than that, outstanding route with a heady start and an exciting crux on P3 (feels 5.9). Definitely belay at the big, grassy ledge at the top of P1, and then combine the 2nd and 3rd pitch (including the 7 roof) into another long second pitch.

    Fun route with interesting features to keep you on your toes (literally, just the tips of your toes in some parts).    Can be done in two pitches with a 70m rope.     First pitch to the large ledge (or a bit higher if ya don't want to belay on the super cushy block).     Second pitch should end at a large boulder atop the crag where anchor placements are straightforward.     5.8+ first? 5.9- third? let's even it out and call the route a 5.9.    For the first pitch, remind yourself that it isn't okay to fail. Because in this case you may end up with a branch up your bum.      As always, watch out for ground eels on the approach....

    Jan 21. Climbed BB in 60 degree temps, sunny, slight breeze, perfect Saturday. We were the only ones at the crag.    The start of pitch 1 is tough to protect, but I did not find it to be a R route. The crux of the first pitch, for me, was the small roof near the top of the. You can cheat out to the left on the slab, but the straight up move is nice.    Pitch 2 was ok.    Pitch 3 protects well. Commit to the moves you see, it's 5.8+ or 9- (whatever). The holds are there.    Cheers,    Prod.
    Jan 22, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Here's another recommendation.  Climb Bitty Buttress, then walk uphill a ways, and climb On Ballet on upper Blob Rock.  This gives you 6 pitches of nice trad 5.8 and 5.9.  I think On Ballet is about the same level of difficulty as Bitty Buttress, and the quality of climbing is also similar.  Pitch 2 of On Ballet is a wee bit run out, but if you're comfortable with Bitty Buttress it won't be a problem, since there are also a few wee runouts on BB.

    Climb this route, and then hike over and do "The Young and the Rackless" for an extremely fun day. Three fine pitches, 100 yards of scrambling, and 3 more fine pitches. Bitty Buttress is mentally more challenging, but the moves on Y and R are slightly harder. A great warmup for the season if you have been lounging on the couch for a few months. Or if you have out of town visitors, a great way to introduce them to life in Colorado. One of my favorite days in Boulder Canyon.

    The route description doesn't mention the descent, so here's one way to go. At the top of P3 under the small roof with the 5.7 crack in it, move carefully to the left. With the exposure, you'll almost want to try and squeeze on by on this ledge, but you're better off hanging your body off the edge and just keeping your hands at that level. Look down the steep wall and locate some footholds to allow you to get your body in a better position. The big gear you brought will protect the traverse nicely.     Keep your hands level with the ledge, getting jams and face holds as you go. A ramp will start to reach up below you and you can eventually get onto it and scramble to the large, grassy ledge with a dead tree. Build an anchor here to belay your second across the traverse. You won't be able to talk to your second unless you move all the way to the edge looking back. We did this exit today while it was lightly raining and we were really glad to have pro in.    Right where the dead tree is, climb up the rocks and keep to the left. You'll see a clean slab that goes to the summit, but if you keep left you'll better access the large ledge system that gets you down into the gully between Bitty Buttress and the next formation over. Note the various bolted sport routes on the steep, clean wall in the gully on your way down.     The start of the route is essentially an arete in case you can't see that in the photos. There is a large, dead tree directly under the arete. As some others mentioned, you can stand on it to start the route. When you get to the top of P1, move around to the right and then up again until you can see the dihedral that starts the second pitch. This gets you in a better position to belay that. If you belay down lower to make it easier to talk to your second on P1, the rope will be having to turn a corner for belaying P2. Plus, the belay up here is really flat and cush. Two large cracks intersect where you sit that will take large cams and your leg as added insurance.

    This route has a very nice direct line, although one can never really see the whole route until you get on it. Hats off, once again, to the good ole boys that sniffed out this snoopster.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    With H. McIntypre 5/21/06. Rossiter guidebook topo suggests a start in the 'Orange Dihedral' and an airy but easy traverse about 40 feet up. We climbed P1 this way and found the pro to be adequate and the traverse fun. P2 start is bouldery. A direct line can be liebacked on the upper part of this pitch and is harder (and more fun) than the 5.6 advertised in the guidebook. P3 follows a flake (didn't look like a 'dihedral' to me). Crux sequence is balancy, a bit subtle, and solid 5.8; take a moment to work it out.    Didn't look like the route has seen all that much traffic this spring, maybe it's the long (for Boulder Canyon) approach. No chalk was visible the day we climbed and it had kind of a 'wild' feel to it.

    One move wonder. The belay  at the top of P2 is sweet, P3 has 4 cool moves leading up to a fun crux move. Won't do again.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Very quality route,  I didn't see the chopped bolts that everyone talked about though.  Anyway, I thought the crux was on P1 right at the top on the face.  I must have been off route or something because I had to transition to another crack from left to right and that move was much more difficult than the crux on P3.  Ron Olsen mentioned above that "the protection is adequate but not ideal" which I found to be perfectly accurate on P1.  I felt the crux on P3 was pretty easy.  I put in a purple Alien right before the crack ran out and it fits bomber.  I tired to put in a blue alien above that but it was just a waste of time as I am certain it wouldn't have held had I pitched off.  I was also able to place many times below the purple Alien so the gear protection is pretty good on P3.  You just have to suck it up at the crux and climb through; afterall you're only a few feet above your last piece so it's no big deal.  A very good climb!

    No consensus? Well, then I'll cast my vote. I'm glad the bolts are gone, though it doesn't make up for them being there in the first place. After all, the holes remain, no matter how anyone tries to camouflage them. I was annoyed when I saw them last spring. I don't think I even clipped them because they are in a lousy location - they'd just have added drag for belaying up my partner.    This route has everything you could want in a moderate trad climb -- great position, fun moves, solid rock, beautiful views, and a couple of moderate runouts to keep you focused. I have no idea why someone saw fit to drill a couple of holes into the middle of it. The bolts, and now the holes, serve only to eliminate the pleasant illusion that you were the first one there, with no significant benefit to safety. Chopping them partially restores the route.

    I have climbed this route with and without the bolts. I have also used the bolts, but even if they were there I would not use them again because of the bad location when starting the second pitch. I am glad the bolts are gone. This is a unique and incredible natural line for the grade. Very Fun.

    AC:I see Darren Mabe answered the chopped/removed question for you. Looks like neither happened.    Occam's Razor is a crappy concept touted by those who wish to forward their over-simplied suggestions to entertain personal indulgences and to push private agendas.    Properly applied to to this situation, it would say that some other random climber pounded the bolts in, not that I did it on my way out of town to Indian Creek last weekend.     Properly applied to your assertion here, it would say that you must be anonymously grinding a personal axe since you have no real knowledge of the situation.    Or you can break free of this O.R. crap and look at it more logically. People have a need for a visible enemy. They like to know who they are fighting, so you blame the situation on me so that you are not fighting an invisible foe. Makes you feel better regardless doesn't it. I don't like the old "someone must hang" mentality though. I think you better get some facts first. But I hope you don't get any, I like watching you suffer the unknown.

    I was up there on Sunday.  The hangers were already removed and the studs pounded back in, as if it really matters.  I was ready to remove them anyway if they were still there when I did the climb.    This didn't need a majority consensus.  The bolts were not necessary, were not even arranged for a rap anchor (vertical pattern, no chains/rap-rings), at a height more than 30m, and the normal belay is 15 feet higher on a grassy ledge with bomber gear.    I shouldn't be wasting my arthritic fingers even typing all of this, the issue is simple: the anchors served no purpose on a multipitch trad climb that has been established probably about 40 years ago.    So, what is the argument in the first place?

    As you know Tony, "chopped" is a figure of speech. Were the bolts actually CHOPPED or were they REMOVED and the holes filled/camouflaged?    In any event, chopping them would be a nice way for a bolt-remover to cover his tracks? Maybe the bolt-remover was under a time crunch. Maybe they were on their way out of town. I'm not accusing anyone, but I am familiar with Occam's Razor.    Occam's Razor: A sort of credibility test that holds that all things being equal, the simplest reasonable explanation for a phenomenon is probably the right one.

    [I'm] surprised that you [didn't] mind the bolts, [Stefan], since you refused to clip the bolts on the [Dominator] at the [Avalon] (short, now cleaned, good but not a three star route), which seems less of an issue to me than adding bolts on a 40 yr old 3-star classic in the same canyon.  If these bolts are for a sport climb, the author of that sport climb should have had the respect for the hardmen that led these pitches in 1964 with leather boots and pitons and probably a rope tied around their waist, and placed the bolts off to the side of the existing climb.  These bolts are right in line with the climbing on [Bitty Buttress], except for that the better belay is up another few feet on a comfy grassy ledge.  I guess if you need the killer photo op to look down and shoot pics of your second you should belay from these bolts, but i would think you could even get gear on this ledge if you wanted to. Besides the fact that the bolts were added (and if the bolter can vouch that Pat A. said go for it, [I'll] shut up), they [don't] have rings to rap on.  Plus, who carries two ropes up this kind of climb, except a party of three?  What seems likely to happen is that an inexperienced party would think they are finished with what probably seemed a spicy 5.8 pitch, decide there is a second anchor below since they [don't] see an obvious 2nd pitch and then rap into oblivion since you would need two ropes to get down.  So in my opinion the bolts are not only unsightly and unnecessary, and possibly disrespectful, but they may serve to add further danger to the route.

    They are right at the top of the first pitch of BB.  The bolts are on a small (~1-2') ledge on your left, not the huge ledge below the 1st move of P2.  I would guess that they were placed for BB, and not the sport climb on the left, but I have not done the sport climb.  They were there sometime back in April or May when I last did this climb.  You can't even see them until you are standing at the ledge, and they're actually placed quite conveniently for belaying up the second.  I had done this climb 2-3x previously, and I didn't feel they changed the nature of the climb itself.  However, I will agree that they serve purely as a convenience anchor.

    Are the new bolts on Bitty Buttress (BB) proper or on the newish sport route to the left? I'm assuming the latter; that would be really bad if somebody reto-bolted this classic trad line.

    You can protect the opening moves with a small cam (1-1.5cm). I had my belayer hand it up to me after I got another piece in.    Did anyone else find pitch 3 ambiguous? I've done it twice, the "wrong way" both times. The first time I headed left. It couldn't have been more than 5.7, considering it did it at night with a headlamp (we were delayed by my diabetic partner's hypoglycemia). The second time (yesterday) I headed right because I'd used the cams that would have protected the crux. It felt a full grade harder than pitch 1, so I'll call it 5.9. It also puts you too far right to belay - your partner won't appreciate being poorly protected on the traverse left to the belay ledge.    You can link pitches 2 and 3 with a 60m rope - but watch the rope drag and save some cams for the crux.

    This is an excellent route. Great position.  I've led this route once before and it ranks high for best in the canyon for the grade in my book.      IMO the first 20' is no harder than (8) with good pro.I would guess this start was harder when the fallen tree wasn't there.  Moving left onto the slab in the final 15' of P1 is a bit balancey and runnout.A .5 cam under a hollow flake/undercling was my last placement in that last 10', but its easy climbing.     I could see where the start of P2 could be troublesome for some shorter people, but the upper corner in the last 2' felt like the crux on the pitch to me. No harder than (8) though with good pro.     P3 is spicy in the last 10'.  Fun varied climbing with good placements up to that point.As Ron mentions, a .75 cam is bomber just below the crux.  A black alien will fit a foot higher, the blue does not fit.IMO the crux sequence felt (9) moving up and left.

    This route is incredible to do on sunny winter days. It was a no shell or jacket day.Getting off the ground just above the fallen dead tree log feels a bit challenging.  After moving six feet up, I found myself moving left to step up a few ledges before traversing back right.  The majority of P1 is pure bliss....fun climbing with great gear placements.  You just keep moving up and the route will push you to step left out onto the face (near the end of the pitch).Getting off the ledge on the start of P2 can also be challenging if you are short.  I have one lay back move with wide leg stemming action before I can grab good holds and feel solid.  The rest of P2 is fun and again full of good gear placements.  The crux is defnately on P3 just before you top out and if you are a relatively new 5.8 leader bring a rope gun or be super confident on your feet and have great balance.  I want to follow P3 one more time before leading it as the crux feels like a 5.9 move to me.  Enough said, perhaps too much said.  Enjoy!

    One comment on the gear: on the third pitch, I get in a #2 Camalot low in the corner, a #.75 Camalot several feet higher, and then a red #1 Lowe ball nut in the thin parallel-sided crack just before the crux.    Regarding the approach: I use the gully directly below the rock that starts about 50 yards downstream from the Cob Rock parking area.  It is a little loose in spots, but there is a reasonable climber's path all the way up, after an initial scramble past an easy steep rock band. The danger of knocking down loose rocks is minimal, and it's a lot faster than traversing over from the Blob Rock trailhead.

    A wonderful, thought-provoking climb with adequate, but less-than-perfect pro on the first and third pitches.    An optional fourth pitch, up a 5.7 overhang directly above the third belay, is highly recommended.  Short but fun.  Run out the rope and belay near the top of the summit slabs.  Tag the summit of Bitty Buttress on your way to the descent gully.

    There's a giant nest on the far far right of the ledge at the top of the first pitch.  It's very visible if you walk off from the top of the route around to the East (towards Boulder) and down a gully (the second inviting gully, the first one is a cliff).

    This sunny route has some steep and varied moves on it. Leave the big gear at home, most of the pro is finger to thin hands.  Extra finger sized cams and the smallest tricams are useful.  The descent is a walk off to the west along a 3rd class ledge system.

    I'd like to consider myself a solid 5.13 climber having put down five different 5.13s within a five week period just before getting on this route. I got shut down hard at the crux of this route. I was also not impressed by the quality of the route. The moves were awkward, holds were sharp, and some of the feet were a slippery type granite. Some of the holds were moist from a recent rain, I will have to go back and revisit it in drier and colder conditions. Either way, Lorax and Rise and Shine deserve a lot more attention than this route in my opinion. On the other hand, the wall that the Buzz is on is very inspiring and impressive looking down on it from high up in the gully. Very striking and photogenic for sure....

    I have sent The Buzz, but I haven't put away Vasodilator yet. In my opinion, Vasodilator is a bit more difficult, because it is relentlessly hard from top to bottom.  The crux of The Buzz may be a tad harder than any of the moves on Vasodilator (although the egg-like rounded arete at the end of Vaso is pretty sick), but the climbing on either side of the crux is only 12a.  So you only have to do hard moves for about 8 feet.  Vasodilator is super continuous and pumpy - more hard climbing for sure.

    My first try on Return to Sender left me with the following impression.  P1 is 5.8 to a dirty corner that involves a somewhat dangerous "behind your back" clip that transitions you to the next slab after one or two steep moves on very questionable rock.  From here, make easy moves on loose, dirty rock (careful not to pull anything down and kill somebody) and encounter one move of 5.11a followed by low angle 5.7 or 5.8 slab to the first set of anchors.  P2 features a nice variety of "snappy" "hollow" crimpers and flakes all poised brilliantly on a Volkswagen-sized block that looks like it could break away from the wall entirely with the right amount of conviction.  The crux will catch your attention indeed, not so much by the "wild move" that has been advertised but more so by the sloping ledge that you may or may not strike if you happen to miss.  A few more awkward throws gets you to the final set of anchors which consequently are guarded fabulously by a choice selection of football to microwave size blocks.  Again, be careful not to pull anything down and kill somebody.  Enjoy!

    My first try on Return to Sender left me with the following impression. P1 is a nifty way to link up two slabs that get you to P2, which would otherwise have a rotten approach. In its own right P1 is a blast and entails some nice thin slabbing with a tough mantle in the link up. It looks like it needs some brushing, but while climbing that seemed insignificant. P2 is the meat, and I won't give anything away. It has two cruxes, as Mark indicated. The lower crux will be very height dependent. I hung off the jug at the end of the first crux and could just graze my toe on the spot used to launch the move. If you are 6' 5", it might feel 5.10, if you are 5' 7" it would feel like 5.14. There are two solutions, but the short person variation will certainly come at higher than 5.12a/b. The second crux is what it is, either you do it or you don't. It's a nifty and very technical dyno, a brief, perfect althletic moment (or perhaps several attempts at a brief, perfect athletic moment). Nice addition. Solid rock. Well protected. And it gets good early sun.

    Excellent climb.  Very well bolted, and no clips are hard to make.  In late May, the climb gets some morning shade from the Lorax roof, but the belay alcove is hot.  Shade by 1 pm.  For rope drag, consider clipping the first bolt on the regular (not direct) start with a long runner, then move over to the direct start and clip the third bolt with a long runner (i.e. skip the second bolt on the non-direct start).  This keeps your rope off the rock.  The move off the ledge (6th bolt) is probably the thinnest, but the climbing doesn't really let up after that.  Consider differentially resting your right hand (sacrifice the left a little), to save for the top, where it's still pumpy.  Also, you can move right while still below the top bolt then clip from the right, rather than working up the rounded L-facing arete.  Otherwise, you have to downclimb a few moves to go right to the anchors anyway.

    If it weren't for the crappy rock and blocky, awkward climbing down low ,this would be a 3 star route. It's worth the time though.

    This may be the best 12a in Boulder Canyon, reminiscent of limestone climbing if you can believe it.  And honest at the grade too.  I thought the crux, unquestionably, was getting started on the upper face at bolt #6.  The upper part is very pumpy featuring a burly match on a sloping horn... maybe a redpoint crux for some, but not as technically difficult as lower down. Watch out for some bad rock in the initial corner.  The trad variation to the upper part is excellent, and worthy of 3 stars as well.

    This route has potential but needs some major gardening. The route follows the dihedral but has lots of bushes and dirt. The line is very aestethic though. We did a bit of pruning just to get up it but it needs more work to earn the star it gets in Bob D'antino's book. I agree with his 5.8 rating. The second pitch (the one shared with A's Jax) is much cleaner and has a nice roof/chimney that looks much harder than it is.

    Climbs lacking loose debris, whether rock or lichen, haven't necessarily been climbed previously. Those may be composed of a more resistant rock and/or lie in areas more exposed to wind and sun.     Conversely, lichen-infested climbs that have lots of loose rock might have been climbed previously. I have left most of my many shaggy passages in original condition because I chose not to chalk, clean, brush, or trundle, although I have moved or tossed rocks that threatened my companions.

    A fun (mostly trad) 5.10 variation can be climbed in the dihedral, a few feet to the right of the first four bolts.  Continue up to the fifth bolt, staying to the right of the 11d section. Clip more bolts and place more gear, as you reach back left to the upper part of Bands and climb 5.10 to its anchors.

    I found this climb and loved it, it has a lot for a moderate climb - crimps, slaps, slopes, heels, cracks, aretes, and much much more - but I agree with the above mentioned statement.  Whomever bolted this route needs to do the rest of the climbing world a favor and never bolt again.  My favorite part is the bolt that was placed too deeply and is simply sitting in the face with no anchor whatsoever - thank you for not actually putting an anchor on that bolt by the way - but the route is a very interesting climb.  Altogether, the landing is stellar, the climb is in the shade and bolts 5-14 are part of an amazing climb.  Glad I found it, if it wasn't for the bolting, I would have rated this a 2 star problem.

    I found this to be the most poorly bolted (dangerous) sport climb I've done in Boulder Canyon.  At the bottom, the bolts are so close you might z-clip, then it's "adventure sport climbing" through plants, trees, loose rock, and hard to reach bolt hangers above the first big ledge.  The upper section of this pitch is extremely dirty and the anchors are positioned in a way that causes continuous strain on the rope.      The overall line is very nice however and a few pieces of supplemental gear (and a wire brush) might make this climb more enjoyable.

    Tough climb. Even without the right-shoulder-dislocating, V-Gnar-Gnar crux getting into the corner, this thing would still be solid 5.12. One of the hardest cruxes on a 5.12 around Boulder  maybe a longer wingspan helps?

    I redpointed this in the Fall of 2008 just before my partner Kaelen Williams did. He redpointed both "Resinator" (5.12d) and "Caught In The Web" that day. As for me, it is my second day on this route in 2008.  I had tried the route years before that.  This route has some sustained, technical, vertical to overhung climbing on it. I enjoyed the unusual nature of the climb. It was very challenging.  There are some things that detract from its quality.  The belay zone in the talus is not great. Lowering off the bottom 20 feet sends you down through bushes, unless you swing left and come down the start of the route.  The 5th and 7th bolts are higher than they need to be.  Put a long Petzl quickdraw on the 5th bolt but not a long sling.  I still have a small battle scar on my bicep where the biner and rope pinched my skin when a weighted the rope at this bolt with a long sling on it.  The 7th bolt can be clipped with the left hand on the crystal knob if you double draw it. Otherwise, skip the bolt or clip it past the final crux up the diagonal ramp corner.

    Definitely hard for .12c.  I don't think this was really anything like Flying Beast.  Way more technical, not as much power endurance.  You can get a good stem rest before exiting the dihedral.

    You guys are too modest: this is stout even for 12c; it's similar in difficulty and feel to Flying Beast on Easter Rock.  The cross over into the corner at the fourth bolt is brutal (the start of the business) and then it's sustained almost to the end.  It may seem odd to give beta for the 5.6 approach to a 12c, but you'll be a lot safer going to the first [bolt] through the bushes on the right than trying to climb in from the left. Great job.

    A stellar slab route. Definitely "well" bolted. Would be quite a bit more fun if the bolting was a bit spicier...but very fun. I found it easier than Gyromancy, and would suggest a grade of no harder than 5.11a.

    Great route. Thanks, Vaino, for doing such a fine job bolting &amp; cleaning. That said, shame on Bob D'Antonio for putting it in his Boulder Canyon guidebook that you can get down this climb with a 60 meter rope &amp; to Ron Olsen for doing so in this post. Please refer to my guidebook "Boulder Canyon Sport &amp; Adventure Climber's Guide - Volume II (2005)" that states bring a 70 meter rope or two ropes to descend. A guidebook writer shouldn't given a pass by the climbing community or industry for such a dangerous error.    So here is a trick to get down this route with a 60 meter rope. Anchor in at the top anchor &amp; be taken off belay. Pull the rope up through all the protection bolts &amp; drop it back to the ground. Have your belayer put you back on belay. Make sure they put a knot in the end of the rope. As you are lowered, the belayer can walk left uphill so they are standing on higher ground. This should solve the problem &amp; allow you to lower to the ground.

    Really good route. Overall more sustained than The Scientist over at Plotinus, but the actual crux is significantly easier.

    Superb, sustained slab climbing. The crux is at least .11a and probably .11b. If you plan on climbing Kate Moss as well as Consilience, a 70m rope (or two 60s) is mandatory. Lowering from Consilience takes 105' -110' of rope; lowering from Kate Moss takes about 115'.

    Very fun route and an interesting slab climb. D'Antonio is the FA Meister!!  Thanks for this one Bob!    I was surprised to see so many excellent climbers rating this 11 and not even easy 11.     Maybe I am off here but it makes me think  I was on the wrong route ...   To offer some benchmark comparisons for perspective.     &gt; Crux of Aerospace in Eldo rated 11b,   &gt; last Pitch of Doub Griffith rated 11b,   &gt; 1st pitch of Athletes Feat rated 11a,   &gt; 1st pitch of Country Club rated 11c,   &gt; Naked Edge     Don't get me wrong. I'm not dissing the route, at all, because it is great climbing and really fun. A great addition by Bob, Vanio &amp; Moe all of whom can can climb way harder than this.  However nothing on this route feels even close to as hard as any single crux on the comparison routes I listed. That's just my opinion in trying to bring some perspective to some route ratings in Bolter Canyon which many times  seems to be on some other scale than the US Yosemite Decimal System when it comes to ratings on many of the bolted routes. Line this up next to slab routes else where in the USA rated 11 and I don't think it  compares.     Enjoy, but  watch out when lowering off this one as a 200 foot rope is not quite long enough to get you all the way down!!!

    Fantastic climb - the midsection is reminiscent of the second pitch of Earth Voyage in Dream - delicate diagonal.  We predict though that we'll hear soon about someone decking off of this line - 60m given the variability in lengths of 60m cords isn't necessarily sufficient - 70m better!  Kate Moss and the neighbor to the right are worthy warmups as well.

    A stellar climb; probably the best sport route I've done in Boulder Canyon.  Continuously interesting climbing from bottom to top, with many 5.10 moves and several spots of 5.11.  The route was quite clean, with no moss or lichen in evidence.    The move to the first bolt wasn't too bad; I didn't feel the need for a stick clip.    A 70m rope works well, allowing you to lower or rappel with a few feet of rope to spare.

    There may be only one other slab climb better than this in  Boulder Canyon.  That would be, in my opinion, Bearcat Goes to Hollywood. We had rope shortage with 60 meters, and had to leave a biner.  It was worth it.  Finding the route is straightforward.  It is not very far up the gully between Black Widow and Vampire.  The picture on the route description makes its location obvious.  There is another route just to the left (Kate Moss?) that is unappealing in appearance.

    Great route. The bolts could use a refresh as the post crux bolt is a spinner, and most of the hangers have an aged look. It's a mix of wedges and sleeves. The anchor could use a make over too as it's sporting webbing now w/ perma biners.    A few critical large holds on the route are slathered in glue which detracts from things a bit.

    Yes, my girlfriend is 5'1" and did that move completely static. She actually flashed the route fairly easy after watching me. We constantly get on routes where there is a "height" dependent move, and she always figures out a way to do it, usually with just higher feet than most people will use. I did The Juice (12d) last year with a crux I was told couldn't be done unless you're over 6' tall. I'm 5'7" and did the move really easily with some uber high feet. Power to the short people!

    (Big thanks to Chris for sending me some beta to read during my bus commute!)    Dracula is a really fun route, although if you don't have really long arms, I could see the last move of the crux as being a bit frustrating. My arms were fortunately just long enough to keep it from being too heinous.  I would love to watch a really good, smaller climber do this route - it would probably be an impressive display.      Couple quick notes: this route makes a good, quick, after work project - there are no tweaky moves, so you don't need a warmup route.  The first half is easy and slabby but still really nice climbing. You will want a 12" draw on the 2nd bolt on the headwall, otherwise the rope wants to grind over a fairly sharp edge as you traverse up and right.  Also, don't be discouraged if you struggle on your first attempt.  It would be a tricky onsight, but once you dial a couple things in, the climbing just comes together really nicely.  The last couple bolts seemed like they were placed a bit higher than I wanted, but with some patience, it works out.  Some of the bolts seemed kind of old.  Not sure if it was the lack of washers that gave me that impression?    Anyway, do this route - it is pretty sweet.

    Tricky route to onsight but well worth the effort to do so. Not a great route to push the grade on in my opinion as a groundfall is possible if you blow the hardest (yeah, the hardest moves are off the ground) moves of the route getting to the first bolt. Being tall is helpful and footwork is key higher up. Good crack moves to finish the route as well.

    This is a fun route with a wide variety of moves.  Stick-clipping isn't necessary, but not a bad idea.  If you're tall enough, you don't have to mess around with the jugs below and can get holds high and levitate your feet.  Getting out of the dihedral after the second bolt is probably the crux.  The dihedral can be stemmed or the dihedral's left arete laybacked.  The arete/face above requires some thought.

    Climbed this yesterday. It's nice and long. We wanted to summit the whole tower, so I led up above the anchors. You can get a good cam in the undercling above the anchors, but that's pretty much the last good piece. Further up, there's a shitty bolt that I don't trust - maybe an old Star Dryvin that wasn't driven in all the way with the nail bent over. Anyway, even above the bolt, I didn't see gear opportunities so I downclimbed (it looks like there is in the photo, but there isn't). The climbing wasn't too hard, but all the moss and no pro made it feel sketchy. Looks like it could have been cool had I made it all the way to the large, horizontal crack below the roof systems.

    A very good and long pitch.  And a good warm up for the other great climbs here.  It seems that this area is somewhat overlooked as the climbs are excellent and the competition for routes is nil.  There is a quick link on the 3rd bolt about 30 feet up which allows one to rappel from the anchors and then pull the rope and rap again from the 3rd bolt.  It looked like a much better set up for descending could easily be set up by putting a double anchor 3 bolts down from the top and then extending the upper 3 bolts into another 60 meter pitch.  Curious since the descent takes away from the quality of the route.

    Thanks for your comment, Jack. Bob's book is just wrong about climbing the crack on the upper part (pitch 2) of the climb &amp; so is the route description posted on this page of MP. The crack is Bong Session. I have climbed both routes, &amp; I love Pipe Dreams. Please refer to the earlier guidebooks such as Richard Rossiter's or my "Boulder Canyon Sport &amp; Adventure Climber's Guide - Volume II". The climb ascends the face which has some nice pockets. I really like this part of the route.    Yes, the crux is at 2nd bolt. I do prefer to avoid stemming to the mossy dihedral (around 8th bolt), because the face climbing up the seam is so cool. Stemming takes away from the sustained nature of this part of the climb. Yes, you can call it contrived if you like. The nearby dirty corner detracts from the quality, but it is obvious to me that it is off route.

    The second half of this climb is confusing. From the ledge, I saw three options: 1. climb straight up the bolted face above the ledge;  2. climb the hand crack to the left of the bolts to its own anchor, this is what the guidebook says to do;  3. climb the corner on the right and reach over and clip. The upper part is weird with a lot of options. It might be a better route if it stopped at the first anchor. Also stemming into the corner on the first half is the smart way to climb it, staying on the face the whole time is way contrived. If this route stopped at the first anchor, I still think it would be 12b due to the hard start.

    To clarify this route description, the second section stays just to the right of the wide crack using pockets and face holds that move upwards and right to finish with a thin crack and the anchors. Also, I did the first free ascent after setting this route up. -John Baldwin.

    This is a nice climb, but if what Matt B says is true, that after you pull the first crux, the line originally finished in the corner at 12d. I think it's quite a bummer someone came and added bolts up the face, we have taken a decent 12d and turned it into a contrived but good 13a (Bo Can has plenty of these climbs already). I have a really hard time forcing myself onto the face when the easiest most obvious line climbs at 12d. Overall, a good climb and pretty steep for Boulder Canyon.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree with the comment that not using the right wall at all bumps this grade to 13a, though it is highly contrived not to use it. According to popular folklore the route was previously rated 12d and was forced right into the corner because there was no bolt on the face to go straight up.  Now a bolt is added and we have a great but a bit contrived route.

    This is a terrific crack climb - maybe one of the best in the canyon. The shift to the right for the top hand crack detracts slightly from the route but otherwise, it's well worth the trip to this wall, not to mention the other nice sport routes to add in.

    For decades this route was known as the Right Side. It was first climbed in 1961 by Kor and Northcutt. It was part of the Black Widow trilogy: Left Side, Center and Right Side.  It has been documented as such since 1967 in all of Pat Ament's BC guides and Jim Erickson's classic Rocky Heights.  It was graded 5.8 in the first High Over Boulder (1967) and stayed there through the second HOB and through 5.10, the Ament Erickson guide.  It was upgraded to 5.9 in Rocky Heights (1980).  The name change was initiated in the mid - late '90s, apparently to make it consistent with the stoner theme adopted at the crag. It seems kind of a shame to rename one of the first routes in Boulder Canyon. Hopefully the original name will see a resurgence.

    This is a really fun trad route.  It climbs much better and more difficult (I thought) that it appears it will.  Two roofs take you to a still sustained and tricky overhanging dihedral, after which it eases up considerably for the last 30' to the anchors.    Well worth pursuing.

    I placed a bolted anchor about 80' up this route after talking to the first ascentionist (Dan Hare) and getting his permission and encouragement.  I went and climbed this route a month or two ago (before putting in the anchor) and experienced the annoying lichen encrusted, unprotected, 5.4 bushwhack to the grassy ledge.  From the grassy ledge you had to either summit the formation (i.e. several more [pitches] of 5.? bushwhacking) or do a scary 50' downclimb to the top of one of the sport climbs on the right side of the formation.  The first 80' feet of this climb is fantastic, and the rest sucks!  There are three other trad routes on the crag.  One has a bolted rappel station at the top and the other two are obscure and dirty and don't look to have been done since Kor and Northcutt did them in '61.  I recognize that these anchors are a change to an existing route.  I debated putting them in.  I don't agree with putting in bolts to avoid a runout that was done by the first ascentionists or more generally changing the nature of a route to eliminate the boldness that used to be required to complete a route.  But I believe this is different.  Anyone who can climb the 10d to get to the new anchors, could easily finish the route.  This is not about avoiding a significant challenge that is an integral part of the route.  I actually placed the anchors as high as feasible to force a bit of runout 5.8/5.9 face climbing before the climbing deteriorated to a dirty slab.This is a convenience anchor.  It is easy to argue against convenience anchors, as many have (appropriately) in places like Eldo.  But I felt that these anchors are in character with the rest of the crag, and, apparently, so did the first ascenionist.  It is obvious that I am a little conflicted about this anchor, as evidenced by this lengthy explanation.  I don't like the spread of Sport Park ethics into the rest of the Canyon.  If there is significant and valid opposition to these anchors I will remove them myself.

    The route is 5.6 for the last pitch and maybe a 10' section of the second pitch.  It says on here to bring up to a 4.5" cam.  The biggest piece I placed was a #2 Camalot.   You could place a 4.5" piece but, it does not seem necessary.  I free soloed the 1st pitch.  It is quite easy.  There are bolt anchors at the top of the 1st and second pitch.  The descent starting down from the Erickson's Crack anchor was easy to do with 3 single rope raps.

    I don't know.  P3 is fun.  P2 is a VERY tight chimney... didn't think it was that fun (probably depends if you like that type of climb or not).  I lead P1 and had to convince myself a few times to put pro in... was really easy.

    P2 makes the effort worthwhile--it's a nifty pitch tunneling up through the chimney with good jams, sidepulls and body friction. Pro is good throughout.    The leftmost corner/crack on P3 was nice, as is the traverse that follows. Not a super-exciting route, but it's a good tour of the Blob.
    Jun 1, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    On the last pitch, there are two routes possible, the one to the right is slightly more difficult and is more of a chimney.  If you choose the left route, which it appears most do you have to traverse slightly right at the top of the pitch, there is a massive hold which is difficult to spot from below but if you commit you've made it.  The previous chimney is also fun and offers the left and right chimney options.  This climb is fun but no jewel by any means.

    The start can be done to the R with a short, tricky 5.7 OW flare that, oddly enough, does not require an OW move.  With a 60m rope, you can pass the 40ft anchors (of Cold Fusion) &amp; the 165 ft anchors, to reach the 185 ft anchors on P1.  It may be more enjoyable to go R on P2 &amp; do P3 of On Ballet.

    First pitch is relatively uneventful.  The second pitch is however very fun with some thoughful airy moves and there are a few route variations to choose from.

    Bit scabby, so four stars might be a stretch. Otherwise a classic "Tiny Dancer" affair. It's completely reasonable to climb the  route as one pitch (and worthwhile, since the "second" pitch is not trivial). With a 70 meter rope, it's just !barely! possible to lower from the top of the route back to the base.    No gear is needed for the belay area, it's expansive and comfortable.    A red C3 is nice below the first anchor (seemed like an offset yellow/red X4, or blue/yellow Metolius would be ideal).    A #0.3 C4 and/or #0.4 C4 before the first bolt on the "second" pitch.    And a #0.75 C4 and #0.5 C4 protect the last 25 feet.    No other gear is necessary.

    All the bolts on both pitches have been replaced. 100% of the holes were able to be reused. Thanks to the BCC for the hardware; please support them if you don't already. Note for later: the left bolt on the P2 anchor is mixed metal; the bolt is plated and the hanger/ring is stainless. I'm not sure when this particular bolt was replaced, but it was probably done by Mark Rolofson in the early 2000s when he bolted the project to the left. That bolt will need upgrading long before all the others. The pins were also tapped back in.

    My comment was not in any way intended as a dig at Steve, nor did I think his comments a sandbag.  I was trying to get at the nature of how to tackle the nearly vertical smears. I was breaking in a pair of Mad Rocks, and they just seemed too stiff to balance the need for some edging and a whole lot more smearing. The Miura sounds good. Even on a nearly vertical wall, if you intend to smear, then those heels will need to drop. That means milking the "edges" off the side of the shoe.  I think that the other point is this. If you are looking for a project somewhere in this difficulty range, then Radlands would be a bad choice. It is just too hard to work those sharp crimps in any more than a couple of trys. By contrast, the harder lines at Security or Anarchy Wall in Clear Creek won't wreck your hands and will be nearly as inspiring as Radlands (well, not quite). Moving quickly through the crimps seems to be important. The opening is awkward, but it won't wreck you. That reduces the hard stuff to 20 to 25 feet on the slab, but this is all sharp stuff.  I don't know how Mark could be so enthusiastic about Radlands. As I was following him up this first pitch, I had to clean off the blood just to use the holds!!

    Even having done a lot of bouldering at Flagstaff, I still cut my finger badly on one of the sharp edges above the third bolt.  For what it's worth, I wore Miuras for the redpoint - seemed to edge and smear equally well.

    A note on gear for the first pitch:  There are 2 fixed pins before the first bolt, so no gear is needed low down.  I did get a pretty bomber off-set alien after the last bolt, before the anchor, and was glad to have gear for that final move.  Wear any shoes you want, but go bouldering at Flag for about a month to get those babyskin tips hardened up for the sharp crimps at the crux.  Pullup training won't help-just learn to trust your feet!  Great route!
    Jan 26, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    For someone interested in doing this difficult line, here is an impression from someone with aveage flexibility and mortal skin. We approached Radlands with benefit of Steve Levin's comments and would do things differently in the future. First, Radlands is a slab, steep, but still a slab. Rather than using edging shoes, I think a slipper with some edging capability is recommended. Most of the edges you will find will be worked as smears and not edges. The bite is off the edge and in the middle of the foot pad. Second, go when it is cool, not too cold. Third, the crux edges are highly unpleasant.  While Radlands may be a great tick, the climbing is not fun. One can find equally difficullt  and classic "slabs" on Devil's Head that won't leave your fingers a bloody mess. Last, good hip flexibility is important. The edges are too thin to pull hard on, which means that most of the motion is going to come from the legs and feet, so that means turn-out, like a dancer. Even then the edges will be unpleasant.  Frankly, I cannot imagine how this route would exist without chipping off the patina to reveal the microedges that it does have, and that means exposing clean, sharp edges that wear relentlessly on the tips. My hat is off to someone who can walk up to Radlands and just do it, however, if you are looking for something in this difficulty range, then there are other local climbs that would make the experience more enjoyable.

Joyce led the first pitch with no falls and no hangs, and I managed as well on the second pitch.  All the bolts were placed by myself, as usual.

    I see that Bob D is slyly giving me some grief for getting scared. Well, I'm nowhere near an 11d climber, but I have gotten up some "11c" sport routes (a sly dig at some of Bob's ratings at Plotinus) in good style, and also the nearby Y2K (supposedly 11d) clean. So I thought I'd give Bearcats a try. I consider myself a mid-10 trad climber, and a lousy slab climber. I hate having to rely on my feet, and I freak if I don't have anything for my hands.  That's from learning to climb in the Gunks and spending most of my long climbing career there.

    For history's sake, where were the original locations of the bolts? Looking at the Rossiter topo it looks like there was a bolt at the start of the upper hard slab climbing (at the present 5th bolt), then one at the crux (present 7th bolt), and then some fixed stuff in the seams below the anchor.  Presumably the lower section was protected by RPs in the seam to the left of bolts 1, 2, and 3?

    Having just climbed this great route on Saturday, I thought the section between the 3rd and 4th bolts was a little spicy, but not serious, unless you seriously screw it up on the 5.4/5.5 waterdishes to clip the 4th bolt.  The 5.8ish mantle comes a few feet above the 3rd bolt.  For those who don't like runouts of any kind, the 11b first pitch of Divine Wind is perhaps better protected and is one of the best trad pitches in the Canyon.  Masochists who enjoy #3 Camalot sized jamming can finish on Wounded Knee, at a very hand-size-dependent 11b.

    WARNING: There is a 20' runout or so between the 3rd and 4th bolts. There are big scoops, but they are sloped. I got pretty gripped. Recovered, got gripped again, barely downclimbed. Then did a Houdini escape by hooking a chain of 3 long runners over a very dubious nubbin and monkeying down to the 3rd bolt. Coincidentally, shortly after this fiasco, I ran into Mark Rolofson, whom I had never met, and who did the FA in '82 with 3 bolts, and then retrobolted it in 2000. He was amused at my story, and said he has debated adding another bolt, but originally thought the retrobolted route should retain some of the spice of the original runout FA. He says the runout section is about 5.8, so for someit will feel casual. Mark promised to tell me if he adds another bolt, so that I can go back.

    This is described as a three-pitch climb in Bob D's guidebook to the canyon. We did the first two pitches as described there: climb Wildcat to its anchor, then go up a right-facing corner to a ledge, go right at an undercling (crux), then continue up to an undercling traverse heading right to another corner, go up the corner a few feet and then reach right to the Bearcat anchor. He rates it 10+ and that seemed about right; good gear the whole way (standard rack up to #3.5 Camalot).
    Jan 19, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Powerful and exposed, this route seems worth at least two stars! The crux roof pitch is short, but the exposure is wild, and the sustained nature of the climbing make it challenging for the grade.  The 1st pitch is harder than it looks too and high quality, but Bearcat is even better.

    If the jams at the start feel squirly to you (tight #3 camalot) then you'll be very unhappy if you didn't tape up.  I discovered this firsthand as I left a substanial chunk of flesh in the start of the crack.

I would be happy to go up there some time with you and finish the job.  I have a bunch of stainless hardware I am happy to contribute. I know that Dan would be stoked, too. It is a pretty good pitch!

    I didn't know what to expect with a comment like the "bolts are old and questionable, with the third being the best". Turns out that was a bit of an understatement. The first two bolts were buttonheads with Leeper hangers and the second one was half pulled and bent. I wouldn't have trusted it to hold body weight personally, let alone a lead fall. The third bolt was a wedge bolt with a thin SMC hanger that's collar wouldn't tighten in the hole with a wrench - it just kept spinning and wiggling and could be slightly pulled out of the hole with a quickdraw. But indeed, it was the best of the lot :)    Anyway, I replaced all three bolts and I attempted to replace the missing Fixed Pin as well. The new pin wouldn't really bite well and as it protects the finishing moves of the business, I was not confident in its longevity. I talked to Dan Hare (FA) about it and he encouraged replacing the pin with a bolt. Personally,  I'd be in favor of that as well.

    Yes, ssp, I'm old enough to take up golf, which could provide a solution to diminishing returns: handicap.  Once you've hoarded over 63 years, which I had when I flashed this route, you get to clip all the bolts.  (If not, you have to skip every other one.)  And for every year past 60, you may increase the rating by a letter grade (5.6b becomes 5.6c).  Another bennie:  The more I climb, the more easily entertained I am (5.6b seems as challenging in 2013 as 5.6c was in 2012).        What loose block?  Oh yeah....

    The third pitch as described here seems to have cleaned up enough to make it reasonable and fun to climb.  There is a left hand chip that flexes somewhere near where you reach out right to the rounded arete, maybe at 1/3 height.  That feature out left of the last bolt shifts.  It seems to be a detached bit of rock.  Not wanting to harm my belayer, I left it alone. Be careful not to pry it outward with your left hand or foot.

    Quite nice. A finger-sized cam protects the first move. A 9 or easy 10 move past the first bolt gets you to a ledge. You can place a #1/red Camalot in the ledge. One or two micro cams get you to the second bolt, but the cams may not be necessary since it's not that hard. The crux, at the second bolt, is essentially toproped. If you're going to toprope the second, place a #2/gold Camalot before angling left to the anchors.

    There is a new (to me) extended finish to this that goes a bit right and up some right-facing corners and aretes. It's quite fun and interesting, but it is a bit run out between the bolts.

    If Bolt Cola is a 10a, the crux of this felt like 10d unless I was missing something.  Even with the third bolt moved up a foot, I feel like nailing the ledge would be hard to avoid if you came off at the 4th.  Strenuous insecure moves on tiny freaking holds there unless I was missing something.  I used a 0.5 c4 between the 2nd and 3rd bolt, and then a 0.75 between the 4th and 5th.  Fun, but I doubt I'd volunteer to do it again.
    Nov 8, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    To add to what Bob said, sometime in the past we also moved the 3rd bolt a foot higher so that it will keep you off the ledge (see many comments above). Because of this, you may want to place a red Alien size at the ledge (over right) if you feel uncomfortable making the reach, as it is a stretch. Then unclip the piece to reduce rope drag.
    Jan 5, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Thanks for all the beta on the route.  We did put a locker on the 4rd bolt, but neither my partner Joe Chorny or I found the 4th bolt clip particularly bad or the bolt to be in that bad a spot.  Perhaps the key is to get the feet well established a little higher on better holds before making the clip.  True, the hand holds are the smallest on the route there but not too bad.
    Nov 19, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Focus on footwork when you pull into the roof as the handholds above don't inspire confidence. I probably made the 4th clip worse than needed, I ended up clipping across my chest with my right hand, strange positioning... whatever works...
    Oct 21, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I found the key to clipping the 4th bolt was to stand on a small edge with my left foot. So, after clipping the 3rd bolt, make the strenuous layback/undercling moves upward, keep the left hand on the undercling and move the right hand up to a pinch-type hold. At this point, your feet are maybe a little above the 3rd bolt. Just to the left of the 3rd bolt, there's a small edge for your left foot. Step over to that and stand up to clip the 4th bolt. I'm a little less than 5'5" and could do this pretty easily with a regular quickdraw. Don't fall while you're clipping or you'll land on that ledge! Once clipped at the 4th bolt, the next couple of moves up are fun.
    Oct 8, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    10a for the crux. Maybe the climb cleaned up a little bit, but the narrow stemming (close smears in the corner) made this climb OK, though the clip still did seem awkward.If Bolt Cola is 10a, this is 10b, but if Simmer and Shimmer are 9/9+, this is 10a, and Bolt Cola is 9-.
    Sep 20, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A committing and somewhat scary route.  The moves past the third bolt are strenuous, and the handholds leading to the fourth bolt aren't very good.  I felt there was a good chance I could blow the clip at the fourth bolt and land on the ledge below the third bolt, so I backed off.  This move deserves an R rating.    Edit: On 11/18/05, Bob D. moved the third bolt up a foot higher and a little to the right.  This provides better protection getting to the fourth bolt, and lessens the chance of hitting something if you blow the fourth clip.  The move up to the fourth bolt no longer deserves an R rating.

    I actually spied this route when Ray &amp; I rapped off Bolt Cola once and I told Bob to bolt it. By the time I got back to lead it, Ivan had made his initial post. Being in such bad shape, it had me quite scared. So I had my ED (Erection Device) with me. This is a foot long draw with a coathanger inside with a Genius carabiner on the top side (so you can reach up and clip hard to get at bolts). This allows you to do climbs without having to raise your ability level!  So as I get to the 4th bolt, I pull off ED, and I am actually too close to the bolt, and it confuses me, so I clip the wrong end onto the bolt. Now I can't get my rope into the Genius which has shut on me. So I have to take it off the hanger and put on a regular draw. It actually is not that bad. It could be located a little lower and right. I too did this again not too long ago and it did not seem unreasonable. But then I did not fall. Sport climbing is supposed to be "sporty" isn't it?? (Or is that Spooty?)
    Jan 26, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Did this again. The clip is still hard and still dangerous. My partner fell leading at the 3rd bolt and hit the ledge. So you'd hit the ledge really hard if you fell clipping the 4th bolt, unless you had the presence of mind, and the time, to push out. Maybe have a draw plus long sling pre-clipped to the rope for the 4th bolt. You might want some trad gear for the runout to the 5th bolt (assuming you're joining Bolt Cola). It's a long way, but easy. If you're not joining Bolt Cola, then you definitely need trad gear.
    Jan 26, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The locker was soothing, as Ivan suggests, and the clip isn't too bad with a draw on it (thanks Greg). Certainly the clip is the crux of the route. Most people connect up with Bolt Cola, but I noticed someone yesterday using Shorty as an indirect start to Where Eagles Dare.
    Jan 5, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is nice but short with one hard section. It's harder than Bolt Cola but less sustained. Clip the third bolt with a locking biner to minimize the chance of landing on the block below. Strenuous moves at the third bolt lead to a hard clip at the 4th bolt. This clip was the crux for me, but I may have positioned myself badly for the clip. Have a quick draw ready on your left side for this clip. After the 4th bolt the climbing is easy.

    The second pitch is not quite as bad using small cams (like Aliens, etc) and not passive pro, but maybe still be "R" because of the potential fragility of the placements near the end and the fall potential (falling is not recommended on this one).

    Did this climb with Joe Chorny yesterday.  On P1 the new bolts are nice to have, but if they weren't there, it would exciting 8+ or 9 over the roof's right hand side to the first gear placement.  The rest of the pitch felt like 8 or 9 and not 10a.  The white dike crux is protected well by 2 cams.  The v-slot move is cool and less exicting with a bolt at your waist.    I led P2 and thought is was more like 8+ or 9- and not 10 a or b.  I should know since I don't lead 10b trad!  This is nowhere near as difficult as P1 of Where Eagles Dare (solid 10b) and comparable to P2 and P4 of WED.  From the move up into the corner, the climb heads left out a small crack and up to the anchor.  We thought the climb went right, so we hand traversed across the face and around the arete but didn't see the anchor.  The bolted belay below the orange corner is up and left from the last belay and can't be seen until a few feet below it.  Good pitch - just short, only 50 ft or so.

    A fine route.  I felt the first pitch had two 10a cruxes: turning the roof at the second bolt, and climbing a bulge on the white dike halfway up the pitch.  There are some runout sections on this pitch, so get pro where you can.  I got a #1 Camalot in a shallow slot and a small wired nut to protect the tenuous moves past the bulge on the white dike.  The V-slot, slab, and hand traverse at the end of the pitch were lots of fun.    The second pitch is shorter but more sustained; the crux is a delicate step right (10a or 10b) to the left-leaning corner.  Fun layback and slab moves follow.  There is a two-bolt anchor just after the end of the corner/roof.    An excellent 11a bolted route starts from this anchor; I have added it to the database as "Bolted Orange Corner" (changed to Charisma).  It's well bolted and well worth doing; be careful of some crispy holds and friable rock.

    I would like to clear up some misinformation/history on this route. I re-climbed these routes twice (ones last week and once the week before that). I also tracked down first ascentionists, and asked several people that have done both The Reamer and Lichen to Like to clear this up. This pitch, as described here, is a new route known as Olympic Swimmer. It does cross Lichen to Like at about the 75-foot mark, just below the second retrobolt (hollow-sounding flakes). Lichen to Like keeps angling up and right along the crack system to gain the ledge at the higher of the two bolted anchors (where the still intact webbing nest is around the chockstone). We did not place any bolts on our ascent (lead or anchor). I am not a fan of retrobolts and while I recognize I did not publish our route on mountainproject, I did give the information to both Rossiter and D’Antonio for their respective books. Unfortunately the route never made it into D’Antonio’s books as Rossiter never updated his book (as of yet).

    Did it on Sunday. Probably shouldn't say this, but it was a pleasure to climb this on a weekend in the Canyon while just across the road Cobb Rock was busier than a one-armed paper hanger.    It is true, don't fall on P2, but a few thoughts I haven't seen posted here about that part of the climb:    1. There *is* small, flaring crack (like 2-3" wide) on the traverse over to the dike system that will take a good amount of air time off any fall in the dike system. Someone mentioned one at foot level, now, I *am* short, but this was clearly at chest/neck level for most people. It ate a green C3 and an Alien really easily, and while I was getting fancy with route finding (e.g. finding a way around the dike system), I took a lead fall on them and they held. It's a good placement if you just give it some attention.    2. The move into the dike system appears to be really scary/sketchy (at least to me and my partner). It's nothing we agreed we would have ever thought twice about and we've done moves like that so many times in the past without even thinking about it. But, there isn't very good recovery from losing your smear while you unweight the other foot to make the move (read: really, none) because the hands aren't wonderful here, and it is on the runout portion of the lead without good air below you to fall into (read: there isn't great air to fall into, not bad, but not a fall you want to take for fun, esp if you have previous falls to remind you of what happens when you fall in similar circumstances :). Anyway, the move into the dike system is nice, and once I did it I felt like a schmuck for being scared of it.     Anyway, hope my small yet wordy beta helps.

    I had fun climbing this yesterday in a single pitch with a 70m. I ran it out quite a bit to conserve gear and minimize rope drag. With a 60m I think the second would need to scramble up a ways on the very easy rock at the bottom.

    For posterity . . .a pretty good route and longish for Boulder Canyon to boot.  There were some bolts out left (part of another route, i suppose) for a slightly steeper start.  As stated above, small to medium cams are nice at the crux, runner them long and watch out for some loose rock getting out of the overhang.  There were a couple holds that probably shouldn't have had any chalk on em.  That's it.

    We climbed this as a party of three yesterday. We all concurred that the first pitch had the most difficult climbng on the route, maybe because the "crux" on pitch 2 is just so damn fun-!? Steep climbing, but clean moves on good holds made it seem no harder than 5.8 to me. We walked right at the top as described above by Ron Olsen and did one double rope rap with two 60 meter ropes and easily made it all the way to the ground.

    Must be getting old...but the pictures don't stir memories.  Nonetheless, if you don't like "walking off," you can rap from a good anchor L of the chimney at the start of the walkoff ledge to the 2 bolt anchor of P2 and then to the ground with 2 ropes.

    An alternative to the 3rd pitch is to climb "Erickson's Crack" up the vertical wall to the left.  This is rated 10c in Rossiter's guide and felt to me at least that hard.  This climb is not in the current database (I'd add it myself but I can't remember much more than this).

    An excellent climb with an inobvious line; almost as good as Bitty Buttress.  Take some time to study the route before you set off.    The first pitch has good pro at start and finish, but has an easy run-out slab in the middle.  The steep upper corner has some great stemming and an airy step left at the finish; solid 5.8 to 5.8+.    Traverse straight right to start the second pitch, and use small cams to protect the airy moves into the right-facing corner.  Lots of good holds keep this at 5.8, not 5.9.  The slab above is a little scary; you have to make several thin face moves with pro below your feet.  I got a #1 Camalot for pro before launching onto the slab. You can then get two finger-size cams for pro as you move left to the chimney.    The third pitch is short and leaves you on a big ledge; thread a block for a belay anchor.    The rappel descent described in a previous comment is the easiest way off.  Traverse right several hundred feet, passing an exposed section,  to the first rappel. Look for a bolt just above the ledge and two bolts with slings and rings just below the ledge.  The slings were replaced on 10/26/04 by Bruce Hildenbrand.    Rappel to a good ledge with another bolt anchor, and do a second rappel that drops you in the gully on the right side of the rock.

    P1 from the ground to the ledge felt like the crux to me.  While the start to P2 was difficult to protect there is no way this is 5.9..airy but not 5.9.  Two ropes *might* get one down to the top of Bolt Cola if you want to skip the last pitch or finish the climb, walk NE around the ledge to the rap anchor that puts you down near the start of Bolt Cola, 1x50m rope is plenty for this (2 raps)...The anchor is down and over the edge but there is a single bolt on the wall next to the ledge to offer some protection while threading the rope...slings are a little crispy (as of 8/3/02) and need to be replaced.

    We rapped off P1 of Where Eagles Dare a few weeks ago and got a look at this climb, and I thought, "Yeah, it looks like about 5.8." So we decided it would make a good warm-up climb today. 5.8 is a major sandbag in my opinion. Felt more like Where Eagles Dare (10c). Way harder than any of the 4 bolted climbs to the left or any of the trad 9s at Blob. But perhaps I was in shock at running into such hard climbing on what I expected to be a cruise. The only thing that got me up the pitch was my unwillingness to downclimb to the ground to clean my gear.    We approached the crux corner differently than described above. Rather than 'climbing the first 40 feet of unprotected slab on "Where Eagles Dare"' (disagree about the "unprotected" btw), we climbed right of the orange streak up a right leaning right facing groove and then angled left to the base of the corner. You could also climb straight up, left around a headwall and then slightly right to the same place (dirty and poor gear), or perhaps climb the headwall directly (cleaner but poor gear).    The crux is S due to the likelihood of hitting the slab. There is excellent gear at your feet when you get the first jug (I had 4 good pieces).    As for the "scary moves traversing back left into the corner", it sounds like Chris and Alex may have climbed up onto the slab right of the crux corner and then moved left. I considered that, but it looked way too scary. Maybe it's 5.8 that way? Instead I did some hard stemming to get the first jug. It took a long time to figure this move out. Then another hard move to get the second jug, which also was hard to figure.

    I like how the description says this route is possibly overbolted yet there's a 30ft run out without bolts...you can certainly place more than one cam in this section. Poor description and protection sections on this route's page.  It should also be changed to a sport/trad mix route. It's not a sport route.  I don't understand why the bottom portion of this route was bolted where there's obvious pro yet the top was not...either bolt the whole thing, or not at all. Yeah the climbing's easy up there, but a fall would be catastrophic.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    This really should just be described as the retrobolted first pitch of Astrophysics. Anyone that has climbed the Simmer/Slimmer/Shimmer/Bolt Cola routes knows there's not enough real-estate to shove in all these routes, and to quote Richard Rossiter's Rock Climbing Boulder Canyon book from 1999, "Climb the first 80 feet of Astrophysics...." Furthermore, Rossiter describes the first pitch of Astrophysics to start off a pointed flake (as D'Antonio describes the start to Bolt Cola). Rossiter goes on to say climb the 7 bolts and that in the FA info, the "bolts on the first pitch were placed by a subsequent party". Dan Hare has even said this is a retrobolt of his original line. (The same flake is described for Astrophysics in Rossiter's 1988 guide Boulder Climbs North too.) The FA line should read FA: Dan Hare, Mike Downing, 1987, retrobolted by Ken Trout, 1994. I recognize D'Antonio's guide suggests starting Astrophysics just left of Bolt Cola. However, the bolts are only five feet right of Simmer so....    Seems crazy people are so accepting of not only retrobolting an established line but also the renaming of it. This has bugged me for a long time, but with the retrobolting of some routes a bit left (see David Schwimmer, et al), I felt the need to chime in. Even those routes, which I am credited with as an FA for on this site, were not my FAs as the leftmost two are partly bolted versions of the first pitches of The Reamer and Lichen to Like. Does history not matter anymore? I recognize a route is first done by an individual and some see it as "their route" while others view all routes as communal, and we could all go round and round about the retrobolting debate, but still, I'm not sure I know anyone who, even when in favor of adding retrobolts, feels it appropriate to also rename the route and claim the "new" first ascent of that line.

    Thought this was a fun route and does have some thoughtful 5.10ish moves.  But not knowing where the next bolt was at the roof I headed left thinking I could protect the crack with a cam.

Pulled myself together and went back up and this time went right, much easier that way and I thought I was wimping out, but I guess that is the way the route goes!

    This is the easiest route in this area to identify because you start by stepping off a spike of rock.  You can't see the last bolt from the 6th bolt (at least we didn't), so without this knowledge we "bailed" left, where you can get some gear in.  After placing another small cam you can wander up and right to the chains (looks tricky but is not), or head left for the anchor on "Shimmer".    Down low, there are several ways to get between the bolts so it's kind of hard to rate.  No way is this route 5.8, though!

    Actually more like 1 1/2 * ; good , but really outstanding.    [Definitely] over-rated at 5.10 and would probably go at 5.8 in Shelf.    There is a bit of a run-out to the anchors (but it is pretty easy), a couple of 3/4" to 1" cams would help steady down a leader used to an "over-bolted" routes.

    Variation of Fear:  Not knowing where (Read: if) that bolt was on the R side of the roof, I went left and protected the flake/crack with a couple of stoppers.  You can then head left to the other set of bolted anchors, or proceed R to the intended anchors.

    I've led this route without using the bolts, and there is only one place where I felt the pro was not great, and that was up high, under the roof, just before you get to easier ground (and good pro again).

    I would like to clear up some misinformation/history on this route. I re-climbed these routes twice (once last week and once the week before that). I also tracked down first ascentionists and asked several people that have done both The Reamer and Lichen to Like to clear this up. This pitch, as described here, is a new route known as Pool Skimmer. It does cross Lichen to Like at about the 60-65-foot mark, just below the second retrobolt (below the shallow groove). Lichen to Like keeps angling up and right along the crack system to gain the ledge at the higher of the two bolted anchors (where the still intact webbing nest is around the chockstone). We did not place any bolts on our ascent (lead or anchor). I am not a fan of retrobolts, and while I recognize I did not publish our route on mountainproject, I did give the information to both Rossiter and D’Antonio for their respective books. Unfortunately, the route never made it into D’Antonio’s books as Rossiter never updated his book (as of yet). In that regards, I do not blame the retrobolter for the bolts, but it would be nice to see them removed and patched.

We had a belay (rat's nest of slings around a block) to the left of the spike and traversed above the spike to get to the blind stopper placement. Well, I never actually got on this pitch because my buddy fell about a hundred times before getting to the stopper placement (seems like he was falling onto a bolt). When he finally managed to make it over, he put in a very small nut and decided to weight it to see if it might hold. Turns out the answer was no. His static body weight alone dislodged a large block which came crashing down and almost killed DP who was at a bolted belay one pitch down (that's another story...). DH fell onto the Reamer spike. He didn't get horribly hurt, but was feeling bad enough to call it a day. After getting off, DP and I had a fine time on the sport routes in the right gully. DH was content to take a bunch of vitamin I and just watch...

I belayed Leo up to the new two-bolt anchor, which is perfectly situated under the second pitch of under the Eagle's Wing, which he led next.  After doing the third pitch of Charisma, we rapped to the ground and toproped Resolution as described herein.

    We thought this climb was garbage. Maybe P3 is nice, if you like awkward overhung exposure. The description of Orange corner in the book is right, but the topo line shows center route, so we tried to link the center route to get to the 2nd anchor on the big ledge. These pitches were very run out, the gear was shit, and the climbing wasn't spectacular. Luckily, using doubles could reduce the heinous link-up meandering. The P1 anchor has only one hanger. We didn't continue up pitch 4, because we wanted to get off of this terrible route after P3, and there were nice anchors right there after the hand crack.

    I would recommend running this in two pitches. P1 - ground to the top of the .8 runout section (skip intermediate bolted anchor), and belay at a bolted anchor just under the big roof. P2 run to the top. We carried a #4 but didn't use it.  Felt the crux was well-protected with a #5 or so, BD stopper at your chest and a red Alien at your knees when you leave the jug. Not sure if we were on the right route for the final pitch, but it was definitely not .8. 15 feet of steep 0.5 Camalots to 15 feet of steep 0.75s. Great climbing.    There is a new rap anchor climber's left of the finish about 40 feet. With a 70m, you can reach the anchor at the top of guidebook P2 (before the hand traverse).  Not a great pull, but our rope came clean. A single 70m rap then gets you to the ground. I doubt a 60m would reach on either rap.

    I just did this route. Great route. I feel like these posts understate the nature of the first pitch crux which at 5'10" I found extremely hard and scary. Once stemmed in the dihedral, you are on a massive rail which actually has a small flake on it. I slung this flake which I felt was better than the placement. Situated in here it is pretty casual, but I probably stemmed there for over 10 minutes trying to figure out how to pull the crux. You are way above your gear on a slabby mantel that if you blew it you would deck on the slab below the crux dihedral. This is a very serious pitch. To put it into perspective for you, I felt this was scarier than Super Slab, 10d, Northwest Corner, 11a, X-M, 10c which I have led mutliple times.    The rest of the route was fun, especially the hand cracks after turning the corner.

    Did this with Brian today. First of all, awesome climb. It seems to me that everyone has a different experience on this climb. I found the crux of the route for me to be the hand crack leaving the large detached "eagle's nest" flake. However, I suck at all kinds of crack except for my specialty... thin tips. The thin overhang was one move of 5.10a followed by a decent rest to a strange stemming/manteling sequence that just felt a little balancey.    The second pitch was super exciting. I placed about four small, decent pieces right in a row on the left before launching out into the cool sequence on the face to the right. I apparently was having too much fun, because I missed the cam placement on the arete and didn't place until I was about to exit the RF corner, circa~8 ft below the 2nd pitch belay. I love fiddling in RPs above a twenty foot runout. An excellent route.

    Great route! P2 was my favorite, but I found the crux in the first pitch easier than some parts of the sustained hand cracks on P3.  Loads of fun none the less.

    Finally I can say I climbed a really good trad line in BC.  Found it a bit harder than expected.  Not sure if my 5 day fast and losing 13lbs had anything to do with it.  But, the first pitch crux felt quite stiff, well protected though.  The second pitch is the mental crux, thin slabby climbing with intermittent "ok" gear.

    I agree with Guy, and here is an excellent 4 pitch variation that captures the best parts of Main Wall:    P1:  Climb Bolt Cola to the anchors (10a), 25m.  P2:  Lead directly up the white face above on small pro to the prominent traverse rail.  Clip a single cold shut, and hand rail across for 20m to the regular belay at the base of p3 of Where Eagles Dare (8+), 30m.  P3:  Climb the beginning of the third pitch and belay at the first set of ring anchors, just past the handcrack (10a), 15m.  P4:  Climb the rest of the third pitch to the big ledge (10a), 25m.    Just below and climber's right of the top out are a set of rap anchors for a 25m rappel to ring anchors at the base of Decade Dance, then 25m rappel to the gully.

    This is one of the best multi-pitch climbs in BC.  Every pitch has something unique to offer.  The 10b pitch is well protected and straightforward, if you are tall.  The second pitch is quite heady, since the crux is protected by a #000 C3 cam.
    Jan 5, 2008

    Rob    I don't recall which way the cam went in.  Not a spot to hang around at very long.  P2 and the others are much easier than P1 so give it a try if you at the top of P1.

    Climbed this yesterday with Joe Chorny.  We both thought this route was great.  Here are some comments for what they are worth.    Joe led the first pitch and placed a small nut in the right hand hold needed to pull your feet up into the dihedral.  Placing this nut was a long reach, strenuous and required a few tries and some rests in between.  The first pitch still has the fixed nut at the top of the crux dihedral.  Joe also got a good nut below this and slung the jug horn.      I led the second pitch and thought the gear was mediocre.  One could place cams in the pin scars but these would take away the only handholds.  I placed a marginal nut in the btm of the larger hold to leave some room.  Before making the traverse right a small nut/RP can be placed in the thin crack on the left.  Placing the small cam in the horizontal (#0 Friend) wasn't that bad, but the move after that was the hardest.  I traversed straight right to the arete and found quite a bit of lichen, perhaps up a move or two and then to the arete is the right way.  As for the potential fall on the belay, the belayer could tie in with a few feet of rope and then swing to the right out of harm's way if the leader falls near them.    On the 3rd pitch Joe and I both hand traversed the lip with feet down low instead of trying to grovel sideways.  The #4 Camalot is very nice to have here.  If you're tall (I'm 6" 2"), you can place or clean the #4 from the belay.  The short crack after the grovel is also 9, steep with smooth feet but good jams.    The last pitch was 8-8+ and very nice.  It is good to have 3 or more cams in the 0.5-0.75" Camalot size for the middle and upper part of the crack.  I ran out of those and had to overcam a #1 Camalot in the final crack.     From the top, traverse 10-15 feet right to a bolted anchor.  There is also a single bolt on a boulder a few feet above this anchor.  From there, 2 single rope raps will get you to the ground.
    Nov 6, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There's a fixed nut to protect the P1 real crux moves after the jug. The nut has been there over a year. It's been tested... P2 is spicier than I remembered. The small cam in the horizontal is tough to place and very shallow, hanging in on a bump in the crack.
    Dec 17, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    We got on this route today, mid-40s with a frigid, biting wind, so we rapped off at the second set of anchors, frozen. The move into the P1 crux corner can be very well protected, but be sure to dress your runners so that they're out of your way as you pull up into the corner. Once you reach the jugs above, the real crux begins... don't miss the #00 Metolius TCU to your right which Jon Sargent mentions above, the only pro as you stem high and wide using thin crimps to get you up onto the slab. Be sure to place a small stopper as you head right above to the anchors to protect your second from a big swing. We will be back to finish this route!
    Nov 19, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    We also did a variation on the second pitch (see Jake's comments above). From the anchor at the top of the first pitch, continue the traverse right. There are some decent finger underclings, and you can get a medium cam in, then it heads up after about 12-15 feet. The rock seems a bit brittle here in places, and it's fairly dirty, but slam a small wire in and head up and it's worth it. You will gain an arete from which you can see your belayer again--s/he's right below you--and you can get in your smallest cam for pro. Easy climbing from here to the ledge beneath the third pitch. I thought this was to be the most exciting pitch, but then I went on to climb the rest of the route, which continued to be fantastic. Good stuff! Three stars! Look for the rappel slings to the right to save the walk....
    Jan 4, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    More gear info:    At the crux, place a big brass nut. Anything bigger interferes with the finger jam. After the first hard move, you can place a medium stopper on the right edge of the bucket. This is good for a straight out pull, but the rock could break. Above is a small brass, #2HB offset? Use long draws, because as you stem the corner you are pulling straight out on these nuts. If you are as stressed out as I was, you might consider the following two placements: Where the dihedral meets the slab there is a tiny "V" slot. You can place a medium HB (#5?) sideways. After you step up left you can get a good aluminum HB offset (#8?) to your left at hip level. Use a long sling. A regular nut probably wouldn't work here. Can you tell I like the HB offsets? I really like the aluminum bigger ones. I've been using the smaller brass ones since they came out. I also really like the offset cams. I was given the 3 smallest Metolius offset cams for a present and use them all the time.    The second "9s" pitch is more like 8pg. You can get good cams in the corner and a tiny cam in the horizontal as you move right. Another cam on the arete and a brass nut back left in the corner makes this very safe.    For the "crawl" pitch, a #4/purple Camalot would make it very safe. Smaller cams can be placed further left, but you would be facing a ledge fall, or worse if your foot gets stuck and you land on your head. If this pitch is 10a, it must be the crawl that is the crux. The hand crack is very easy.    There are two new bolts at the end of the hand crack that you can rap to the ground from with a 60m rope. It felt a little silly to do the crawl and then rap, but we were cold.
    Dec 21, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    From the ground, this climb just looks ok; however it is great, a must do in my opinion.  The last pitch looks like a walk up after the short hand [crack] section, but there is good climbing from top to bottom.
    Sep 29, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Great route! I would suggest doing it in two pitches, [especially] linking one and two. A fall on the second pitch would send the leader directly into the belayer. As for the crux, I was able to protect the initial move into the corner with a solid # 3 RP placement and found what was a solid #00 TCU (grey) placement to [protect] the move exiting the corner. 1 long [rappel] with a 60 meter rope (the anchor is slings, climber's right after topping out) and a bit of down climbing gets you to the gully where Jolt Cola is located.
    Sep 23, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Great route.  Stiff for even the 10b rating.  You can definitely get a wire or Alien in the crack at the crux.  It's strenuous.  It's a wee bit awkward &amp; committing to move up onto the slab.  The second pitch can definitely be protected on good gear with wires, Aliens.  It's a long way to walk off this bugger.
    Mar 5, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Jake Martin-- There are some great variations that make this climb go at 9+ or 10a.  As described in George's description, at the first pitch crux, you can go up a weird hand traverse left(the route Center Direct), clip a bolt and then move up and right to the bolted belay.  This is kind of runout, but climbs on fairly easy slab.   At this point, (the belay) you can go up the 9s corner, left on two bolts, or the variation we did, which is traverse directly right.  A bomber yellow alien comes 10 feet off the belay, then continue right on some balancey slab (more bomber gear--keep your eyes open) until you see the a bolt line running up  (this bolt line is also visible from the belay)  on the right side of the crack/block that is usually accessed from the left (via the normal route).  These bolts are only 5.9.  Follow them until you reach the crack and onward to the top!

    Not sure the lower section of the route will ever clean up nicely, but I managed to pull off the right hand sidepull/pinch block @ the 3rd bolt. The left hand undercling used to get to the block will likely go at some point, as well as the large flake shared with Vaso, especially the way it's loaded for elephant.    It still looks climbable, albeit likely harder; I had no interest trying though.

    Agreed. Very sustained and bouldery. A bit chossy compared to its popular neighbor, but it should clean up nicely with more people climbing on it.

    I led the first ascent of this climb in 1985. It had a fixed copperhead &amp; fixed nut to start.  From the crux at 4th bolt up to the finish on a big ledge, the climb was protected by removable gear placed on lead. The exact piece had to be placed correctly from a strenuous position. I led it after top roping it &amp; inspecting the gear on rappel.    By 1993, the poor fixed gear was gone. I decided to retro bolt it, as it had seen very few ascents, but has very interesting climbing. It is far better as a sport route. The original finish that climbed a moderate large detached flake leading to the big ledge, is avoided as a sport route. It joins Jolt Cola instead.

    Really powerful climbing for most of the route.  Quite a bit harder than JC next door. Small gear at the top not a bad idea,  I didn't have any.  Must have been one heck of a ride back in the day with only 2 bolts!  yikes!
    Dec 21, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree, this a great climb and much harder in my opinion than its neighboring climb, Jolt Cola (direct start), which is also rated 12a.  As you know, getting to the first bolt (w/o the gully stem) requires 5.11 climbing on somewhat dirty, lichen-covered rock, with the first bolt well above the talus-filled gully.  Stemming across the gully is still somewhat sketchy and it eliminates the first 10_15 feet of face climbing.  In my opinion, the climb would be vastly improved by adding a bolt to the start.  I understand that it was originally led on gear in 1985 and subsequently retro-bolted in 1993 by Mark Rolofson.  Normally, I would never want to retro-bolt a climb originally led on gear; however, since it's retro-bolted already, I though it would be an improvement to add a bolt and not mess around with stick clips, gully stems, and unnecessary risk.  The climb already has a _spicy_ run-out between bolts 3 and 4, and 4 and 5; therefore, I don't feel the nature/character of the climb would be altered.

    Both quality and difficulty assessments are compared to other one pitch Boulder Canyon sport climbs.  This pitch attains surprisingly exposed postion while its difficulty increases with each bolt. Could be very photogenic from the Conan's ledge.  Very closely bolted in the upper section -- watch out for z-clipping.    Note: the gully at the base is currently quite loose.  Be very careful in it if there are people around the base of Jolt Cola and nearby routes.

    Well worth the short, steep hike. There are excellent footholds almost wherever you want them. I found no fewer than four no-hands rests, as well. Soft? Hard? Grades seem insignificant on routes with such high-quality movement. Felt harder in the rain, if that answers the difficulty question.

    Link it into the roof above for a fun full-value pitch!  Might want to rig a tension rap to save your rope though... anyone know what that upper roof pitch is?  is it P2 of this or another name?  thanks!
    Nov 13, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a difficult route to onsight and is much easier the second time.  I tried P1 a couple of years ago and took many hangs working through the crux.  Yesterday I tried again and remembered enough to RP relatively easily.  After clipping #3, I tend leftward and then move both feet up and right to set up a layback.  Palming the small, right-facing (and somewhat downward-pointing) dihedral with the right hand, I layback up onto the right foot; then I can clip #4.  A delicate foot match and right stem allows you to reach the right crack.    This time I also attempted the super-pumpy roof extension,  which you can do in one pitch and still reach the ground with a 60m.  After clipping #2, I entered the roof by reaching up with the right and getting the tips onto the block.  I didn't see the "hidden jug" for the left hand mentioned in the captions of the photos.  After clipping #3 from the block, I could get the right fingers into a poor crack at the top of the roof and stand on the block.  It's still hard to get over the roof, as I found after sliding off.  A stem with right foot gets you over.
    Aug 28, 2008

    Only did first pitch, sun going down and pretty cold.  We did leftish variation between 3rd and 4th bolt.  Odd bolt placements here kind of throw off the flow.  There were several chalk dots where it almost looks like somebody is thinking of moving the 3rd and 4th bolts slightly left.  This would kind of improve the climbing as the clipping wouldn't detract quite so much.  First pitch felt pretty accurately graded in Rolofson's guide at 11c/d.  Tricky, technical, but nor really too pumpy.    I'd give first pitch 3 stars.  4 stars if 4th bolt (in particular) was moved to the left about a foot.  Good times!

    My buddie, Aaron Cloud, and I did this route the other day and were both well impressed with its quality.  Well it is an excellent climb, the direct version (going straight from bolt to bolt, in good obedient sport climbing style) never felt harder than 11d.  After every hard sequence, which were never more than 2 or 3 moves long, there was an jug to shake out on. A great climb and a good warm-up for the harder routes up the gully.
    Jul 17, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The right variation on the lower half (11c) makes for more varied climbing--a traverse right then back left once again towards the third bolt... Watch out for a hard fast pendululum if you come off! I disagree with the route description--that there aren't many good holds--there are. And when you figure out the sequence, it goes nicely. A definite three star climb in my book!
    Jan 4, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I just want to echo how great this route is. It's rare to find a route that is fun, quality, and has you thinking from the very first move to the very last...and both variations of Jolt Cola offer exactly that. The 12a variation has harder single moves, but the 11c path (to the right) is more sustained. Great climbing. One option is to lead the 11c variation, then set up a TR on the 12a on the rap if you don't feel like leading the 12. Awesome route! (Oh, and the ratings feel accurate to me, if anyone gives two squats).
    Oct 21, 2002

    Excellent route, it's not harder than 12a, especially when compared to Respite, The New Ticket, or Ginseng Rush on Blob.  I think the Rolofson guide book still calls the direct start 11c, which might be a little soft.  Either way, a great pitch on clean granite.

    Excellent tech fest which seems dubiously hard on the first go.  Linking both pitches is my recommended approach, however, beware of rope drag in the crack above the roof while lowering off ( rap probably best ).  Fun and sustained, it will feel much steeper than it looks....
    Dec 20, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Yeah, you can keep going through the roof. I was way too pumped to even consider it by the time I got to the anchors. Supposedly (according to Rossiter) you can climb to the right below the third bolt and avoid the crux. I haven't tried it that way, though. I'd say it's harder than a number of the 12b or c routes at Clear Creek, so an accurate grade might be closer to 12b. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it, unless someone thinks of a better excuse for the butt-kicking I got on this route. Good to hear that at least one other person thought it was hard.
    Nov 5, 2001

    I think there is an extension which makes for a really long pitch through a roof at the top. I agree with the rating but there are apparently two ways to do it, on the right being "easier."

    This route is very underrated given its close location to both Jolt Cola and Vaso. The left-facing corner in the middle of the route is beautiful, clean granite with fun moves and cool holds.  I used this as my warmup for Vaso virtually everytime. In my opinion, it gets an extra star for the center section alone. Also, I'm not sure about the route years ago, but it seems to climb cleaner than everyone describes it to be. Maybe with constant traffic, as a large number of people use this as a warmup for both Jolt Cola and Vaso, that it has cleaned up some and will continue to get better. All in all, not a bad route and worth getting on if you're in this sector....

    Joe Collins said:  I disagree that this is 11d, even by modern Boulder Canyon standards.    Joe's done tons more hard sport climbs than I have, but I've done a lot of the modern 11a's and b's. Orange Crush is harder than all of those 11a's and b's I've done (eg, Scientist and Morpheous and others on Plotinus, the 11a's and b's on Sleeping Beauty, Free Willie and others at Animal World), Divination and Hunky Monkey on Lost Angel, Rush and Rage Against the Machine on Wakeup Wall), Schizofrantic on E. Blob (to list more than a few). Also felt Orange Crush was harder than Hike for Y2K on Blob Slab, rated 11d.    If you're comparing to Eldo or Boulder Canyon trad standards, then I'd certainly agree with Joe.    The ratings are pretty messed up in Boulder Canyon, even comparing just Boulder Canyon sport with Boulder Canyon sport, not to mention comparison with Eldo (which is tricky due to the difference between trad and sport).

    An excellent, thought provoking climb.  The crux is difficult to read on the onsight, but becomes quite reasonable once you know what to do.  it felt like 12a on the onsight due to the inobvious nature of the crux, but dropped to 11c on repeat ascents once you know what to do.  Doing the route in one pitch is the way to go. 98' to the anchors.There is a hidden bolt just above the handcrack and before the first bolt in the bulge.  Knowing this reduces the need for the 3Friend/ gold camalot.

    Very tricky climbing.  I found this route to be harder than the Ticket, Jolt Cola, and Bearcat goes to Hollywood.  The crux can be climbed as a stem problem or a layback off the seam.  The stem variation may be easier if you are short enough to get in that position.

    Funky and awkward footwork in the crux. The trick seems to be one of laying away a knob with right and pulling up and into a narrow dihedral, loosing the good feet that preceded. Fourth clip is committing, but after that the line is stitched tight. Decent but not great.

    Some additional info:  pitch two is worth doing.  Linking P1 &amp; P2 works well, but  use an extra long sling at the 3rd bolt.  In fact, it's probably a good idea to have a few full length (24") slings.  There is an unbolted handcrack on P2 where a gold Camalot works well.  The crux is at the roof, ~11a. Done as one pitch, there are 15 bolts to clip.A lower off from the P2 anchors barely makes it with a 60 meter rope.

    I just went up and did some climbing on this route the other day and didn't notice any major loose blocks. I think I know which hold everyone is talking about after reading the comments, but when climbing, it didn't feel loose or dangerous. I was just wonder if any work was done to glue or secure that block in place since those comments were posted or if I just didn't notice how loose it was while climbing. I'd love to work this climb, but if that block is as dangerous as some people seem to think it is, I might avoid the route and find a new project. Thanks in advance for any feedback on the subject.

    Just sent this on Saturday (May 16)! I have worked the route off and on for a couple years. Early on, I remember being able to wiggle the loose block when hang-dogging beside it, but it didn't wiggle when pulling down or hand-jamming to the right of it. This Saturday, I couldn't get it to wiggle at all. I didn't notice any glue or anything different about it. Maybe it's the time of year? Also, I think that removing the block could potentially make the route a bit easier, instead of harder, since it looks like it may result in a decent-sized scoop that may make for a better rest. Who knows. Either way, be mindful of the rock and your belayer below.    Shaun

    I established this route in December 1993. It is still one of the best first ascents I've done. It don't remember leaving any loose rock on the route. I did pull off a huge, 5 foot block at the base of the climb. I was worried as the block crashed downhill, but it stopped long before the road in talus &amp; boulders. The big concern about trundling here is making sure no one is walking up the hill. Pick a cold weekday, and rap in from above. Look to see if there are no cars in the parking lot. If you climb up the route and lower, then pull the rope up. Lower yourself. Move your belayer, gear, &amp; dogs way up the gully above "Hypertension", because rock can explode when in hits the wall or ground.   The last time I was on the route was 2008. I can't believe how popular it's become. Unfortunately there aren't more routes like it in the canyon.

    I did this route years ago, and I did it again recently. It was, is, and always will be super classic. It may be the best route in the canyon at any grade. It's very sustained, super pumpy and has back to back cruxes on bullet hard stone. I agree, there are sneaky rests all over it. Don't be cheating and hanging a 4 foot runner from the top of the egg, taking that fun and airy whip is what makes the route! My first redpoint years ago I skipped that last bolt at the top of the crux and ran it out to the top.  Big whip potential and nothing short of exciting... and to the loose block debate, this has been loose from the beginning. Nothing has come off or ever will come off, and the route has seen thousands of ascents. This route is probably one of the best in country at the grade. Do it and you will see....
    Nov 1, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    "Would love to hear from someone who has been on the route both years back and recently to see if the block has gotten looser."    Yes, the block is loose compared to 2003, and to be honest, I do not even remember it being an issue back then. I suspect that if it comes off it might cause serious harm to the belayer and anyone else in the gully.  Looking at the fall line, it would likely hit the ledges below the first bolt and either bounce across and/or break-up into more pieces.    Losing the block will result in a harder line. The block is used to initiate the second of three cruxes on the face, without the block I do not know what will be available for feet.

    Slim is exactly correct about gluing.     In general, if you want to glue something, you really need to get both bonding surfaces very clean or the glue job won't last and then you have made a real mess that is really hard to clean up. The best case scenario usually involves removing the piece of stone if possible so that you can get into all of the little crevices, etc. and thoroughly clean all of the surfaces. You then let everything dry well and only then do you apply the glue. If you have never done this, please don't make this your first attempt. Moreover, once this thing is off, the best thing to do would probably be to figure out whether not having the hold drastically changes the climb. If it does, well then you can go about reattaching the piece if need be.     If folks really think this needs to be dealt with, then perhaps some experienced volunteers will come forward to help figure this out. Until then, please don't go up there and squirt two tubes of glue into a dirty crack.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Slim's answer to the loose block is most likely the best. We have used this process in other places where a trundle would cause considerable harm. 250 lbs is not an excessive load for a lowering belay from the top anchors. It has worked out best for us to redirect the ground belay through a one or two biner system that takes the load off the belayer and serves as 3:1 pulley system. One person climbs up and lowers to the block, places the bolt/hanger, and clips themselves off above the block and off the top anchor (in the unlikely event that it blows). A static line is best for lowering the block so that when it is pried off it will not generate the momentum that would arise from a lead line. The ground belayer then lowers the block using a Grigri.
    Jan 3, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    One possible method might be to drill a bolt into the rock and attach a hanger, then basically lower it off with a rope.  If Alex's size estimate is correct, it is probably around 250 lbs or so.  If you cut this thing loose, it could pinball down the gully and then shoot down the hillside (maybe to the road, not a lot of trees to stop it).
    Jan 3, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I third the comments regarding the loose block, it's as sketchy as any block I've seen on a well-traveled route.  It's definitely headed to the ground one way or another, might even happen with another freeze-thaw cycle.  While it may change the route considerably when it comes off, I'm not convinced that it could be safely fixed to the wall by glue or bolt.  It looks to me as though it's likely to head straight at the belayer if it gives way (the rope also diagonals directly across it).     I propose trundling as safely as possible.  It would be nice to have some community weigh-in to reach a consensus on the matter.    Exercise caution if you do elect to climb on the route while it's still in place.
    Jan 2, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree with Alex's post about the loose chunk of rock. It is really sketchy (just knock on it) and will probably come off sometime soon. I think trundling it will dramatically change the route and make it waaay harder. Trundling the rock is also really unsafe unless there are spotters below making sure no one is hiking anywhere nearby. I think bolting it to the wall is the best bet, but some Boulder Canyon chossaneers might have a better idea.

    Hadn't been on Vaso since '97 or so...and yes, I think a couple well used holds aren't there anymore. Speaking of loose holds, a big heads-up to any future suitors - in between the 5th and 6th bolts is a BIG timebomb ready to go! It's the last good rest before getting up into the scoop/shelf crux. You can right hand-jam and left wrist wrap the block to rest, clip the 6th, etc. It could cut your rope, take out your belayer, and definitely wipe out anyone lower in the gully like bowling pins. I'm not a huge proponent of glue, and I don't think it will work anyways. The block is 100% fractured entirely around (36"x12"x6"?) and will move if you try to rock it. We could pry the whole thing off, but I'm certain it will dramatically change the climb (but nature is not timeless anyways). Bolt it to the wall with a 10" bolt? Ha, isn't there some other climb in BoCan that has that?? Anyways, there you have it. Tread lightly and watch out!

    The flake side pull between the 8th and 9th bolt gave way and is now gone. so instead of going out left you can mantle straight up from the clipping hold at the 8th to the clipping hold at the 9th. I don't think it changes the grade any. Happy sending.

    I was on Vasodilator in mid-December and haven't return since due to the recent snows.  At the time, there were draws in place on the whole thing, which is certainly convenient;  however, the draws are in truly horrific shape.  I've never been more certain that a quickdraw would break if I'd fallen on it.  A few of the draws are in decent condition, some questionable, and some down right life-threatening.  I recognize and adhere strongly to the rules about respecting others' in situ draws on routes, but, in this case, it seems irresponsible to leave these potential time bombs open to the public.  As far as I know, the draws are still there (as of 1/8/07).  I would vote to remove them as soon as the weather allows climbing in the canyon again.  If you did at any point leave draws on the route, go get them and throw them away (maybe not the biners).  If they're there later when it warms up, I might have to make an executive decision and get rid of them - they're more in the way and potentially dangerous than helpful.  Imagine climbing Vasodilator with a string of small cams and RPs instead of bolts and you get the idea.

    In regards to the webbing on the last bolt most people use it to pre-clip before doing the crux sequence and not as a point of aid.  Two years ago I asked Mark if he was willing to reposition the second to last bolt down and right which would have prevented either the presence of webbing or repositioning the last bolt, Mark's opinion is that the bolts are fine where they are.  I respect that, but also be aware that as long as people continue to work this route, the webbing will continue to be present, whether it gets repeatedly removed or not!    Instead of complaining about the unsightly view of a piece of webbing blowing in the wind, perhaps folks could be more constructive and rebuilt the approach gully, which is far more unsightly.  I have done some minor landscaping work in the past with boulders and wood present, but I believe that this effort could be better taken up by one of our organizations, as an Adopt-A-Crag event.

    Confession is good for the soul, right?  I was working on this route in the spring of 2000.  While working on the egg portion on lead, my partner and I took several very dangerous falls.  When we fell fairly high on the egg (which is easy to do), we'd swing down and sideways, with our legs clipping the rope below the bolt.  That caused us to windmill out of control and in one case I nearly whacked my head on the rock.  I thought it was very unsafe, so I stick clipped the bolt above the egg.  I then came back and placed the long sling to allow clipping from below and largely eliminate that problem.  I left it there after I finally sent the Violator (took a long time and a lot of belayers) because a friend wanted to work it.  I am not sure whether the sling up there is still the same one.  I would think it has gotten frayed from whipping around in the wind.  I did not think it was an eyesore since hardly anyone can see.  Anyhow, that's the story.  I think most people would be grateful for the long sling (or the addition of a bolt).  But, if someone wants to remove it, I certainly wouldn't fight about  it  -- just warn people.  Done.

    Adam, the difference between the tat and other garbage, is that the long sling serves a purpose, and has been placed intentionally.  On this route, in that location, it is extremely useful for those that don't flash 5.13.  The bolt is in a good location for the red point.  IMHO, moving the bolt would be a mistake.  Whipping off the crux is clean and fun, but most folks probably were gald to have the sling to yard on, so they could clip the bolt and work out the moves.  I think you should leave this one alone.  And,..if u take dat tat, is will be back.    Adam, why do you even bother to ask others for their opinion?  I offered my opinion after you requested feedback in this public forum.  Two of three people that responded said they did not have a problem with the sling, and then you post "so I'm going to take it down."  It sounds as is you feel strongly about this webbing, and are going to do what you want anyhow.  Go for it.  Next time just do it, without the disingenuous call for other's opinions and all the preaching. BTW, I didn't put the sling up, as you insinuated in your last post.

    While in no way dismissing Skip's ascent of Conan, rope solo technique using overhand knots is not entirely as cumbersome as it may sound.  By hanging loops of rope from a locking carabiner, it is possible to untie a section and quickly drop it when you reach the end of the active side of rope.  Drawbacks to this technique include the added weight of these loops, and the extra distance one would fall before the knot catches.    However, there are (and were "back in the day") several better methods for rope soloing, including: a moveable Munter-type knot system; the "Barnett system" using a prussik-type knot with limp yachting-type rope;  using inverted Gibbs ascenders; and an opposing Jumar system (which is still used by a well-known local climber to this day).    None of these out-dated systems compare in safety and ease of use to the Silent Partner, or for that matter the Soloist, Solo-Aid, or modified Gri-gri systems.      Still, no rope-solo device, system, or technique should ever be considered completely safe or fool-proof.  For this simple reason, rope-soloing at or near one's limit, particularly on remote, multi-pitch terrain, is best left for those with extensive rope-soloing experience, or better avoided altogether.    -SL

    The upper 1/2 of this route is so disjointed from the lower that it doesn't even feel like a route.  In fact, we climbed the upper part without even noticing the lower part since there is a huge belay ledge between.  It might be 10+ done that way.

    Furthermore, there is also a bomb-proof #1 Camalot placement (or I presume #2.5 Friend, but maybe a #2) in a small, horizontal "pocket" toward the top if you can find that exact spot. Since the climbing is slightly nebulous, you may or may not find this. I did, but my partner at first did not until taking a second lap on the climb.

    If you're top roping this line, an awesome start is to go directly up the white rock below the bolt. Awesome edges that make a very hard looking slab climb pretty moderately. Super fun, probably 10a!

    I agree with Tony that this route is adequately protected as the runout is protected by a super bomber piece. I also used the #1 Ballnut in the overlap to protect the crux off the ground the placement looks really good, and I think it would hold a fall. Really fun slab route.
    Jan 25, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If you start left of the tree, you can get a blue (smallest) Ballnut in the pin scar in the small overlap. This Ballnut looks good and survived a bounce test. Above this is very good gear, as Tony says. But, we led this by climbing a ways up the 5.6 variation a couple feet further left, placing gear, and then having a diagonal top rope for the crux moves. If you start from right of the tree, not only is there no gear, as stated by  Friso above, but it looks a lot harder, and it's a lot further to the bolt, since the ground slants down and right.
    Jan 24, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Pro is not non-existent.  You can place several locker small nuts that should hold a long sliding fall along the way.  The only really scary runout on the cliff is the one on the 5.10 to the right ("Crack Tack").  The rest have enough pro to keep them "s" instead of VS.  You'd get cheese-grated, but a fall from these should not be career-ending.

    Got on this thing yesterday thinking it was a 9. Then it started raining while I was pulling the crux. Felt like 11+ to me, but probably the combo of warm-up/rain/ and what the hell and I climbing factors. If it wasn't smarmy, I'd agree with calling it an 11. It's a slab though, so with good footwork and all it should be a bit easier than Jolt Cola and the like. I thought it was pretty fun for a slab. People should get on it! My 58/59m rope barely reached all the way back to the ground (past the anchors 20' up, which were kinda odd anyways unless this was put up on a 50m).

    No one seems to like this climb, but I love it.  I think that this climb is closer to 11b than 11d, even if you go straight up (which is the only way I've ever done it).  This climb is much easier than some of the 11c's and d's nearby: Orange Crush, Respite, Jolt Cola.  Either way, this climb is great.
    Nov 7, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Got on this again last weekend. Neither my brother Paul nor I could climb it straight up due in part to end of day fatigue and lack of motivation. Paul instead climbed it left of the bolt by walking his feet up the diagonal crack, barely in balance with small crimps, until he could high step with the right foot onto the hold on the lip a little down and left from the bolt. This is the same hold your left foot ends up on if you climb it direct. This left variation seems legitimate and is perhaps 2 letter grades easier and far less fingery and reachy than the direct.
    Nov 7, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    OK, well, I am not Ivan's height, I'm 5'10". I thought the climbing had a few 9+/10a spots, plus the crux, which I'd have guessed at 11c. The stemming was hard to get into and clipping the bolt just over the bulge was tough, then pulling over the bulge required some hard crimping and very wide stemming for me.  Maybe it would be easier in temps below 80 degrees F, as things would be less slick, but it's still a tough one relative to its 5.10 neighbors to the left.
    Sep 20, 2004

    For someone of my height (6'2" normal reach), I'd call this 11a/b by trad standards. If you can't reach the two long reaches to key edges, this could be a lot harder. Fun route, with consistent 9 and 10 climbing between the two bulges.

    I did this today and climbed most of Of Human Bondage (#59 in Bob's book) by mistake.  You have to keep looking left to stay on route, otherwise, IMHO, that is the most runout route here.  I got to the bolt, headed up toward the 2nd bolt (which is OHB), traversed left and up and mistakenly went right again to that 2nd bolt (another 1/4") got a bit above it; then down-climbed and went left again (got pro on the probable original line, and continued right to the anchors.

    Another in a series of "diagonal top ropes". You can climb up the right variation, place gear, down climb, and then climb the crux with a diagonal top rope. The way we did it we climbed up from the left side of the horizontal flake on good holds to end up about 6 feet left of the bolt, and then traversed right using good holds and a thin creaky flake to the bolt. The Rossiter guide sounds like the "real" route is a bit right of where we climbed (i.e., the real route is not the natural line). Above the bolt, the gear is good, and the climbing is much easier but interesting.
    Jan 24, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This was my first (or maybe 2nd) 5.9 lead. I remember placing a brass nut  in a small crack on the left side of a flake right at the top which, if it pulled, would have meant a ground fall. In fact, it did pull, but I did not hit the ground! As I moved left, the nut popped out, leaving me with essentially no pro. Fortunately the climbing must have been only 5.2 ish or so, but I still think it deserves the s rating. Not sure about vs - although it was vs the way I did it, I was also a very inexperienced leader at the time. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend it as a first 5.9 lead, but in retrospect it was kind of a cool experience anyway.
    May 24, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I think the VS rating is wrong as well.  I agree with the S, however.  If you are leading at your limit, you may find it frightening.  Another thing is that Rossiter's book shows it starting at two different points.      If started from the right as in the book, near the right-leaning features at the right-hand side of a well-vegetated block, and then up to a good flake, there is plenty of pro and the route is probably only 5.8+ or 5.9-.      If started at the seam to the left, from the left-most of the two blocks, you will have a short boulder problem to some gear and then a bolt.  This is S not VS, the fall would not be too bad, get a spotter and you won't break your skull or spine.

    No way is this an X route. There are actually quite a few natural placements after the bolt, and even one below the bolt as I recall. I even question a PG rating.

    The harder variation goes over a bulge to the left. I was able to get some ?able pro with tiny wired stoppers/RPs.

    Somebody who KNOWS where Gray Elk's Big Rack goes should post-up so we can see how much of it we climbed, but I think 80%.  We traversed over from DH1 to the top of GEBR belay and worked fairly straight up in 2 more pitches. We hit the OH with the 2 bolts, which seemed about 10 b/c, and wandered up to a 2 ring bolt anchor (100 ft?).  The last pitch went roughly straight up (seems definitely left of route 63 in Bob's book) but hit the crux flared crack below the tiny tree mentioned above) which may be the crux, but you can move 5 ft right and keep it in the 5.9 range, continuing a bit left then straight up to the anchors of TYATR, (130 ft?). The last bolt on TYATR was maybe only 13 feet left as I cruised to the anchors.  It seemed like a mt route, somewhat reminicent of the ADK's, adventurous, somewhat runout (bolts near each crux) and fun!  Our rack consisted of 5 QD, and 4 Camalots, 0.4-1 (never did place the 0.75). A few more pieces for those who don't want to be that runout might be helpful.  We then rap'd TYATR with one rope. Fun!!

    Ivan, ah...I see what Lenny is saying; however, the description and the photo didn't quite match what we climbed...even with that guidebook at the base of the climb.  Gray Elk's Big Rack (63) in D'Antonio's Boulder Canyon Rock Climbs doesn't describe the obvious traverse right at the start - which is obvious in our photo &amp; describes P2 having a "loose block" - which we didn't see, P3 as climbing "over a small roof to gain a crack" - rather, we found a crack over a bulge and the crack petered out, and P4 "short, steep face" and "11a" - we found no 11 climbing on our 4th pitch.  In addition, the photo for routes 62 (DH1) &amp; 63 have a significant gap at 62's p1 anchor and the strong leftward traverse depicted for 63's p4 didn't seem to match either.  Perhaps this requires another wander to clarify this.  Still, Lenny is probably right.

    Loose Rock Warning:  I took a short fall yesterday when I almost pulled off a 18" x 4" x 4" block on P2. I let go of the block (good instinct), fell, and grabbed the rope (bad instinct) and burned my hand a bit. The loose block is on P2 in the left-slanting, right-facing corner/ramp. This is just above the two close-together bolts above some easy trad climbing and just left of a 2-bolt anchor. I held onto the block, which seemed to be an integral part of the rock, as I pulled into the corner from the left, and then pulled straight out on the block as I started up the corner. At that point, the block lifted up several inches, and I took the plunge.

    Lenny Miller and I repeated this yesterday and did the route exactly as described by Leo. It's really hard to decide where to go--the route wanders and attempts to force you to climb hard bits here and there. Most cruxes can be easily avoided. My partner Lenny thinks the upper parts of this route are Black Elk, a route described in Bob d'Antonio's Boulder Canyon guide (which I don't have). For me, the move near the top through a short flare to a tiny tree was the crux. The lower crux through an overhang into a short corner and then right was treacherous due to being dirty. I Z-clipped here which led to some excitement. After the tiny tree, there are two more bolts up and right. I started to head that way but decided that was even more contrived than the climbing below and instead finished off left on Young and Rackless.

    Ron, you stopped too soon. It's not clear whether, after the first 3 bolts, you angled left to the anchor or angled right to a different anchor. If you go right, you can continue to the top past 2 or 3 more intermediate anchors with only slightly more protection bolts than anchor bolts--bring trad gear. This area of the cliff is confusing with anchors everywhere and long, easier trad sections between one or two bolt harder sections. This is how we climbed it:    After the first 3 bolts angle a bit right with occasional trad gear to an anchor. Clip a bolt just right of the anchor, step right, and up on moderate but sparsely protected rock to two bolts. Step right from the second bolt to a ledge and an anchor. Continue up moderate trad to another anchor. Step up then straight right at two closely spaced side by side bolts. Maybe 10a. Angle left a bit and up to a ledge. Make a hard move at another bolt, maybe 10b, then angle a bit right towards some dirty orange rock. Climb the final hard section just left of the orange rock at 2 more bolts and continue to the top and the final set of anchors. With two ropes, rap in one rappel slightly right and down Schizofrantic . With one rope, you can rap to the Schizofrantic anchors, and from there, carefully, to the ground with a 60m rope, or rap the route in 2 or more rappels.

    Fun route! The bottom crux is stiff right off the ground for shorter people but not bad for taller folks. There are at least 3 completely unnecessary bolts. I would recommend bringing a few DMM offset nuts yellow-blue, a medium-large nut or two, a hand-sized piece or two (#1, #2 C4), and a finger-sized piece or two (grey Alien or orange Metolius, red Alien or red Metolius). I skipped at least three unnecessary bolts where good gear was available. Three stars for good rock and fun (if a little awkward) movement. I might take away half a star for unnecessary bolts and bolts next to cracks. I think I ended up clipping about 6 bolts that felt necessary to protect the climbing.

    Did this again today. Great climb! But I did something pretty dumb. I left the remains of my trad rack hanging from the anchor bolts at the optional belay. About 15' higher I regretted that. Fortunately I was climbing on doubles and was able to stretch left and clip a bolt on the adjacent climb with one of my ropes.    I suspect I've done the top wrong twice now. Above the thin face upper crux I've moved left using a diagonal hand crack rather than continuing straight up to the next bolt along a thin crack. Moving left seemed logical and led to a welcome rest. Rolofson's topo shows the route jogging left and then back right in this vicinity, but maybe it moves left after climbing the thin crack?

    I'm not sure I would call this a "sport" climb.  The mantle out of the trad section is pretty heady.  Call it "mixed", and one of the best mixed climbs I've done in Boulder Canyon at that.  I didn't think it avoided any obvious trad ground at all.  The route does cross an established 5.8 trad line, but this is far from any of the bolted sections.      There's a little bit of everything on this pitch.  A boulder problem start, steep flake pulling, a trad corner with a spicey mantle, then thin face.  Each of these sections is separated by a no hands rest.  The gear listhere and in the Rolofson guide is a bit much.  I placed 3 or 4 medium stoppers and 2 cams.  A single set of cams from .75 to 2 inches should be fine.

    A few notes on the route:  There are Mussy hooks on the anchors at the top of this route.  This is one of the most sustained 12a routes I have climbed anywhere. Awesome!  A cool day would help with the sloper grease and slip factor.  The first crux is entirely non-trivial. This is where I blew my onsight.  The upper headwall after the crack is bolted a little too zealously. As soon as you clip the bolt after the crack, the falls are totally clean and safe. Clipping one of these bolts is pretty cruxy and perhaps unnecessary.   The route is continuously steep except for the ledge. Prepare to get pumped!  The rock is damn good. I will be back to redpoint.

    Much misinformation by Anonymous Cowards on this website.  Thanks Zach for setting the record straight.  Here's a bit of history on the route.  When the route was first established in 1987 by Dan Hare, Marc Hirt &amp; Tim Hudgel, the difficult 4 bolt start was avoided and a thin crack to the right was climbed to the ledge.  The upper face was climbed with 2-3 bolts.  When I first climbed the route in 1990, the direct start had been added by the first ascent party in 1989, but the crack above the ledge required placing gear.  In 1992, I returned to find 2 bolts added plus a bolt anchor (by Dan Hare).  There used to be a fixed hex in a crack above here to rappel from. Around 1996, I replaced the 3rd &amp; 4th bolts with new Rawl 5 piece bolts in the same holes.  These were loose wedge bolts that required little effort to pull out since only about an inch or less was still in the hole.  They were probably hand drilled which caused a flared hole allowing the bolts to move in different directions in the hole and eventually work their way loose.  Then around 1996,Dan Hare added another bolt for the upper crux,which is now the 9th bolt.  In 2009, the original bolts had bent SMC hangers that were spinners.  So I replaced all of them including the anchor. I also put 1 bolt on the ledge right of the old pin. As for the climbing, it's like doing two short 5.12a pitches in one 85 foot pitch, since there is a good rest ledge in the middle.

    Great route and as everyone said very continuous for the grade. More or less two sections of hard technical face climbing separated by a ledge that you can literally sit down and rest on.  The top can be tricky until you find out the sequences. A great climb on amazing rock. I am surprised that the beautiful cratered face out right is not bolted on the upper section. It actually looks more inspiring but a great deal harder. Do this route, you will like it!!!!

    "The Ticket" was bolted by the first ascent party (Dan Hare) in 1992. Rolofson replaced the bolts in 2009 and added a bolt off the ledge. He did call it "The New Ticket" in an earlier guide; however, it is named "The Ticket" in the most recent book.

    Amazing climb! Stiff for 12- by Bocan standards with lots of various techniques. A climb that would be easier in good sending temps to improve friction / reduce sweaty-little-sloper-pump! Oh, BTW there is a bomber bolt 2 feet right of the pin (which is on the easiest part of the climb) so don't let that deter you from getting on this outstanding and pumpy route!

    Definitely stiff compared to other 12as in Boulder Canyon- quite sequential, with a good mix of power and endurance- great route!!

    Awesome route, one of the best in BC.  Stiff.  This could be a candidate for a retrofit since there are a few questionable spinners.  If done, the two bolts that are close together at the upper crux should be combined into one (slightly higher than the first) to change the crux from clipping to climbing.

    This is also a great winter route-protected from the wind, and the sun stays on it until the very end of the day on the shortest days of the year.

    A nice static way to latch the "jug" at the top of the crack is to switch sides in the crack to a layback on the right. This lets you make a static reach to the jug and still keep your waist close to the clip. A slider or loweball will slot high in the crack and be bomb-proof.
    Oct 21, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Just a heads up to those folks (like me) that are pushing their limit at this grade.  I fell making the move to the sloper jug at the top of the crack (about 15 ft above the big ledge) and hit the big ledge just as the rope caught me.  And that was with my belayer watching me close.  A fall at this move with an inattentive belayer or an extra foot or two of slack will probably do some damage to your ankles.  That said, you could slot a nut in the crack a couple feet above the 6th (?) bolt to shorten the potential fall.  This move is probably mid-5.11.

    I had a chance to jump on this superb route near the end of May and will second the three star rating. I thought there were two fine cruxes, one between clips three and four and another entering the final head wall. Both seemed close to 5.12a with a good rest between. We stayed left of the crack above the ledge which reduced the actual crack climbing to a bare minimum, and while this seemed a sacrilage, the crack did not seem very friendly when taken straight on. Excellent stone, good continuity, lots of open hand forearm pump all serve to rachet up the stars. If only all of the granite in the front range were as nice that on Blob Rock...

    Great climb, for sure sequences of 5.10 (a-b) in pitch 2 and 3; however, the rest of the route is fairly cruiser. Best rappel would be using a 70m and rapping to rappeler's right from pitch 4 anchor. You will come onto a diagonal ledge that runs down to the right where the second sets of rings are, about 80 feet. The 2nd rap gets you to the ground comfortably.

    I agree with J. Albers's comment that the bolting on this route reflects the ledgy nature of the rock. Both the P2 and the P3 cruxes are right above a ledge. So if you blow the move, you're very likely to hit the ledge. So I think the route is bolted well (not overly bolted), especially for people leading at the grade.

    All of the pitches were pretty fun and overly protected. The first three of which had some short sequences that push the grade to 5.9 where the majority of the pitches could probably be climbed hands free if you felt so inclined.    To Second Travis Provin, rapping from the top w/ 60m ropes is comfortable. Just keep right, and look for an anchor on a bomber ledge. Both ends of the rope will be about 15ft past the anchors. The second rap is super fun and the rope will just be touching the ground.    If you end up finding the other 70m rappel because you didn't go far enough right, just swing to the left on your second rappel and there is another anchor that you can tie in to finish the rap in 3.

    My second time up this fun route today. Combined the first two pitches then did the 3rd and 4th as described. (Might be a good idea not to combine the last two pitches if you think your follower might have troubles on the cruxes of P3--nice to have a visual and be able to communicate.) This time, on P3, we took the right variation (crack). It looked like bomber hands from the belay below, but it was anything but in the short crux section...flared and fingery. I thought it was harder than the left variation--especially so if you are not a crack climber. This time, we rapped down rather than doing the walk/scramble. No sweat in two rappels with our 70m rope. From bolts at the top of the 4th pitch, we rapped down and slightly to climber's right and found the next bolt station high on the wall behind the big ledge. Second rap to the ground was overhanging for the last bit. It dropped us off maybe 50m above our packs. Oh, a note on that weird move into the dihedral just above the two 3rd pitch variations: the first time up this it took me a good 10-15 minutes to figure it out. This time, I got it almost immediately. I think it is near 5.9+ to 5.10 the first time you try it, then 5.7 once you unlock the really cool sequence.

    Awesome multi-pitch! Just a note for all who are planning on climbing this in the near future -- I just climbed this route last week, and the left anchor bolt at the belay for the 4th pitch (top of the 3rd pitch) was very loose. The nut holding the bolt into the wall was loose and unscrewing itself, and I actually tightened it with my fingers! So if anyone has a wrench to carry up with them (not sure the size), it could use tightening.

    Awesome route! Very fun and secure climbing. P3 is the crux, not difficult just thought provoking.    You can easily rap from the top with a 60m in two raps. Angle right and you'll end up at an anchor. It's one more rap (with a fun hanging rappel) to the ground. Knot your ropes regardless.

    Want a free headlamp and/or need karma points!?    Climbed TYATR November 12 (first of all, can we talk about that for a second? 70 and sunny on Nov. 12!). Was fiddling with the headlamp girthed to my harness on the descent and dropped it. Orange and gray Petzl Tikka2. It was dark, and we were kind of screwing up the descent, I accidentally undid the hitch down from the Blob Slab a little ways toward the road. It was trail, but not the one we came up on past the main face, or maybe it was just a water runoff and I'm dumb. Go get her and give her back to me, 'cuz you're great!    As for the climb itself? Sorry to be a hater, but I thought it was a little overrated. Kind of like 3 pitches of one move wonders stacked on top of each other. The last pitch is beautiful in its way, but the line isn't super proud, exposed, or consistent. However, much like burrito chains, I'm glad that it exists.

    Climbed this wonderful route today in raging winds (probably gusts to 40+mph). Due to the winds, rather than rappel, we chose to walk off the back and down the gully to our packs at the base of the climb (still in our trad shoes as well). This probably took less time than doing the two rappels into the gully. Something to consider even when it isn't so windy. Or...maybe I'm just an old guy who likes to avoid rappelling at every opportunity.

    I agree with Merlin's assessment, though I found some of the moves towards the end of Pitch 3 to be quite weird, though I might have missed something. Pulling over the weird bulge thing at the end of Pitch 3 was the headiest move on the whole climb. Not super difficult (I think the 9+ rating is pretty apt) but definitely headier than the rest of the climb.    To rappel, I had a single 70 meter, and went straight down from the last anchor. If you angle slightly right as you rap, you'll end up at a two bolt anchor with rap rings. I had about 15~20 feet of rope left at that anchor.  From there, it's a free hanging rap to the ground. I had about 30 feet of rope on the ground.

    As per the USFS press release, this route and the whole Blob Rock/East Blob Rock/Bitty Buttress and Security Risk areas are open to climbing as of 3/13/2015. Read on to learn more about where the eagles nest in Boulder Canyon, how the annual eagle closures work, and why they are needed.    The pair of golden eagles in this territory have alternate nest sites on Blob Rock, East Blob Rock, Bitty Buttress, and Eagle Rock. The reason for the early season closures of these cliffs is to allow the eagles to select a nest site, rebuild the nest, and lay and incubate their eggs without human interference, and it is of particular importance on this popular route, when closures are in effect, because one of the alternative eagle nests is on pitch 4 of Young and Rackless.     As part of a small team of volunteer climber-biologists, we install trail cameras on the cliffs before the nesting season and make observations to determine when and where the eagles choose to nest. Once nesting is confirmed by observations of incubation behavior and/or an egg, the USFS opens the other areas. Ongoing observations are used to keep track of the number of eagles fledged and sources of mortality. Once fledging is confirmed, the nest cliff is opened again to climbing. This is a collaborative effort built on trust and shared interest between the climbing community, biologists, and USFS, so please get the word out. (Knuckleheads who violate the closures to climb anyway, selfishly violate that trust, put the eagles at risk of nest failure, and face a hefty fine.)    Climbers played essential roles in the research and recovery of peregrine falcons and Sierra bighorn sheep, and brought the California condor back from the brink of extinction. It is our time to do our part again, and respect the closures when they are in effect, as golden eagles face an uncertain future because of threats from wind turbines, lead contamination, electrocutions, and habitat loss.     Rob Roy Ramey II, Ph.D.  climber-biologist                           A golden eagle lands at the nest on the 4th pitch of Young and Rackless while investigating this and other potential nest sites prior to egg laying (see comment below).

    I think it's worth bringing a 70m for this route because it makes the rappels smooth and easy. Notes on the rappels:     Option 1: this is the best option and is 2 rappels with a single 70m rope.    From the top of the route (P4), rappel straight down. You will not be able to see the next set of anchors as you begin the rappel. Rap down eventually going over a bulge where you'll see a few bolts then another set of rap anchors (Fixe rings). Consider putting knots in the ends of your rope even if you're not normally in the habit of doing so, because by the time you're standing on the small ledge to clip the anchor, you will only have a few feet of rope left (again, this is with a single 70m rope - a single 60m will not make it).     For the next rappel, you will make it to the ground with room to spare.    Option 2: alternative option that may work with a single 60m rope (I've only done it with a 70m rope but had rope to spare):    From the top of the route (P4), rappel down and trend slightly right. You will see a set of anchors on a sloping ledge. Head to them.    From the sloping ledge, rap down trending slightly right. You will see another chain/pin/bolt anchor (which you don't use) on your way down before dropping over the leaning dihedrals/overhangs.     Note that neither of these options involve using any of the anchors on the route itself. Rapping the route is impractical given the traversing nature of the route and the simplicity of the above options and may be inconsiderate given the popularity of this route.

    What is the bolted line above the second pitch on The Young and the Rackless? It is a long pitch, 12+ bolts, that goes left from just above the 2nd anchors. Starts about 40 feet left, not really walkable from the 2nd anchors, have to rap in from the 3rd anchors. Heads up some bulges then straight up the steep headwall that is perfectly flat about 20 yards west (uphill) of TYATR. Seemed like 12+ to me, couldn't find it on MP at all. Didn't get to the top, two bolts short but seemed like the nothing was above it, definitely nothing was bolted below it; we had to rap to a ledge and walk climber's left to the first anchors of TYATR. Anyone know?

    Crux on pitch 2 did feel more like a 10a than a 9. I did it laying back to the left, which risks a bit of a swing if you fall on lead.     Overall a great climb.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I felt the right variation on the third pitch was significantly harder than the left variation which felt much more like the 5.9/10a climbing of this route.     Also, the walkoff isn't as intuitive as you might think. We went straight back from the belay and then scrambled up to the top of the face. You then are able to see the burned out path through the field and then into the gully.     Bring approach shoes if you want to walk off. We lapped it twice and found it significantly easier to just rap the pitches.     Peter

    I've done this twice now, going up is nothing but fun.  The P3 crack option to the right is great (harder of course)!    The rap though has been the crux both times though.

    Climbed this in a party of three and had a blast. Well bolted and fun all the way up. Crux is near the top of P3, in my opinion. Was able to make it to the ground in only one rap thanks to the two 60m's we brought up with us.
    Aug 9, 2012

    I thought this one was super fun. Crux pitch for me was definitely the awkward slot move at the top of P3. We did the two rappels to the climber's right. Definitely a good move as there were 2 parties behind us. If I were to do it again, I would combine pitches 1 and 2.

    Wow! First multi-pitch was a blast. Nothing to complain about on this route. It was overly safe with bolts and great rock. The route is straightforward and a great climb.

Rappel from 3rd pitch straight down to two chain anchors (not used during route). Rappel to ground.    Be careful, we had a 60m rope and made the second rappel (from 3rd pitch to anchor's directly below) with no more than 2m's of rope to spare.

    Quite a fun route that would make a great intro to multi-pitch climbing for those looking to get into it. I thought the climbing was probably no harder than 5.8 and not very sustained at that. Fun for what it is...a relaxing, moderate, sport outing.    Also, a note about the bolts. It is my opinion that many of the closely spaced bolts reflect the ledgy nature of this route. My guess is that the route developers spaced some of the bolts closely to prevent busted ankles in the event of a fall. I know that I appreciate route equippers who do this on 5.12, so I don't see why 5.9 should be any different. Furthermore, I find it a little funny that folks would harp on the bolting job of Mr. Kodas. I actually think it reflects highly on him for his ability to put up routes of widely varying styles (bold versus well bolted). Both types of routes are equally valid IMHO. For those of you who are upset about over bolting, I would be happy to point you in the direction of any number of Mr. Kodas' routes in the Southern Sierra that will surely require a change of pants afterwards.

    Just climbed today. I'd agree with many others in that pitches 1-3 involve pretty simple climbing with a hard move thrown in every once in a while. The crux on pitch 2 was a bit difficult and out of reach for me, and there is a real fun heel hook move on pitch 3. Slab climb on pitch 4 is fun. Overall, I'd say it is fun, gets you up there, yet it doesn't feel too exposed. The approach is a pain in the a**.

    Funny how climbing a route more than once changes your perspective. I climbed this route 3 times in a 2 week period to introduce a few new climbers to a multi-pitch outing.   The first time I thought it was maybe a 5.9 for most of the route, but the crux on the third pitch felt to me around 5.10+.   I was GRIPPED when pulling up to the top of the 3rd pitch belay ledge on lead.   Climbed it again a few days later and was digging the MP.com rating over the sport and adventure climbing guidebook, because a 5.10b it is not.   Third time I went back I was so comfortable with it that I soloed it, because I know for a fact I wont ever be able to mark a climb rated 5.10b in a guidebook as a free solo ever again.     Super fun route, absolutely perfect bolt spacing when you want it, you get to do all the hard moves practically on top rope(some would call it overbolted, I just call it safely bolted, but we won't get into that here. So, to each their own).   A great intro to multi pitch climbing, would do it again any day.

    Fun outing for a multi pitch sport climb.  I'm a tad over 5'6" an felt the reach on pitch two warranted a 9+.  I'd rate climb as 5.8 for pitch 1, 9+ pitch 2, 5.9 for pitch 3 ( I thought the right hand crack variation was much better then the left variation) and 5.7 for pitch 4.  Easy to run pitch 1 &amp; 2 together.

    A fun cruiser route, worth doing at least once...  I especially enjoyed the bolted crack on the variation to P3.  There is no need to bring any gear, since there are bolts right next to the crack.  Maybe that variation should be called "The Old and the Rackless" or "Clip'em or Skip'em".
    Jan 28, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree that this is not a very sustained climb.  P1 (I lead) seemed to start with a 5.9ish face climb which quickly relented to 5.7 then almost 5.2-5.4.    P2 (friend lead) started around 5.7 then went quickly to 5.10a/b for all of 10 feet.  I watched my 6'1" friend pull right up the hard part and head up to the anchors.  Being relatively short, this move was not easy and definitely harder than 5.9.  If you can reach the jug on the right, it might be 5.8/5.9.  After passing it, the climbing eased up again.    p3 (I lead) I went left and found the climbing to be 5.7-5.8 then dropping to 5.0 and a ledge walk.  From here, there was an odd move into a slot which felt 5.9 then quickly relented to 5.7.    p4 (friend lead) was the best of the 4 pitches in my opinion.  It was the most sustained at about 5.8 and required a bit of delicacy.    All in all, I think this route would be pretty easy for a beginning 5.9 sport leader, assuming you can reach the move on the 2nd pitch.  I couldn't so it would sketch me, but if I was 5'10" or above, I think this climb is not to sustained and felt more like a scramble with bouldering moves.    All in all, though it was quite fun and had great views.  It provided enough thrills without being too sustained.
    Aug 24, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    VERY friendly beginner climb... probably a bit too friendly.  I think this route is 5.8... 98% of the climb is mellow, enjoyable (massively overbolted) climbing, with 2.5 moves of 5.8, maybe 5.8+ on it. I just hope this doesn't become the new standard of bolting - when a long draw can be clipped between two bolts you know something is off a little...     Great eye spying that line, though.    My rating comes about by comparing this line with   Mosquito Burrito  - 5.8   Topless Etiquette - 5.8  Bastille Crack    - 5.7    All these climbs seem harder to me than TYATR.

    We did this today and easily got off with two rappels with a 60m rope. (See Ron's comment above). Simply rap a bit to your right to a spacious ledge with two bolts, then rap to the ground. The last 40 ft or so is an free rappel which makes for kind of an adventursome feel to the end of the climb. A knot in the end of the rope might be a good idea because I had maybe 4 ft of rope left when I touched the base. In the latest guide book this is still rated 5.10b for what it is worth. I personally think a newer 5.9 lead climber would find this to be pretty challenging outing.

    Did this route yesterday and really enjoyed it.  It was nice getting that high above the canyon.  I'm curious what the route is (higher up) that is visible from the top of the last pitch.  There is a crack up there with lots of chalk, no bolts that I could see.  Can you link this with the last pitch and rap from the top?  The crux on P3 stumped me for a second but once I figured out the sequence, it was solid.  We had a 70 m rope and rapped from the top of p4 to the bottom in 2 raps.  In doing this, we were not rappelling directly down onto the Young and the Rackless, which is good since 2 parties were on their way up and the other climbs were vacant.
    Aug 29, 2005

    We linked Pitches 1 and 2 together and Pitches 3 and 4 together with a 60 meter rope. Rope drag wasn't bad, though we selectively skipped bolts. Pitches 1 and 2 seemed much easier, we only used six clips total for both pitches. Pitches 3 and 4 seemed to have a few more difficult moves, so we only skipped a couple of bolts yet still had minimal rope drag. We did three raps down the route, the last leaving us with about ten feet of downclimbing... if you descend this way, DO NOT RAP OFF THE END OF YOUR ROPE.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    We were fortunate to see a huge golden eagle soaring above the cliff shortly after we topped out.    The best descent from the top is two rappels straight down the rock with a 60m rope.  The first rappel  is 80'; angle to the rappeller's right to get to the next bolted rap station.  The second rappel is 95'.  This leaves you about 100' uphill from the start of the route.  Be careful how you pull the rope on the second rappel to avoid flakes and cracks that could snag the rope.    Above the intermediate rap station is a steep headwall with two bolts.  Thirty feet higher is a third bolt.  This appears to be a mixed pitch requiring trad gear to supplement the bolts.  Does anyone know the name of this route or how hard it is?  I didn't see any bolts leading up to the intermediate rap station.
    Oct 4, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A route with a lot of easy territory (5.4) some moderate territory (5.7) and maybe three 5.9 moves. Best done as a single ~75 meter pitch and ~20 slings, or by linking the first 3 pitches (~ 60M) and then doing the last pitch later. We had a 70M rope and simuled only a short amount to go all at once. You skip a lot of clips (we made 19 in all) to keep the line straight and avoid drag, we had almost none but the weight of the rope.    It's hard not to give a 250' single pitch of solid rock at least 2 *'s.  If it had been more sustained at any given grade (5.6 or 5.10, whatever) or more consistent in character, it would be a 3-star route, but it is more mileage than it is interesting.

    I forgot to add a correction to the post. The tree at the base is dead, but it has branches. The branchless one is 200 feet farthur uphill, and would give you 50 feet of climbing.

    Fun route. This can be done quickly by linking the pitches. 2 awkward moves of 9. We rapped straight down with a 60m and got off in two raps by using other anchors.

    Fun.  Probably most efficient to link P1/2 including 12-13 clips &amp; P3/4 including 17 clips.  Believe P4 has about 7 bolts &amp; 2 pins.  These old pins suggests it may not be a 2003 FA and someone, like Layton?, may have been here....  If you rap with 2 ropes, you can get to another modern 2 bolt rap station about 140 ft below the top anchor.  5.9 for the reach move on P2.  P3's move is weird but felt easier.

    For a boulder canyon bolted moderate, this one is good.  There are many, many bolts.  I even skipped a couple to link pitches, and didnt get scared.  At every hard move, you have a bolt (or two) within reach.  Much of the route could be climbed without bolts, if you brought gear, thus the morality of the route will create mixed feelings for traditional climbers.    Considering the 5.9 rating, If 'Mission to Mars' (solaris) and the bihedral arete (bihedral have been downrated from 5.10 to 5.9 standings, then I would think this route should be called a 5.8+ since it is a grade easier (in my opinion) than either of those routes.  There are always bomber holds, and I found the trickiest part to be entering the corner on p3, even though the other cruxes were wet.  Perhaps its best to simply call the route 5.fun, since thats what it is.      An excellent climber for moderate leaders.

    BTW we carried a second 60m rope with us up this climb and were able to rap all the way down in one rap.  This only works if you throw the rope down to the left of the route while at the top and looking down.     Have fun! It's a great fun route!    Steve

    I really liked that crux move at the end of pitch 3. At first it seemed like you had to do something hard.  But in the end, it actually goes without too much trouble. The trick was to push instead of pull.

    Saturday July 3rd, we arrive at the base of this route at 7:30 AM to find a party ahead of us!  Damn, this route isn't even in a guidebook and already it is mobbed!  It must have been Jake and Annette, who were nearly up pitch 2 and moving quickly.  Despite the early morning traffic, we didn't see anyone on this route the rest of the day ...    This route is fun and very well bolted.  It is hard to rate because the cruxes are short bulges that go quickly once you figure them out.  But I could see reach being an issue.  The move that took me the longest to figure out was the bulge after the two variations join on pitch 3.  This route felt significantly easier than the similar vintage Bihedral Arete.

    Did the climb again today.  The right-hand variation on the third pitch felt about 5.9 on dry rock.  The flared hand jams at the top of the initial corner were pretty solid for me, but can be quite difficult for people with small hands.    The left-hand variation on the third pitch also felt about 5.9 on dry rock.  Solid hands and one high-step layback move, and it's over.  The moves into the corner near the end of the third pitch are tricky to figure out, but a hoot once you unlock the secret.    This is a great climb for the budding 5.9 leader: four pitches that come in at 5.9, 5.9, 5.9, and 5.8 with plenty of bolts.  Do both variatons on the third pitch and you have five good pitches of climbing.    This will become the classic moderate multi-pitch sport route in Boulder Canyon.

    The third pitch (left variation) felt harder than the second pitch.

    A fun multi-pitch well-bolted sport route.  The first pitch starts with several 5.9 moves up a steep headwall then eases up to the belay.  Be sure to head up left to the belay; there are other anchors up to the right, but they are on another route.    The second pitch headwall felt like 5.9 to me and my partner; the good holds weren't hard to reach.  We did the left variation on the third pitch.  The crux bulge felt harder than 5.9.  My partner did it with a heel hook, and I did it as a layback from the left; both moves felt like 10a, but the handholds were wet and maybe it would be easier if the rock were dry.  The move entering the slanting corner up higher was pure fun!    The fourth pitch is a nice 5.8 slab with 8 bolts.  We rapped down and I tried the right variation on the third pitch, but was turned back by wet rock at the flared hand jams.  This seemed like it would go at 5.9+ to 10a if the rock were dry.    This is a fine route that will become very popular.

    I was just on this route today. I hadn't climbed it since 2009. I've climbed it several times since 2000. I didn't see any new bolts. The hole left of 5th bolt was there before Tod bolted this climb. It's the reason he named it Lost &amp; Found.  Dan Hare had drilled some holes, years before but never returned to bolt the route. This was something Dan did often. There are empty holes on Vasodilator past the 7th bolt. He drilled them 2 years before I established that route. He didn't place one bolt, not even the anchor.  This is a fun route with a burly crux. There is a sidepull pinch at the base of the corner for the right hand that allows you to reach the flat edge on the arete with the left hand. The crux is definitely the 6th bolt getting into a lieback in the corner.  I was quite baffled by Jason's  &amp; J. Albers comments. The rope runs fine if you climb the intended line which moves into the corner right of the arete. I understand that you climbed the crux on the face left of the arête. This must be a bit harder &amp; not bolted to climb this way. I did see the holds out left. Try the intended try.
    Dec 19, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    J. Albers that's really interesting as it seems you and your partner and me and my partner had opposite interpretations/experiences with it. I'm curious - how do you clip that bolt? For me, I reach up to that flat jug on the arete with my right. I have to then switch hands to clip the bolt but then switch hands back again so that I can grab the small edge with my left and then up again with the right to pinch the arete. It felt like a lot of unnecessary movements compared to how it was originally bolted and also forces the rope into the crack above (which is why we thought the bolt was placed around to the left originally). Do you just do a left hand on the flat jug and then go right hand all the way up to pinch the arete without the lefthand edge? I could see if your feet are further right, as in around the arete, the rope wouldn't really bother you at all. For me, I'm much more left with my legs and body position overall, as I'm kind of tall and the way facing right felt like it was going to be too scrunchy for me (I didn't touch anything right of the arete). Because of that, when I highstepped up onto the flat jug, I had to keep trying to kick the rope out of the way so I didn't step on it.    On the unrelated statement of quality - I agree it's a good route and climbs much better than it looks from the ground.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    ^^^  Funny you should comment on this, Jason, because I climbed this a few days ago and was going to comment on how my partner and I appreciated the location of the new bolts. To be clear, I never climbed the route pre-update, but from the looks of the old bolt hole location under the roof, my partner and I both concluded that this bolt was probably moved to the right because the location of the old bolt caused the rope to run over the sharp arete edge. In contrast, the new placements leave the rope running in a smooth line that leaves the rope running out to the right away from the arete edge when the rope comes taut.     Don't get me wrong, Jason, I hear what you are saying about the rope running over the hold on the arete because of the bolt that is located on the right-facing corner, but compared with the previous situation where the rope was running across the very sharp arete, this seems like a pretty minor concern. Moreover I found it pretty very easy to scoop my hand underneath the rope to grab the pinch, no big deal. Moreover I think that clipping both of the crux bolts is pretty easy as it is currently step up for a reasonable range of climbers (my partner and I range from 5'8" to 5'11").    As far as the route goes, I was really pleasantly surprised at its quality. It packs some pretty fun climbing into a relatively short section of stone. Good stuff.

    Thank you to whomever updated the crux sixth bolt. I truly mean that. Bolts need updating, so thank you for taking time away from your own personal climbing to do a community service that benefits everyone. However, if you are not going to reuse the same hole, please climb the route and notice where the newly intended bolt will be and how that effects the rope. The "new" clip is now a lot more awkward, and the subsequent sequence is annoying with the rope running over the holds you want to use. Where the bolt was located before avoided these problems - it was set up for better clipping, and the rope didn't interfere with the climbing. You also didn't patch the hole. I guess the silver lining/benefit to that is that we can still reuse the old hole and pull/patch your new replacement eventually, thus eventually fixing this situation altogether. While in general moving a bolt slightly is not a big deal (and sometimes the best thing to do), I think this time it was a big detractor for the above reasons (especially when you take it around the other side of an arete like that).

    This is a fun route with good gear through the crux.

With more traffic, it would clean up nicely. I'm sure it's related to skill (or lack thereof), but I thought it was reachy through the crux.

    I would have to disagree with Tony about climbing this without the first bolt clipped, especially if you are short. If you blow that section -- which is one of the cruxes of the route -- your ankles would eat a pretty big sh*t sandwich. Moreover, I agree with the Mr. Huggins that the bolt placement is probably in the ideal spot as a bolt any lower would be pretty pointless given the climbing in that section. Just preclip it and forget about it.    I guess the climbing on this has a couple nice moves, but the bottom is sharp and painful and the top the upper crux has some awfully janky rock.
    Apr 29, 2015

    With a spot, the first clip is not a big issue.  It's reasonable. This is a pretty good route for as short as it is and would be a good short project, because the moves are not obvious but not that hard in reality. 4-star moves on a 1-star length climb.
    May 26, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I [definitely] agree, the bolts are a wee bit close together higher up on the climb. Seems unlikely a 5.12 climber would be scared at that point. When I clipped the bolt at the beginning of the upper crux, the one below was above my waist. (!)    As to the first bolt: certainly reasonable enough, Joe, and it doesn't take a very long stick to clip it. I do think the first bolt even a couple/few feet lower would be clippable sans stick from the ground and still provide the necessary pro to do the first crux sequence. But, it makes little difference in the end. Its a sport route...    I tried to psych myself up to do the opening without gear, to just climb up and clip the bolt, and after a few false starts decided against it. I'm glad I did...the moves are very tenuous.
    Jan 24, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Fred seems surprised at the need to stickclip the first bolt. We decided that this was the way to do it, as the crux is right off the ground; a lower bolt didn't make sense to us. Also, I was told by Mark Rolofson that he had added a bolt between our second and third bolts because some "5.12 climbers had gotten really scared". Imagine that, scary climbing!So I went up to check out his bolt; it seems to me that he placed it in the middle of a move(which isn't particularly hard). I didn't chop the bolt, despite some advice to the contrary, as I don't want to be accused of scaring helpless 5.12 climbers.

    A black Alien and #5 HB offset at your feet protect the crux section pretty well, above that a nut can be slotted in a groove above you that would probably hold a top rope fall.

    Fun route, and it makes the short hike up a little more worth it when climbed with Edges and Ledges. As mentioned before, there are a few loose rocks on this one, the loose rock near the last bolt appears to still be there and is currently marked. There are some loose rocks to the right as you move up towards the anchors as well, but they are pretty easy to avoid.     I did have a hold blow on me though right at the first bolt. It wasn't really on route per se, but I imagine I'm not the only person that has done this. When I was directly below the first bolt, and before stepping up onto the actual wall, I had my hand under the ledge down/right (should have known better, it felt a little questionable). When I leaned back a bit to re-position myself, the hold blew completely and VERY nearly sent me tumbling back down to the belay, which is at least 20 feet. Just be aware, and don't do what I did. The distance from there to the ground is enough to wreck your day.

You can get 1/2-3/4" pro above it to avoid a cut rope in a fall, so that might be worth doing.

    This is a fun route.  We did not use a #3 Camalot in the spot in Leo Paik's picture.  We used smaller cams just above and a #3 as the last piece, much higher.  The crux is certainly at the spot listed in the picture.  This route shares an anchor with Family Guy and Same as it Ever Was and does not have its own anchor as shown in the D'Antonio guide.

    We thought about calling this area the Senior Wall or more aptly the Heat Stroke Wall. It can really get hot here, so plan wisely. The climb was named to reflect my entry in the Colorado Senior Open (golf) at the end of this month. In a few years, I will be able to play in the "super senior" division (60+).

    Most of the loose boulders earlier commenters mention appear to be gone. The approach gully definitely has a couple of blocks that I'd rather not trust, but you don't have to go anywhere near them, and if you do touch them, they're not precariously balanced.    The climb itself is pretty clean and definitely a good intro for a new 5.8 leader.

    This is a fun climb and one of the best 5.8 climbs I have come across in BC.  I was just there yesterday, and the poison ivy is just starting to leaf out. So it would probably be safe for a bit longer, but you could see that once its in full bloom it would be EVERYWHERE in the immediate area. In reference to the comment above, I'm not sure why you would belay from the first bolt, that seems needless since there is an obvious belay spot at the bottom of the route. This can safely be done with a 60m rope as well.
    Apr 22, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Not bad, not great.  Very convenient to climb and go, look out for the poison ivy warnings - the little plants with berries are growing up (April 2012).  :)  The gully is pretty clear of rolling rocks, it's mainly the approach that will send the rocks downwards.    The obvious belay position below the first bolt has minimal places to stand and you'd have to attach yourself to the bolt to ensure that you won't go for a tumble.  You could belay from the bottom of the gully way far from the face I guess - we were able to rap down from the anchor to the bottom of the gully on a single 60m rope.

    This is a great fun route!  Positive holds and nice bolt placements make for a nice lead.  Some of the really loose rock in the gully to the left came down on us today, although not quite down to the road and it cleared out the gully a bit, but it's still pretty bad, so a great idea to avoid it, as previously mentioned.  Since the area is still relatively new, there was some loose rock falling as we were climbing - just be aware.

    When you're climbing or descending from this route, stay out of the loose gully on the left, and stay on the slab to the right. There are a number of loose rocks in and left of the gully that are too big to trundle, since they might go all the way to the road. Please do your best to avoid them.

    A Metolius No. 7 (BD No. 2 Camalot) was nice for the upper crack. I climbed level with the anchors to a no-hands at the top of the wall, downclimbed back to the cam, pulled it, and lowered off a biner that's been left on bolt 5. This saves your rope over the lip and the headache of getting out right to the anchor.    Cool climb! Painful while working the beta (maybe tape your pinkies) but then not so painful when you figure out the sequences. Airy but safe. Enjoy!

There is a big flake near the top of the route that vibrates when you tap on it, but it appears to be firmly anchored in the surrounding rock. You can get a good #1 Camalot in an overlap to the right, and avoid using the top of the flake as a handhold, without increasing the difficulty of the climb.

    I really enjoyed the jamming on this climb but felt very uncomfortable pulling on the block just below the chains. It sounds like there was an even looser one here. Anyway, if you use less optimum holds/jams around it you can minimize the pull force on the block.

    P.S. Boulder Slips is NOT dangerous if you take extra yellow Aliens and 1.5-2" (or green Camalot) cams  It's absuurd to say it, and maybe it is 'independent' of the original line of Boulder Slips and Jim did that, however....    Given that Boulder Slips can climb the left or right options up top via cracks on lead from the ground (and having done both), it is crystal clear that this route indeed added bolts to the reach-zone of Boulder Slips, and so they are retro-bolts, insofar as I am concerned.

    I climbed My Way this afternoon with Adam Massey.    We both enjoyed this fine addition.  I have climbed Boulder Slips, which is dangerous, and this is clearly an independent line.  I have not done Threshold, but that one also appears to me to take its own line left of My Way.    While Crusher and Andy have a practiced eye for this type of impact, in my view My Way is a well-protected mixed route and should remain as a popular choice for those of us too scared to send Boulder Slips or too weak to lead Threshold.
    Sep 17, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Andy,    The lead bolts on My Way do not impact the Boulder Slips route.  The climbing line on Boulder Slips is well to the right of the bolts on My Way.    People climbing Boulder Slips have the option of angling left to the anchor on My Way; that is the only impact.
    Jul 13, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I did Threshold with Crusher a couple of nights ago and ended up following the bolts. Looked at the guidebook later and it seems from Boulder Climbs North (Rossiter) that Threshold finishes left of the upper prow and Boulder Slips (FA solo by Erikson) takes the cracks on the right. In this case My Way is independent BUT having the bolts there still changes the character of both of the previous routes by affecting the runouts required on each. In my opinion having a mental challenge on a route is a good thing, so adding bolts detracts from the older routes, infact it's just plain naughty.
    Jul 13, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Hi Ron, thanks for your thoughtful response.    Well, from my perspective I'd say yeah, pull the bolts. And if you did I'd add a very big thank you for having the flexibility to be willing to remove your bolts. I would suggest leaving the anchor at the top, as a tree-saving measure (or maybe just laziness...) but that would be your call.    But from a climber-community perspective, perhaps we should try to solicit some opinion from any other folks who have done the routes in this area. Anyone else?    I think I need to go back and do one or two of the other routes nearby to get a better feel for exactly what goes where.
    Jul 13, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Crusher,    it sounds as if the Ament and Rossiter descriptions of The Threshold are different in some critical respects.  We based our choice of line on My Way using Rossiter's guidebook.  We wanted to find an independent line between The Threshold and Boulder Slips, and thought we had found one.  But your climb, and Ament's description, make it sound as if The Threshold can take a line similar to My Way in the upper part.    However, there is a climbable line left of My Way and right of The Throttle that matches Rossiter's description of The Threshold, staying left of the prow. That is what I climbed when I did Threshold Variation.    I think the problem is that it is possible to climb several lines from the stance at the base of the prow, and later move from one line to another without difficulty. It's even possible to get over to Boulder Slips and climb the upper part of that line from the start of the prow.    It was not our intention to impact The Threshold when we installed the bolts on My Way.  But certainly, the way you climbed The Threshold merged with My Way in the upper section.    I can remove the bolts and anchor we installed for My Way, and erase the route.  However, I think that will doom The Threshold and Boulder Slips to the obscurity they have enjoyed for many years, with a tedious walkoff (or double-rope rappel from trees) instead of the easy descent from the bolt anchor.  Let me know what you think I should do.
    Jul 13, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Ron, I don't recall much from when I first did Threshold 20 years ago, but I'm sure I would have headed pretty much straight up after the crux. Did Threshold yesterday. Anything else but straight up would be pretty contrived. I added Threshold to the database. Perhaps others could add some opinions. The route has never been popular, but that's a shame, as it is a great pitch. The new rap anchor on top might help its popularity.      There is a tad more detail about Threshold in Ament's High Over Boulder:    "After the hand crack, work up the prow and finish up and left with a thin crack."    Ament also specifically states that it is only the hand crack that is left of the prow itself, and that only slightly.    Maybe we were off-route? I'm not sure where else it could go. It would make little sense to suddenly traverse ten feet left.
    Jul 12, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Crusher,    I toproped the upper part of Threshold; see Threshold Variation.  The line I climbed on that route is left of My Way. See                        Threshold Variation.  Climb to the top of the pillar from the left. Start up the right side of the arete, then step left and climb face and cracks about 10' left of My Way.      .    In Rossiter's Boulder Canyon guidebook, the description for Threshold says "jam discontinuous handcracks just left of the arete."  My Way climbs cracks on the right side of the arete, and makes a move or two on the arete itself.    It may be possible to clip the second bolt of My Way from Threshold, but the climbing lines are distinct.  I can relocate the second bolt on My Way farther to the right so it would not be possible to clip from Threshold, if that would make you happy.

    Good climb. I needed to do a blind placement (0.5 cam) in a crack to the left (10-12' above the pedestal above the slot) before stepping left into the crack.  BTW, this climb looks like it covers similar terrain as  "The Threshold".  From the topo in Rossiter, it starts down and left of your route but then seems to be pretty much the same.  I can only assume it must climb left of My Way since it is rated 11b (although only a section of 10 is shown on the topo).

    I'd second Nick Wlder's comments about the 5.9 move after the last bolt but would say the offwidth boulder at the problem has a move also worth the grade if you stay inside the offwidth itself.    There is a loose block about parallel with the first bolt: as you clip in to the second bolt, it looks like a natural foothold but moves a little. There is a hollow flake after the last bolt that felt like it'll definitely come away some day but not today. Sounds like Sarah Meiser's climbing partner may have taken the worst of it off, but it's still fragile.    There's also a loose block on the right hand side as you are leaving the first finger crack: you'll see it. Fortunately, it's not even near where you need to be, but I touched it while investigating and it was very loose.     Having said the above, this is one of the best climbs in Boulder Canyon. If the area gets a little clearer of loose rock, the climb itself is exciting. If you're a beginner trad leader, having five bolts immediately beneath you lends a certain sense of reassurance. Just be careful to judge rock condition!

    I usually have no problem with a little choss, but in its current state, this climb is dangerous and not worth doing.

    Fun climb.  Started up it thinking it was a sport climb and had to lower the rope to get gear for the top.  It's weird as a mixed climb.  None of the bolts are really necessary as there is adequate gear the whole way up.  Should either be all bolts or no bolts (IMO).

    Recommend belaying to the far left (as you would for Edges and Ledges).  A bowling ball size rock came loose from the upper ledge and landed on the belay ledge directly in line with the route.  Luckily we were too lazy to move our belay from where we started.  Fun route otherwise!

    Really just one 5.9 move - from the last bolt your move from the easy wide crack to the face, which is a bit delicate.  A single 5.8 move at the top wide crack (just below the anchor) is also interesting (blue #3 Camalot - don't bother with the #4).  Otherwise easy and unremarkable climbing.

    Step up from flake on sidepulls into the bowl is a harder than average 11 and insecure at least maybe 11c/d?    However, you can get a cordalette tripled over and tied off behind the "spike" I mention triple and tied off so as to be sure that if you sever a strand or two, that you don't end up on the ledge. I'd say use Kevlar, not nylon.    There a yellow or green Alien at the start, which is probably 5.10, then the cord, then a few more Alien options and Camalot options here or there on the 5.10 climbing, which is continuous and insecure, then there is a a green Alien placement at the upper crux which might be 5.10+, so save one for that.    So there is some gear opportunity, but it is infrequent. Yeah, the route is 'R.'

    The route has cleaned up well enough, I guess. The initial placement is pretty high if you eschew the bolts down low for a trad route.... Then lots of gear but slightly flaky rock in a few spots. Not unsafe by any means.

    A single placement between 0.75" and 2" will be had between the last and second to last bolt if you feel that you want/need that. The climbing there is easier and, unless you are short, not very committing. If you take any given cam in that range, you ought to be able to find a placement for it. If you take the whole range, you could pack them all in there.

    I placed a #2 Friend and a 0.75 Camalot.  I think you would be ok with just the Camalot at the roof.  The bolt is not far above, and the moves from the bolt before the roof are not hard.

    This is a super easy / fun lead. You can place pro every 4 feet if you've got it. Save a couple pieces for the top though. You'll get to a ledge and want to walk to the left about 15 feet to the anchors of Mons. I placed a #3 right below the short face climb to the anchors.

    I wonder if this route would benefit by adding a bolt or 2 in now blank sections where all the rock was trundled off. The route is not the same as it was before.  The pro is very limited until you get higher, and you may have a groundfall depending on your placement. It would still be a good beginner lead and toprope, since there is still a set of anchors above it. Approval by R. Rossiter would be needed of course. Just a thought.

    I climbed the route a few days ago not knowing anything about its recent history. Climbing was never more than 5.4. However, there is now very little protection for the first 30' or so (small stoppers). When I got near the middle, I saw a lot of fresh dirt and realized there had been recent rockfall. I tested a flake on the left, and it vibrated when tapped, so I avoided it. I climbed to the right and then stepped left to look at the crack there and a very gentle left foot placement sent a large rockfall down--maybe a couple of hundred pounds. Fortunately, my belayer was well to the L of the line as I climbed it.    After that the protection was OK, a couple of large cams. I set a natural anchor at the top slinging a boulder.    Conclusion: this is a dangerous route with unstable rock features and difficult to protect for the first 30 feet.    rob.calm

    Just climbed it this morning as my first trad lead. Obviously the pine tree in the mid part is now gone. Instead there is dirt and a loose plate left -- don't pull it. The anchor is tall yet still reachable for 5'8". Or you might want to climb a little higher from the right side to set the rappel. Small cams are preferred.

    Unfortunately this is no longer as good a pitch for beginner trad leaders as it was before the rock scaling. The removal of that column of rock has left a few suspect holds, and the tree snapped off during the operation. It was once 'G' rated but now is probably 'PG-13' for a novice (good gear not as obvious or plentiful.)

    That loose rock noted by burnindaylight above is extremely loose. I wasn't aware of it before and tilted it out about 6" yesterday. I managed to shove it back in a panic.

    Bolt anchors recently added by Rossiter are nearly out of reach for short people.

    I think this would be a good lead for a beginner or for someone looking to build back confidence with trad (me in both cases!).  Be sure that your belayer is anchored - we used a sling around a big boulder at the base - since any falls before the first piece about 10 feet up would send you and your partner to the highway.  It's very consistent climbing, with no real crux  except for the top, which we went to the right of making for an easier finish (the same as for Mons, the  crack to the right).

    As has been mentioned before, it's a one-move wonder.  But that one move was trickier than I had expected.  The crack wasn't great for jamming (at least for someone with large hands like mine) being a bit flaring, smooth and at entirely the wrong angle.  Laybacks are possible but pumpy.  A better (cheating?) option is to reach up and about 2' right of the top of the crack to the jugs and just mantle it.  Nice climb, but far from the best at the rock.

    Very fun route with lots of variety on either side of the crack. However, be cautious of a sketchy rock, on right side of crack, past the crux, just below the big sloping ledge toward the top (see red circle on photo). The 3x1x1 ft block is not teetering but vibrates when you whack it. Placing protection behind or below it could jar it loose if you fell on it. Might also want to avoid the obvious handhold on it.                         Be aware of sketchy rock, circled in red. Not teetering but not especially strong.

    The anchors are in kind of an awkward place for leaders-- requiring 2-3 moves above a slanting ledge after the route feels like it's over.

    This is a fun route on really good quality rock.  It helps build confidence leading, and the crux, a small bulge half way up, is very well protected with a #6 hex (#0.75 Camalot maybe) and is also on good hand holds.

Lots of different lines can be taken and makes an awesome top rope for squeamish significant others to try their own skills on.

    Reasonable, small holds on beautiful rock.  I climbed the left dihedral until the second bolt, then traversed right about 10' finishing on the more steeply overhung right edge.  Maybe my fingers are just weak, but it felt like solid 9+ territory.  An easier route was found by sticking in the left edge for another ten feet then traversing over in the middle of the bulge.      If you toprope this one, watch the swing from the left side.  It's scary, whipping your rope across the rock (from the admirable, new anchors) and dangling you above the traffic.  Exciting to say the least!

    In response to the comments about the new anchor....    3/8" bolts are absolutely fine for belay/rappel anchors.  They have a pull-out strength of over 5000 pounds if properly installed and are not subject to the dynamic loading of a protection bolt.    We left the original bolts in place because some people still belay from the top of a climb, rather than lowering off, and the existing bolts are fine for that.  We did not just pull the existing bolts and re-drill because the bolts were too far back from the edge and would have required 2+ feet of chain on each bolt.

    Not to diminish the importance of the fine work you did by placing 2 bolts at the crest of the top, but why not remove the other three when you were there?  I can understand not using the old holes as unsightly slings would still be required to reduce rope drag over the edge but why leave the old bolts that have now been rendered obsolete?    You set a good example of community service for others to follow.  Any takers?

    Good work Bruce.  Are there now 5 bolts at the anchor? Could you have removed the existing bolts and re-drilled the old holes and placed 1/2" bolts?  Either way, thanks for the replacement.  Are the RAwl (aka Power) bolts you placed stainless steel or plated, and how long 21/4", 3", or 31/2".  Do you think it's necessary to place SS bolts in granite?

    Dale Haas and I, with approval from the first acent party, fixed up the anchor on top of this route.

They appreciate your support.    A couple of notes on the other bolts on the climb.  The final protection bolt has, mistakenly, been called a 1/4" bolt.  It is in fact a 3/8" wedge anchor.  Also, the three bolts that comprise the old anchor are Rawl "Spike" bolts.  It  appears that they are 5/16" in diameter.    Happy climbing!

    Hey Joe B., how tall are you anyways? This route goes at a solid 5.9+ in my book. The tiny side-pulls and crimpers from the bottom to the third bolt aren't exactly 5.9 material. Granted, after the third bolt the holds are comparatively huge... Either way, great climb to try out. The bolts are nice and close for the crux (the first is even easily skippable). If leaders are TR-ing this one for friends, leave one or two QDs on the route so the second doesn't swing way south after a fall. They'd have to be lowered all the way down to get back on route generally.~Wm

    I climbed this route today and found it to be a top quality route, blemished unfortunately by the sketchy three bolt top anchor. I found the slings currently in use to be too short, putting the rings over the top edge leading to bad rope drag. I'd suggest removing the old top anchors and placing new ones a couple of feet down or using long chains. The final bolt on the route, just below the top anchor is a quarter incher due for replacement as well. Otherwise a real pleasure of a sport route.

    It's peculiar that whoever put the bolts on this climb left the dubious anchor at the top.  The anchor is scary, and it's a shame for such a nice climb.  I would replace the anchors if someone loaned me a drill.....send me an email if interested.  It would only take a few minutes and would make the route so much more pleasant.

    A fun, thoughtful little climb.  The "anchor" at the top is shite and in dire need of an upgrade (Fred??... Heidi??).  It would be considered a bad anchor in the desert!See the gear alert.    The anchor consists of three rusty quarter inchers, equalized with slings.  This would be considered a bad anchor even by obscure desert tower standards.  Back things up with small to medium cams if you plan on TRing.  For cleaning: best not to lower off the anchor... rap instead.

    A really grat route, although I am not sure why the nostalgic anchors are still in place, those are scary. This route has a SUPERB photo-op on a beautiful sunny day, blue sky behind the arete looking down the canyon around the 4th bolt. A beauty..... Enjoy.

    I would have to agree with everything that KCP just stated. Perhaps most important is the fact that this thing is really fun. 12a? 11d? Meh, whatever.  I did onsight it but didn't downgrade it...I guess I have a lot to learn about being a Boulderite. Next time I will have to channel my inner eight year old and get all grumpy about the bolting; perhaps then I can comfortably call it 11a.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Just did this route again, after a three-year climbing hiatus, and it took several tries after a month of fitness training. Then I did it two more times - once as a warm-up, and once at the end of the day. 12a feels more accurate than 5.11. It's definitely not 11b or c. I've climbed hundreds of routes in those ranges, all over the map, so I have a pretty good idea what they feel like. It would be interesting to know how many calling this route mid-5.11 actually onsighted it. I'm inclined to believe that it wasn't many, and for those who did, it wasn't near their limit. All routes feel easier when we wire them. The Web felt like 5.11 when I finally sent it.    More importantly, the moves are classic and sustained all the way to the traverse up high, and then it's still interesting. Clipping the chains is not a giveaway if you're pumped and at your limit on this route. The bolts, overall, are a bit closely spaced, although this takes nothing away from the quality of climbing, nor does the route's proximity to the road.    As a friend used to constantly remind me, too much comparative analysis can suck the fun out of almost anything worth doing.

    Last time I was at this route, an 8 year old girl looked at it for a minute with a puzzled look on her face.  She then turned to me and said in a confused voice, "Why are there so many bolts on that route?"  I about spit out the water I was drinking.      If an 8 year old girl thinks it's over-bolted, you know it is.  At the crux, there is a bolt at your feet, knees, and face.

    +1 to TB.  A great route.  It seems odd to me that so many would turn up their noses regarding traffic noise.  It is sport climbing at the Bowling Alley, after all.   I think that 11d/12a makes sense if you stick to the bolt line; I believe that many cheat left at both the lower and upper crux.

    I am surprised that this route does not get better ratings.  The rock quality is pretty darn good (most of the route is bullet hard granite), and there are lots of thoughtful movements. Many people seem to bash the noise and fumes from cars passing by, but most people including myself go to The Bowling Alley to get a quick workout when they are short on time. If you want to be further away from the road, well just look at the million other crags in the area that sit high above the road.  This route gets 3 stars and, in my opinion, is one of the better routes at The Bowling Alley.

    The low crux, on review, wasn't bad at all, just tenuous.  Actually the second was the same.  I felt that the moves were very footwork and body position dependent, not so much strength.

    This makes a reasonable climb to do some quick aid practice, right by the road.  You can basically climb the entire pitch as a bolt ladder, with a few mandatory free moves that are pretty easy, but still require getting out of the aiders.  Don't need any gear besides draws when done this way with a few easy free moves.
    Mar 28, 2007

    11d/12a sounds most accurate. It is a beautiful route, with nice dihedral moves at the begining, stellar face climbing in the middle and juggy cruiser moves at the top. For the rock and the moves, it's classic, and for the lazy person or time crunched like myself, the close proximity to the road is a good thing.

    The nut on the sixth bolt (protecting the second crux) is loose. I was only able to finger tighten it today.    Two stars despite the route's proximity to the road. Sustained, very puzzling climbing. Even after I wired the cruxes, it felt like .11d to me. And when you think the climb's over (after the mantle to the rest ledge and a few juggy moves) there's a surprise before the anchors.

    If I were sending pals to the crag I'd tell them this is one of the better routes, so I'll give it 2 stars. As for difficulty, I found it not so bad except for the one left hand side pull around the 4th bolt, which also is not so bad once you find it right.  Felt easier than the route just to the right, "Centennial" (11c/d).
    May 21, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Excellent route with some problem solving.  Would be a three star if it weren't so close to traffic noise.  Myself and two friends did the lower crux differently a couple days ago.  The upper crux was good for me.  I almost hung because of the difficulty of the clip, but I downclimbed three moves pseudo-rested and then went back up and did it.  It was one of those spots and moments where you can screw yourself by having a negative mindset: thinking about a fall, fear, etc...but it was good for me because I was able to keep that at bay.  Maybe that's why I liked the line so much.

    This route has some great moves.  The highway noise is as bad as it gets, but then that's what you'd expect with a 50 foot approach.      There is a big ledge about 60 feet up the route.  The headwall above this ledge has a tricky move above the 2nd bolt (8th bolt overall).  The belayer cannot see the leader at this point, plus there is a good amount of rope stretch so a fall can result in the leader hitting the ledge.    The right to the left, Splitting Hares, has a similar upper headwall above a ledge with a hard move at the first bolt.  Be careful here too.

    This is a climb that you want to make it to the third bolt on. I'd say it's a PG-13 until the 3rd bolt. After that, the slab will not harm you. I am a little thrown off by the Wolverine Boulder Canyon guidebook because of its 10a rating. Especially at the crux, I'm convinced it's at least a 10d, maybe even 11a.

    The lowest part of the flake between the third and fourth bolt blew off on me last night.  It was about the size of a football, so luckily my belayer was not hit.

    I agree with Nick, This thing is way harder than 10a right off the deck. From the last bolt to the anchors is solid 10a, moving left and then back right. Don't blow any of the clips.

    Short and sweet.  A 10 second approach!  The crux seems to be initially getting onto the rock.   Also, you may want to climb left a bit to reach the 4th bolt.  Somewhat awkward anchor stance....

</blockquote><blockquote>
    The first move isn't worse than .10a/b if you can stem your feet and make a controlled move to the horn next to the first bolt.  The top section, if you follow the bolt line, feels all of .10d, however.  Even clipping the anchors feels a touch tenuous.

    I can't see how the move off the ground, straight up past the bolt, is less than 10d, and I would have guessed 11a if I hadn't read about it beforehand.  No way it's 9 - no matter what you do at the top of the route.

    Good quick one on a cold morning - in the sun from the east. Indeed watch the ground fall, which is why I'd say R or S. I'd say 10d straight up from the 2nd bolt, and 10a (R) if you go left. You don't want to fall from out left, before you clip the 3rd bolt, but it is definitely easier that way.

    This is a pretty nice route, and its proximity to the road makes it a good project for short late-summer days.  The slab moves before the crux--around the sixth bolt--are tricky and interesting.  Here's my crux beta:  after clipping the seventh, step up to the good right foot and match the arete undercling (this may break off eventually) to get the left hand on it.  Now reach off straight to the right; there is a somewhat invisible poor whitish quartz sidepull there.  Using this you can stand on your right foot.  Ignore the bolt at your face; clip it after the move.  Pause a moment and throw with the right hand to get the jug as you are falling outward.  If you catch it, you're done. It seems pretty clean as of late 2009.

    Really fun route, but stuff is still breaking off. Be careful after the last bolt! When I was belaying, my partner's (rather large) foothold broke off and landed one foot to the left of me. Scary! The start is pretty loose, too, and I even managed to break a small crystal I was using as a finger hold on the slab. Once this things sees a little more traffic and gets cleaned up, it will make a great addition to the canyon. Very sustained, yet various types of moves.

    Onsighted this route today and absolutely loved it. Definitely something I will climb again. Awesome moves from hand jams, finger jams, liebacks, and crimps. Went up without gear and did not even notice any runout. Seemed pretty safely bolted to me. At any rate I would def. reccomend doing this route.

    Climbed it today after backing off it last week. My partner/son led it and did a great job. I was a little freaked out. The area from the 3rd to 5th bolt seemed off balance and did not have a lot of real secure hands. Final headwall was cool, although the kid said that was the scariest part on lead. We did the crux differently. He found a two finger hold from which to clip bolt 5, I jammed the crack until able to reach the Thank God holds above. I'll be thinking about this one until I can come back and lead it in good style.

    5.10a/b is good. There are plenty of opportunities for good rests with the features behind you. I was fine without any gear, but if this is near your limit bring some, because falls looked like they would not be clean. Overall a fun climb with lots of cool jams and stemming moves.

    10a/b is right on. Excellent pitch, worth doing. I am a chicken, and don't think you really need extra gear, except you might want to stick-clip the first bolt if you don't want the risk of a broken ankle.

    There are now 8 bolts on this route. We felt comfortable leading this without additional gear, although a 1" to 1.5" cam could be placed between the 4th and 5th bolts.    An enjoyable route; great stemming in the lower corner and a fun headwall at the top.

    So as per request of Dan Hare I put a new set of 3/8" stainless steel anchors with rings at the top of Zee Eliminator, he asked me to do it on the ledge to hopefully get some more folks interested in the route. I also trundled the loose, massive, wedged block sitting about 3/4 up the route in the crack, so it's pretty splitter now!

    I would second Ken Leiden's comments about the upper pitch. Not nearly as good as the first but worth doing if up on the ledge warming up.    You can avoid the guano if you head left at the headwall instead of moving right to the pillar. Careful hand placement on the pillar would probably work also, but it'd be tough to see the correct spot from below.    More fun as a warm-up than Termites.

    This route is really fun! If the upper headwall was only longer, say 80 feet of that slightly overhanging crimping, it would be mega-classic. Still quite a nice route with memorable and fun moves. Probably one of the better routes I have done at this crag. It reminded me just a little tiny bit of the face moves on Lucid Creaming. Big moves to positive but small holds. I think most people would agree and smile after doing this crux, it's brilliant!!

    There is a left-leaning, slightly gaston crimp 10" down from the jug.  I was able to go to it and then bump to the top.  My left foot is backstepped on the previous crimp.  But for me (6', +2) it's easy enough to just go all the way.  Deadpoint at least, might call it a dyno.

    Easily the best route at the Bowling Alley in my opinion; it would be clasic if the first half was 5.12 instead of 5.10.    By the way, what's with all this talk of dynoing?  I locked off on a sidepull crimp and used a little momentum, definitely not a dyno.

    This route is great with two dynamic moves in a row. Careful when you throw the dyno, it's easy to over toss for it. Also, after I make the first right hand lunge to the sidepull and stack my left hand under my right on the tiny edge, I set my feet to the right and dyno up with my left hand. This beta worked well for me.  And  to whoever stole my biners off the top of this route I say, "You, my cheap conscienceless sociopath, are a tool!".

    From the large horizontal at the second/third bolt, is it possible to face climb straight up and left (avoiding the crack) in order to avoid the hollow flake altogether. An easy hand rail traverse then gets you back right to the bolt above the flake. This bumps the grade up but is a safer variation.

    I didn´t know about the moving flake when I climbed this today for the first time. When I fully grabbed the flake and felt how it was moving, I got a little sketched out.  The flake will go eventually. Don´t yank (outwards) on it. Fun route!

    Did this last night and thought that the route is pretty solid 11 a/b. The pic shows a zag to the right below the undercling, I went straight up the seam then stepped over to the undercling. Pretty thin climbing here, could warrant the 11c that it is rated in the guidebook for a short person.

    This was a really fun route with cool movement. Moving past the undercling will allow you to feel the pump! I sat on the ledge about 15 feet above the undercling to shake it out for a few minutes.  I onsighted it, and have not done very many 11s, so I would guess low 11. Maybe after I've done a few more I will rate the grade. If you're in the area do it!

    This is a fun route, it's probably easier for people with small fingers.  It's a bit scary when using the undercling flake, since it moves as you pull on it.  And clipping the bolt higher up on this flake you can hear a hollow sound....

    This felt much easier than 5.11c, 11a sounds closer. If you avoid the obvious undercling then the line might go at 5.11c. But this appears to be seldom done with the flake and undercling at hand's reach.
    Nov 13, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Myke, et al., about the 5.11 rating you give this climb: I don't agree with it at all. There is very little chance someone not strong on 11s would get this route on the onsight, which I assume is NOT what you grade routes at. Once you have done the route 30 times, surely it gets easier, but by no means is this 11, a solid 11b, with several 5.11 moves in the mix. As for traversing to the underclings, it surely does ease the climbing, but overal maybe by a letter or 2 at most.
    Oct 1, 2001

    I don't think one could argue that traversing right to the crack undercling and sidepull is off.  However, it's pretty fun and interesting to climb the majority of this route just left of the crack system.

    I definitely questioned the intensions of the FAist on this route.  Other than pulling through the bulge at the second bolt, there was nothing worthwhile about it.  Up above, it wandered aimlessly, entered the gully, then climbed the arete with a ledge and dirt for feet, and having to reach way around the corner to get to the hand holds.  It could have been designed much better to create a better route, in my opinion, or left out all together.

    A confusing start. The leftmost set of large, angled sloper-rails do not lead anywhere. Aim up and to the right for a couple decent hand-holds, find a foot, and go up and left. Stay off the arete for the 10c/d route. If you go further right, to scramble into the gully and then come left, and if you use the arete the rest of the way up, that is more like a 5.7.

    If you follow the natural weakness in the rock, this route is more like 5.8 or .9 R. Once you are are over the roof, the climbing is easier, but there is no protection for a while.

    10 or 10+ sounds about right. It was pretty dirty and needed a good cleaning. For lack of a brush, I gave it a poor cleaning with my hands while on lead. The moves are actually pretty good and quite fun. The detractors of this climb are the modest length, the ledge at mid-height that breaks up the climbing, and the relatively dirty nature of the climb (smears are scaley and lichenous). The last of these is mitigated somewhat after the most recent set of ascents, but the route still needs a good brushing.    Anyway, it deserves some more cleaning and some more ascents.

Definitely use a 70m rope, my old 70 had maybe 10-15 feet on the start ledge.    I think the bolting on the top slab is kind of cool, you can climb either side of the slab and the bolts protect fine. I went up right for the first half, then traversed at a bolt to the arete/cracks/fin, nice exposure and climbing.

    I just watched a woman get lowered off the end of her rope on this route.

She said she felt dizzy. Her partner was driving her straight to the hospital.    Always tie a knot in the end of your rope to prevent what happened. I am glad to see the above route description mentions this climb is 105 feet &amp; may require a short downclimb when you run out of rope.    In my guidebook "Boulder Canyon Sport &amp; Adventure Climber's Guide - Volume II", the topo drawing shows the lowering distance of 105 feet for this route &amp; Lucky Strike. On the other hand, Bob D'Antonio's guidebook "Boulder Canyon Rock Climbs" just says "12 quickdraw &amp; a 60m rope" for both this route &amp; Lucky Strike.

    You can easily make this route easier than 5.11.  The top is 5.11 if you go directly up the bolt line.  We went to the right and it was easier.  We thought it was about 10c in difficulty at about the 5th or 6th bolt, can't remember which.

    Fixed hardware is okay, just a way to highlight this comment.     I've been meaning to report a safety issue regarding this route.    About half way up the route, ten feet or so before you turn the corner to the slab thing, there is a block that you sort of hug or stem around.     Off to the left there is another block that you can use to stem for your left foot. The block is loose and ready to fall on your belayer and roll down onto the highway. It's about the size of a large microwave.    This may be four to six bolts up ([can't] remember), but it is also the first section where your on your arms a little. Try to stay right.    I can't think of any way to safely [remove] this thing because simply prying it off may cause it to roll all the way down the hill.     Please, BE CAREFUL.

    This is a fun, but contrived climb.  The top slab is probably not 11, but depends very much on the line you take.  It helps rope drag to use a sling or double draws on the 4th and 6th bolts.

    This is a typically contrived Boulder Canyon route. If you climb the natural line and clip all the bolts, there is no way this route is 11a. It is probably closer to 5.9. Ken thought 10c, so maybe I'm overreacting. I guess there were some hard moves. The crux is supposedly the finishing slab, but you'd have to get someone up there to tape off the illegal holds to make this 11a. There are big holds on the right and left side of the blank slab with the bolts. I was never more than an arm length off the bolt line. How ridiculous. Nevertheless, it makes a nice warm-up.

    I wouldn't give it an R rating, but a couple of the bolts are pretty badly placed if you are short (there is no reason they couldn't be an inch lower, and their height makes you do a move prior to clipping way above the last bolt...).

    This climb is much better than it looks and well worth doing - especially if you need a short approach.  It is quite beta intensive and would be a very hard onsight.  The hand jam at the very top is less painful if done with the right hand.  This also sets up well for the top out.

    For those looking for a little more interest on this excellent route, try it placing gear. I skipped the first two bolts easily with a 1.5 friend at the first crux. I clipped the next two bolts and then placed a good stopper before the reach to the reinforced hold. The next bolt could be skipped but I clipped it and then placed a #3 friend in the last slot at the lip to bypass the last bolt. So in all 3 out of 7 bolts were used and two of these could probably be skipped as well. All the pieces I placed were really good.

I think Its a tricky route for an onsight, but not too bad for the redpoint because you can really learn to milk the rests on this thing if you want to (or in my case need to).  No-hands rests are possible at the 3rd, 4th, and 6th bolts, although climbing into the slot at the 6th bolt feels like cheating so I try to avoid it.  The hard move at the 5th bolt (what Aron is talking about) is made considerably easier by using an undercling with the left hand -- it never has chalk on it so most people must not do it this way.  The hand jam at the 7th bolt is made considerably easier by using a knee bar with right leg to brace the left knee against the left wall.  Using these tricks, I don't even need to pretend I'm that Sven dude.    Update 8/16/2007: the secret undercling at the 5th bolt has broken off making this move harder.

    I actually find no aspect of this route difficult and feel 5.11d is more appropriate. I also feel that the top move is not really painful and using a spyder mitt to do it is gay! Not that there is anything wrong with that.

    I climbed this once a long while back, and unlike the rest of the people talking about this route, I didn't find the top the crux. While that move was really tough, the move that help me up again and again was getting onto the slabby block about 1/2 way up the climb. Maybe I'm just not flexable enough.

    I climbed this route today and had the same experience Bill had. Once you get the jam there is this little something stabbing you in the back of your hand. I myself had no spyder mitt, so for just one moment, I decided to be like that Sven guy that can't pump himself enough on this website, and [very briefly]became more manly. This fleeting infusion of "Sven-focus" allowed me to make the painful pull to the crimp. Bill, when you get back from Yosemite you must make your hand more "Sven-like" but only for just one moment, and the route shall fall! I would suggest a hammer and a small pebble to pound into the back of your hand as initial "Sven-training" for this route.

    This is a great route for your first 5.12. I'm trying to make it my first 5.12. The protection is excellent - you're nearly on a toprope for most of the climb. I really like the variety of moves on this pitch.     The hand jam move at the top is the crux for me. I recommend taping up your left hand. If this move is at your limit (as it is for me), if you fall off this move you'll get a big of a gobie on the back of your hand that will hinder further attempts. Since taping for one jam (there are two other jams that I use on this route, but no tape is necessary there) is a hassle, I wear a Spyder Mitt on just my left hand - sort of the Michael Jackson look. It works great and makes the crux hand much more comfortable and solid. Of course, some of my friends claim this is aid...

    This climb does not look very good from the ground, but it is sustained and is the best short 5.12 I have done in Boulder Canyon.  It would also make a great first 5.12.  None of the moves are all that hard, good clipping stances, and the bolts are very close together.

    Getting to the third bolt is a little scary, but the falls are clean if your belayer is on top of it. Also, clipping the second bolt provides some opportunity for injury, though this is certainly not the crux of the route. Much harder than Bad Girls Get Spanked.

    The flake about half way up (there is a bolt on the flake itself) makes a hallow sound. It is a really big flake, and it would cause considerable damage if it came off.

    I figured that the bolts in the slab are belay bolts.  This minimizes rope stretch so you wont deck on the slab.

But, I won't even start criticizing the bolting jobs in this area....

    Did this today. It was about 35 degrees, maybe less. Good route. Tricky moves traversing left above the roof and then up. Very sustained, then easier but strenuous tothe top. It felt much harder than the two other 11s I did today in this area, Oil Pan Hook Shot 11a/b and Assault of the Earth 11a on Cornerstone. Also much harder than a several 11a or b sport routes at Security Risk last week. If this were trad ratings, I would agree with 10d/11a, but compared to other sport climbs I've done recently, 11b/c seems correct. Of course all those other 11a/b sport climbs could have been overrated.    Does anyone else feel the two bolts on the slab leading to the wall are ridiculous? The move onto the slab is maybe 5.4, 10 feet off the ground. I don't think a 5.11 climber (even a sport climber :-)) needs a bolt for that. The second bolt, on the flat slab, might be useful for a short person clipping the third bolt at the lip. BTW, clip the third bolt with a locking biner to minimize the chance of hitting the slab clipping the 4th bolt.
    Jan 11, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I thought the climb was harder than .10d -- although easier than the .11b/c rating it receives in Rolofson's guidebook. Maybe .11a if you head for the jug above and to right of the 5th bolt and hand traverse left to the 6th bolt.    It does,however, merit Rolofson's PG-13 rating. Blow the somewhat tricky 4th clip and you'll deck on the initial slab (even with a very short draw on the 3rd bolt).

    Mark,    Sure, if you want a bunch of crap cluttering up the hanger, you don't need to replace the ring, but why put yourself in that situation in the first place?  Just use replaceable hardware to begin with.

</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>
    Bruce, it is simply not true that you have to replace the whole hanger when the ring wears out on a Fixe rap hanger. The hanger has enough room to add quicklinks with chains or winch hooks. I did this on the "Other One" at Sport Park.    As for as this climb is concerned, I don't wander out right of the bolts on the line of least resistance, but rather climb straight up the face slightly left of the lower bolts &amp; then right along the bolts. This makes for a nice 5.10a. The line of least resistance is 5.9. Because the route is closely bolted, there is no intimidation factor. This explains the MP consensus 5.8 rating to a large extent.
    Aug 11, 2017
</strong></blockquote><blockquote>
    On high traffic routes, the best solution is to use easily replaceable hardware such as two quicklinks or a quicklink and a rappel ring per bolt.  Using hangers with rings means that when the rings wear you have to replace the entire hanger. That's not too difficult for wedge bolts as long as the threads on the end of the bolt are fine, but this can be a problem with Powers 5-piece bolts where it is difficult to get the correct torque on the bolts when re-tightening them.
    Feb 21, 2016

    I'll jump on the comments bandwagon.... With that said, the crack feature is at most 2-ft to the right of the bolt line, which is HARDLY off route. Unless you have the reach of an infant, it would be assinine to call it off-route. By off-routing the crack, you've turned a quite enjoyable climb into an eliminate, and that BS only flies at Morrison. The crack is on. We could come up with every variation under the sun by saying, "it's 5.XX if you ignore this and 5.XX if you don't use that." Heck, you could call it 5.14 if you ignore all positive hands and feet and just use smears and slopers using nothing but vaseline for your hands in place of chalk.

    This one was a little weird for me. It definitely depends on the line you take, and the line I took was probably a stiff 8+, maybe a 9-. That said, I think conditions play a role. We climbed it on a cold windy day, and numb hands definitely spice it up a little. On a warmer day, I could definitely see this going at 8. If you're comfortable on good friction and small seams for feet, then this route is pretty killer. If you're just breaking into 5.8, then this may not be the route for you

    Climbed it yesterday on a beautiful, busy day. We got blown off a couple of harder climbs earlier, and I 'd always wanted to do it. Quality route; 5.8- use caution at the second clip.

    What a great climb! Commenting here in part to say that I'm surprised at the 9+ ratings that this is receiving. I'd suggest 8+ ... perhaps 9- at most.

    Apr 25, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Ratings are subjective, naturally, and depend on the exact line you choose, your height, etc. But a 5.8 leader would not be happy with a 5.8 rating, I suspect. Definitely harder than the "Bowling ball and chain" route, which is supposedly 10a, but nowhere near as hard as "Splitting Hares," also supposedly 10a/b. Very fun pitch, worth doing, no matter what it is rated.
    Oct 7, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I see a lot of these routes being rated for elimination moves, recently.    Betsy and I just did this route, today, and the path of least resistance, which essentially follows the bolt line within a foot or two on either side, is no harder than 5.8. There is no 5.9 or 10 move on the route unless you eliminate the holds. The only local route that I can compare this one to is "Deck Chairs on the Titanic", at Table Mountain, and Titanic is considerably harder at 5.9. And if anyone needs some perspective of what a consensus 10a slab feels like, go do Bolting for Glory, in Eldo.     For beginning leaders, the only clip that concerns me is the second one above the opening roof. It's not a difficult clip, although the feet might feel insecure for a new leader, and blowing it would land you on the low angle slab below. That could be an ankle breaker. Once that bolt is clipped, the rest of the route is "well" protected and enjoyable.

    Rockfall warning!  Beware of rock fall at the base of this climb.  Sitting on the rock bench, my partner and I barely avoided disaster as several large (50-60 lbs) rock pummeled this area seemingly spontaneously from just right of the anchor.  Fortunately no one was hurt, but several of the rocks were definitely widow makers.  There was no wind or rain at the time and no one else was around so I have to assume a fair amount of instability above this climb.  Use caution!!!

    Great route. The Crux is definitely at the beginning. I made the mistake of using the dihedral crack on the left at first and had to downclimb to reach the bolt I missed.

    This route is awesome. It's a pretty sustained fun climb. The crux is definitely towards the bottom, but easily gotten past. I didn't notice that the anchor was wearing down. It's possible I just looked over it, but could it be that it was fixed?

    Just a fun route. Go do it if in the area. You can certainly make it harder or easier depending on the exact line. If you use the left dihedral to help with the first moves it is a lot easier. If you use the right open corner as you move higher, again much easier. I stuck to following the bolts fairly directly though was forced to move  somewhat right of the bolts as i got higher before the big ledge in the middle as i am still fairly new leader. For me felt like a challenging 5.8. but very fun. Just take your time and you will find what you need.
    Jun 27, 2004

    Yep, I'm jumping on the bandwagon and calling it a 5.9 due to the thin moves.  After a couple trips up and knowing where the friction lies and the crimps hide, one could argue an 8+ rating.  For the onsight though, I'm sticking with .9.  Fun route, nonetheless.

    I am new to this site and am somewhat confused as to what people mean by "a great beginner lead".  I am what I consider to be a beginning leader.  Mosquito Burrito was my third lead ever and my first 5.8.  This climb was a blast.  I found the move from the second to the third bolt to be thought provoking.  I needed my left foot to be where my right one was, and spent some time figuring out how I was going to do this.  The foothold was there but too small for me to match.  I have followed at higher levels and am not sure I would have had the confidence to lead this pitch if I had not done so. The climb is well protected once you clip into the second bolt and bolts are close enough together to give beginning leaders the mental strengh to reach the top.

    These anchors are starting to wear down. Until they get switched it is certainly prudent to TR or lower through your own gear and rap off the anchor when finished.

    The rating pretty much depends on the line you decide to take and how much of the seam you decide to use.  My buddy thought the 10a cruxes were near the last bolt and just below the ledge based on the line he took.  Based on what I did I thought it was 9+ish, just below the ledge.It's all a matter of degrees.

    Pulling direct through the overhang Right of the bolts was a 5.10a power move.  The guys on this prior to me called this a boulder-problem variation.      Coming in from the left on the start felt about 5.8.  For my own part, I got on the route and was amazed at the friction I was getting on the smears- it is some of the best around!    As for this being a great beginner lead, I've taught literally 100's of people to climb... I am used to beginners leading.  I put a novice leader on it last night (a 5.9+ climber) who on-sighted the climb as one of his first-ever leads. There seems to be very little chance or fear of serious consequence, even if the leader fails on the route at any point.    The bolts are spaced so close he could have Z-clipped, so it seams reasonably safe.  I did yell at him twice about getting his feet in the rope (he immediately moved both times).  Seems about par for the course.      I had not read these comments prior to climbing the route and I consider my opinions to be formed on my own.
    Jun 7, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Actually, it feels like 4th class...except if you follow the bolt line and keep your hands/feet off anything big, then it feels like 10a.  I would NOT call this a 'good beginner's lead' though since a bit of technique is required, including keeping the rope from behind your legs (a common beginner mistake).  Any fall on the 'lower angle slab', especially w/o a helmet, could be fatal.

    The new Rolofson book say that if you follow this route up on the right of the bolts (kind of using the arete) then it goes at 5.9. If, on the other hand, you climb directly up the bolt line its a 5.10a/b. The route is called Mosquito Burrito (I think). Either way, it's a great climb and harder than 5.8. I found myself edging to the right (easier 5.9 territory) and would agree with the 9 grade.

    Again what is up with the undergrading at this site? At the very least, even by Eldo standards this is 5.9. Very few 5.8 leaders will hike up the first 10 feet of this route without trouble. After the start, the grade is much more reasonable.

    First, would you add your name? It's a lot better to know who I'm talking to. I'm not sure what it's rated in the new book, but it's "severely" slabby. The moves take a little bit to figure out, but you could basically take a nap up there on any of the moves - it's so flat.

Do the first pitch, and clip chains to the right once you reach the ledge....

    I climbed this route many times since 1998. There are times when it hasn't seemed harder than 5.12b but this year it seems much harder to repeat than "Super Bon Bon" or "Shiny Dog".

    The second pitch of this route is a choss pile.  It is sketchy if not flat out dangerous reaching the first bolt after the break and the slab that follows drops down to about 5.8 until a dirty, flaky exit sequence presents itself.

It's a great training wall with much to offer. I am not condoning this route density at most crags, like really classic areas. Let's be real too, Dude. The bolts aren't 6 inches apart.

    Here's the scoop on "Shiny Dog".  After watching Chris Alber on this route in 1998, I have climbed it many times ever since.  Yes the route is squeezed, but it may be my favorite climb on this wall because there is no where to stop &amp; rest until your hands are in the horizontal crack above 5th bolt.  You don't use the large, drilled jug pocket on the neighboring route "Super Bon Bon", because if you do, it definitely changes the grade. You can hang out from this jug switch hands and shake out.  As for the start, I dyno up &amp; right with the left hand to a jug, then a few reasonable moves lead up left to 2nd bolt.  Some people climb the start to "Super Bon Bon" but avoid using the manufactured jug.  From a tips lieback hold below a sloping shelf, clip 3rd bolt and then reach (dyno)to a big edge and continue up the blunt arete.  At 4th bolt, stay on the arete. Your left foot goes on the big hold below the bolt, and then deadpoint to the horizontal crack. If you move right at the 4th bolt around the arete, it drops the grade slightly too.  It's a great training route for power endurance.

    So sad this line. It actually has cool powerful movement right off the deck. However the squeeze job of bolts all around it and the manufactured jug just kind of makes it a joke. I mean, every time I climb it I have fun. I guess you just have to laugh sometimes. It seems as though the person who bolted this sector really wanted to practice putting bolts in, 'cause there everywhere. If this was an independent line with no bolts to the right or left, minus the manufactured jug, it may have been an awesome route. 'Tis a shame....

    I thought the crux on this was down low.  I made it through the upper part which is supposed to be the crux.  The bottom took a lot of strength.  Maybe I am just not strong enough for it.

    A pretty fun route, but certainly too close to neighbors. As was said, stay right of the bolts (keep the bolts to your left) because if you climb this belly to the bolts, you'll have to decide which line of botls to clip. There are 4 routes within 3 meters. This one, Shiny Dog, ???, and Meteor Roadblock.Maybe as another poster suggested it's been a little overdone. The line is reasonably fun though, and a good warm-up for the 5.11 climber.

    Although this route isn't great to look at, it's interesting and surprisingly good. Personally I feel that the crux comes low moving past the 2nd bolt, although the upper move is also challenging.

    Routes on the Brick Wall are great for those who love the feeling of great friction on sparse but sometimes obvious crimpers. I felt that this route was a bit harder than 5.11 b/c and felt that some of the moves could have been as difficult as 5.12 a/b. The beginning of the climb is very enjoyable especially on a sunny spring day. The worst part of the climb is often the beginning moves because you may pendulum into some bushes on a toprope. As you climb up to the roof it does not appear to be particularly complex. Do not be fooled. For those who are under about five foot four you will find the roof to be extremely frustrating but can be solved with a three finger undercling and possibly a right heel hook depending on and individual's flexibility. After completing the arduos roof all of the possible crimps are obvious but you would be a bit more fortunate if it was a cold and friction-friendly day. To reach the anchors following the difficult prow the climbing is possibly easier than 5.8. The last time I climbed this route there was a small wired stopper stuck in a finger crack to the left of the acceptable finish. If an in-experienced intermediate or advanced climber is looking for a challenging and crimpy toprope problem, this route will feel like it was designed just for you.

    This is a really fun route, well worth 2 stars. There are three distinct  sections of difficulty:    1) A bouldery, bulge above the initial ramp. The gear is a bit tricky, but the stance below this section is fairly good, so take your time to get in a good nut  or small cam  before committing to the moves    2) Once above the bulge you enter a short but fun finger and hands left facing corner with greasy feet. Plenty of places for good gear and a good rest stance once above the difficulties. This rest is useful for     3)  A right angling thin hands crack takes you over the lip to the top of the Brick Wall. Once over the lip, traversing 20 feet or so takes you to some chains to lower off from. You can also top rope an 11ish face climb going up the middle of the Brick Wall from these anchors.. Please use your own slings off of the anchors while top-roping to avoid unecessary wear     The cruxes are short but all very different and at about the same grade. Definitely a fun pitch after work....    Josh Hemann    If other Boulder Canyon climbs like Curvin Crack and Classic Finger Crack get three stars, I  would certainly give this route at least two stars. The reasons:    -The route is longer than the above mentioned climbs and has three distinct cruxes (a bouldery, bulge start, a finger crack corner with greasy feet, and a thin hands roof to finish)    -Short approach if you decide not to belay from the car    -Can easily top rope the 11 face climb once you finish The Perfect Route.     So... If stars are supposed to convey to people the quality of the route and "climbing experience", I would recommend adding some stars to this route

    This reminded me of Question of Balance in Taylor Canyon, Gunnison.  Similar rock slickness, similar length (this is a little longer), similar increase in severity as you go higher, similar failure for me on both (couldn't get the last few moves, glad I was on toprope!).

    If you blindfolded me on the drive/approach, then put me on this climb, I would have told you that we were in Vedauwoo. I have big hands, so it felt like 5.9 but in the most physically burly way possible.     Easier than Black Crack though.

    Pretty physical for 5.9...I guess maybe "Castle Rock 5.9" (think The Black Crack).   I think folks with small hands will find this to be significantly harder.

    I would like to watch a dozen good climbers do this one and see how they do it.  I guess 12c is maybe an exageration, I was able to get it first go on TR (although absolutely barely).  All total, I am 5/6 on it (fell on #5 last night, much swearing), but man is it hard as hell. I always feel like I am falling off of every move through that first 2 bolts off the ledge.    I am curious about Tony's comments about the small holds - I couldn't figure out how to use anything other than pretty decent holds.  Mostly just the direction of them and the utter lack of feet is what makes it hard to be confident on this one.
    Jun 20, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Ouch! I was able to TR this route without falling when we put it in. Since my climbing ability was already in decline by then, I doubt I could climb 5.12c. I believe we did not rate it 5.12a either. Whatever the rating, it is a really good climb. You should have seen how much lichen was there when we started.
    Jun 20, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I would have to disagree with the assumption that this route is easier if you are tall.  The brutal undercling/laybacking would probably favor a shorter person.  I thought this thing felt closer to 12c than 12a.  I was really surprised at how hard it is, compared to other 12a's by the same FAs.    Overall, a good route.  Would be a 3 star route if the shit was cleaned off of the best holds and some lichen was scrubbed.

    This climb is a lot better than it looks from the ground. We used a #1 Camalot in the horizontal.... Though if you get here and you have no cams, I think it wouldn't be too ballsy to do without the piece. Hard and sequential.

    This route is pretty stiff and would be a really tough OS.  I found that it was slick and dusty, so hard to hold onto, but mosly solid and not crumbly like some other area routes.  The layback flake is quite thin, and the best holds are not obvious.  At the end of the crux sequence, the "jug" is just out of reach for a guy my height (5'10"), and I suspect that there is a strong dividing line for difficulty vs. height on this one.  Also, being light probably helps, as some of the holds are viciously small for the power you have to put on them.

    How did I spend so much time at Castle Rock over the last couple of years without getting on this? A mystery to be sure, but this climb is just pure fun. A combination of varied crack technique with intricate, sequence-based footwork through an overhang, it's one of those sequences that seems like such a puzzle that it's hard to believe it wasn't created by a route-setter at the Spot.    Heads up, after the crux I got up into the chimney and set loose a swarm of weird bugs. A sunny winter day after the frost/cold has thinned the bug population would be a more optimal time to hop on.

    The landing has been leveled, and there is no need for the R rating any longer.     I don't really know how to feel about the extensive landscaping that took place here. On one hand, I'm grateful to finally have a terrific warmup on perfect rock with a safe landing zone. On the other, the landscaping totally changes the nature of this climb and the bold, visionary, first ascent will never again be pause for reflection when one contemplates this line.     I hope that in the future, when traffic and erosion dictates trail building, people (or counties) will consider all resources before building ten foot wide trails at the bases of rock formations.

    If you start down low in on a crimp rail system, below where the original line traverses, and make a huge dynamic toss that reconnects the original line it's more like (V6)!!  It's a cool move that is put's a new face on this already classic line.    Also moving off this same crimp rail up and left via smaller but positive crimps adds another cool variation that's about (V4) or so.

    Completed the left crack (according to the pictures and description) with Eddie as it looked longer and more fun. All placements were bomber, and the smallest gear used was only a black Alien, which probably could have even been avoided. Mostly yellow TCU/Alien-sized pieces, I think we used 3. Overall a very fun (and extremely awkward) little pitch, with the old Star Drive at the lip probably being the sketchiest part of the whole affair.     This is also a great place to go if you want to get out but it's raining/snowing. It rained hard the entire time we were there, but the roof is, well, a large roof and does its job quite well!

    I solo aided this route today during the snow storm, it stays really dry.    I used anything from a blue Lowe Ball and larger micro nuts up to a #3.5 and even a hook near the top. I took the right side line with the bolts but decided it was never really necessary to clip them.  The right side seemed like it might be harder as an aid line as the placments were often flared out, which the left side did not seem to have the same issue.  I found that I used my yellow/red and yellow/green Alien hybrids quite a bit near the lip.  C2? (I have no idea)

    Cleaning the routes is easier than leading them IF:1)you place pro every couple of feet. Do Not place pro at your farthest reach.2)you RE-AID the pitch. The pro is in place, no jumars, clip and go, backup your self

    The left hand crack goes at A2+ with Lost Arrows and Angles or can be done cleanly at C3 wtih Lowe Balls and small TCUs.  It's definitely a notch up in difficulty from the right hand crack and quite fun.I believe the A4 branches off the left hand line and certainly appears to be dicey.      As a word of encouragement, if you can aid the C1 roof without clipping the bolts and get up CCC in under a couple hours, you probably have the necessary aid skills to do a starter big wall in Zion or Yosemite.    Also, it's worth noting that cleaning either line is probably harder than leading them.

    It's a bummer that your QDs got stolen, man. However,Castle Rock is primarily a trad area and getting stuff stolen is something to take into consideration when leaving gear behind in areas where such practice is rare (unlike sport-crags). I think that taking the bolt hangers, though, is a much worse offense because its affects go beyond one or two folks trying to free the route.  In the particular case of Aid Roof, the bolts really don't matter because it's still just C1.  But imagine someone aiding a route with rivets and/or bolts and then rappelling it to chop/take them out.  Suddenly, a section of C1 or C2 turns into a C3+(or worse) horror show with continuous top-step bat-hooking. Sure, these climbs exits but for a novice aid climber expecting C1 bolt ladders...      I greatly respect anyone who even attempts to free these kinds of climbs. And just because some hard working free climbers left gear doesn't automatically mean it is booty.  I doubt that the dude who stole those QDs and hangers ever attempted to free the line.  Sure, the draws might be a little unsightly, but their presence on such a badass route is much more inspirational than annoying.

    Comparing the addition of bolts to this route to those on CCC is not fair. CCC was put up when there was crap for gear and free climbing was not what it is today.    While I am a far cry from sending this route free, I have climbed similar features such as Separate Reality or Welcome To China (near Gunnison) where placing gear and having the rope get in the way of my feet was a large part of the difficulty. My guess is that some of these difficulties are why the bolts were added to this route, as the A1 gear is foolproof. I would like to think that in 50 or 100 years climbers will be cruising this thing and will laugh at whoever put the bolts in.    That said, I am more impressed with this as a free route than bummed about the bolts. It's an odd idea to reduce a route by adding bolts while improving the route by freeing it; maybe someone else can improve upon the syle.

    No I have not tried the roof free, but that is irrevelent. I think that there are very little odds of the gear 'welding' into place (this assumes that the gear is well placed). Have you freed or aided the roof to see what gear is available? I disagree with leaving natural pro in the rock for several days or more so one can work the moves. There are several empty bolt holes on CCC and I am very glad that all of the unnecessary bolts were removed. I do not detest the bolts in the aid roof, but I do not like to see draws hanging from it - the difference being how much more noticable one is compared to the other. I met one gentleman who was attempting to redpoint the roof and I told him "good work, certainly more than I could do without aiders".    If you want to ask any more personal questions, email me at the email I provided. That way we can keep unnecessary bullshit off this public site.

    Have you tried the route free? What do you think the odds are that any gear placed for a free ascent is going to stay there, eventually welded in place by climbers falling and hanging to work out the moves? By the way it's been a while but wasn't there a bolt next to a perfect crack on Country Club?
    Oct 23, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I could see your reasoning on the CCC and Athlete's Feat if there were bolts next to the perfect cracks on each climb with quick draws hanging from it. Two bolts and one visible anchor on each climb are not the eyesore that three brightly colored draws hanging on a roof are. In my original post, I was only pointing out the fact that the draws were very noticeable and it only takes a couple of complaints by non-climbers to close an area (bolt ban in the Flatirons for example). I was also pointing out that the roof takes great gear, whether placed on lead or on aid, and the bolts are not needed. I greatly respect the effort to free the roof, but do the means justify the end? Some climber really need to open their eyes to the impact, visually and audibly in some cases, to the other people who are enjoying the area, climber or non-climber.    I find it interesting that gear left on a route (besides fixed anchors) is considered booty unless it is on a sport climb. As easy as it is to clip a draw to a bolt, is it really necessary to leave the draws on the bolts? I realize the climb is hard, but clipping all the quick draws in place is not.

    That sucks that someone took your gear. Fortunately, even thought the two hangers were removed, the route accepts bomber gear through out the whole climb. Preplace it on aid if you can't place it while on lead.

    I tried this route on 10.19.02- worked all of the moves, had a great time, left my draws on it planning to return the next day to try and redpoint it.  When I came back in the afternoon of 10.20, I found not only my draws missing, but the first 2 bolt hangers removed.  The loser(s) who did this, left one of my slings looped through the third bolt hanger so they could get off.  Apparently who ever did this, aside from being a complete asshole, must have been a completely incompetent free climber since they left my quickdraw at the anchor which requires mandatory 5.9 hand crack climbing to reach.      Based on the evidence found at the scene, and composites developed through several witnesses, the suspect is a white male, 25-40 yrs, soft and pudgy with a pasty complexion.  He probably suffers from a lack of affection from his mother growing up.  Consequently, has never had an intimate relationship with a woman.  His only contact with the female sex is through the internet, magazines, or role playing video games.  Based on the way the route and my gear was treated, the suspect was probably abused as a child.  Suspects poorly developed sense of self-esteem, resulting in below average aptitude in sports, poor social skills

    A boulder problem, huh?  Interesting. The route goes free at 5.14 and when I solo-aided it, all the bolts had QDs on them (hope you finally worked it buddy). Don't kid yourself into thinking this is a first-timer aid route. I saw a party bail after the first bolt and then spend 20 minutes trying to rap off the bolt in high winds. Keep it low in your aiders. You can cheater-stick between bolts if you absolutely have to, but why?

    This climb is hard and awkward, at least the first 3 pitches. Yosemite-esque grading system. All anchors are bolted. All the cracks gobble up gear.    P1 - 2 clips, super tough mantel move. Not recommended right after a rain. Come to think of it, none of it should be climbed right after it rains. Maybe I should take my own advice... 11+.  P2 - Overhang crack/corner/lieback. Awkward. Hard. Throw a #4 in there, and blast up! 11-.  P3 - A slightly easier version of P2. 10d.  P4 - Fantastic. Good exposure on some jams. I beached whaled to get over the last bit. Super fun. 10c.  P5 - Sweet exposure. Watch out for that last flake, it's pretty hollow. There's definitely a death block waiting to be pulled out (it had an X on it when I climbed).    To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this climb. Everybody says it's super classic this, super classic that, but the pitches are really short and awkward. The only good pitches with cool exposure are 4-5. I'm sure many disagree with me, but hey, what are internet forums for anyway?    Descent: head north.

    Pssssshhh, fuck you, guys, that mantel move isn't 11a, and you know it. Cold conditions are mandatory for the opening moves (as with CCC) otherwise you're just senselessly flogging the tips. Come to think of it, cold conditions are useful for the rest of the climb as well. You can combine the first three pitches with a tagline to rap on for a really phenomenal lead and toprope after with some directionals, great and very physical training.

    Few routes deliver such sustained and varied climbing at the grade.  Pitch 4 was the easiest for me on account of I have reasonable balance, and pitch 1 was sorta easy (but my solution was very height-dependent).  Pitch 2 and 4 were just ass kickers - because I kinda suck at picking the right pro while pumped and reaching around a semi-blind corner!  Best skill for the send is gonna be efficient pro placement (and choice), 'cause the moves are sustained.  What a blast!

    I just stumbled across this thread and thought I would add a bit of amusing history.    I climbed Athlete's Feat in the fall of 1973; at the time it still had a bit of a reputation.  Years of mantling in Yosemite were helpful on the first pitch.  The second pitch was scream. There was an old "sucker" piton beat into the horizontal crack. The problem was that it was beat so far into the crack that it would not accept a carabiner - any carabiner. And I tried every style I had on the rack.  By the time I figured out what was going on, my arms were pretty flamed. I got some nut in and kept chugging to the belay. My partner was pretty amused. I remember that pro in the pre-cam era was a bit sketchy on the wide pitches.

    What a classic climb! I wish though I had read some of the comments before embarking with my wife. I figured a bit of 11a and then a fun  5.10. It took me about 10 times to get the crux move on p.1. If it wasn't for Bob D'Antonio and a group of his friends shouting beta, I would probably still be there trying various possibilities. On p.2, the move from the layback into to the crack was hardish (a fist jam above the chalked hold in the crack worked for me). The p.3 exit was very physical. My last piece was about half way down the crack. Scary. It may be helpful to bring no. 5 Camalot, just for the peace of mind. Now to pitch 4. This was the scariest, most insecure pitch I've climbed in a while. The gear is good (small up to 0.75), but the rock is polished and the moves are sketchy. For me too, this was the hardest pitch (not counting p.1), though it would be very hard to choose the hardest move. I suppose every move is 5.10a or something. Now to my question, how were pitches 3 and 4 protected before cams?

    From Pat Ament, writing on Supertopo:    There is a route on Boulder Canyon's Castle Rock called Athlete's Feat. The name was given by Robbins when he and I did the route all free (now rathed one pitch of 5.11 and four of 5.10, pretty stiff for 1964, no chalk, Spiders for shoes). Anyway the route had been mostly aided before but not named. The first pitch is an amazing, smooth, bulging wall. Robbins did a finger-tip undercling up and left, on vertical rock, with his fingers under a thin flake, then -- while holding with the right hand under the cling, reached up and right, above him, with his left hand, leaning backward, to get his left finger tips on a small hold at the upper lip of the bulge. The feet aren't on much. For protection he had only a scary-looking bugaboo piton hammered straight up under the thin flake. Below is a big spike of granite that might impale you if you fell. He pulls up on the left finger-tip hold and reaches above the bulge. There is mostly nothing up there but a steep smooth slab and a not-so-good hold to pinch for the right hand. To make a long story short, he does a wild, sloping mantel up onto that smooth, slanting surface, a really bold lead way above his pro, with a ground fall likely onto that spike probably if he failed. Years later I was strolling along the road, came around the corner, and saw a guy standing in aid on that section. He'd already placed a bolt and was drilling another one above that one, right where the master had carved with me such a beautiful Michelangelo of an ascent. I tried not to go crazy and simply said to the leader, "What are you doing?" He replied, "Puttng up a new route." I replied, "I hate to tell you, but that route goes all free. It has been led without protection." The answer came back to me, "Oh SURE it was, SURE it was done free." I realized I could do or say nothing, so walked away. A few days later the two climbers were spreading it all over town, "Ament was up at Castle Rock trying to tell everyone how to climb." Anyway, for a long time subsequent free climbers used those bolts for protection. I think the top bolt is still used, creating in essence a top-rope for the bold, crux move. Not many know what a brilliant lead that was back in the stone age...   Fred Flintstone

    Well, I have always wondered how solid that fixed Alien on P2 was.  As we climbed it today, I clipped it (and backed it up--I've never really liked it) and kept going.  It didn't appear to be any different than I remembered.  As my partner climbed up to it, the motion of the rope as he approached was enough to cause it to fall out of the crack.  Kind of scary.  I'm pretty sure I fell on this cam a few years ago, and I know I've seen others fall on it.  The cam is mutilated.  The cams don't even move anymore.

    Fun route, but be careful when plugging in cams just off the 2nd belay.  Apparently there were some loose flakes in there when I did it, and when I fell just after the bulge I pulled a solid-feeling #2 Camalot which extended the fall all the way back to the belay ledge.  My partner says he saw a bunch of rock fragments fly out when the cam blew.  I wasn't injured or anything, but it was the first piece of gear that I ever had pull out on me.

    Fun and in your face climbing. Most of the real cruxes are short, but to me the 10b and 5.9 pitches run togehter presented the most challenge. They are consistently insecure and seem harder than their respective grades, particularly finishing up 'direct' from the last set up chains, going up on a crack to the steep flake to the right.  This is one of the better routes at Castle.     After climbing this again in the cold, I think that the difficulty is very weather dependant. Cruisable in the right temps, close to impossible if too hot or cold.

[Check this out about P1! No bolts.] Climb to the top of the flake, place a piton to the left (above your head) [but below the slab!] for protection, and climb up and over a severe bulge to the bench....    The second lead is one of the most difficult 5th class pitches in the region...    The third lead (5.10) is the shortest (although it refuses to let the party rest). It was first led free in 1964 by Dave Rearick [same year as the FFA]. Layback up a severe, overhanging bong-bong crack [for you youngsters, bongs are big angle pitons], and make a difficult exit move....    The fourth lead does not ease off.

    After a humiliating day on (and much off) Athlete's Feat, it was reassuring to read some of the comments above about people getting _crushed_ by this route. If I had read the comments this morning, I would have gone back to bed. To complete the humiliation, as we topped out, we got hit by a lightning storm and pouring rain.    I first did this route with my brother Paul and Rich Perch (a long time Grand Tetons climbing ranger and now a ranger in Canyonlands) in 1975 during a short stopover in Boulder on the way to Yosemite. Although we didn't have to wear Kroenhopher's (spelling doesn't look right), neither did we have cams and fancy nuts. Basic stoppers and hexes. But there were probably some fixed pins.    The key hold on the P1 mantle probably hadn't broken yet. Don't remember much about P2 and P3. We may have taken a few falls, but we were young and foolish and may have just went for it without much gear. I do remember P4 and how surprisingly hard it was.    Today, after a few half-hearted efforts we aided P1. Highly recommended (to aid it). I got partly up using the technique Bill Wright mentions on 6/14/02, but didn't have the motivation, and perhaps not the strength, to follow through with the mantle. What seemed most promising to me was this, not mentioned above: There is a good crimp for your right hand on the _lip_ out right. Best hold on this pitch. Left hand to the big pinch, but use it as a layback. Now that you are to the right, there are no footholds. I leaned out and walked my feet up and then threw my left foot high onto the small but positive hold on the lip to the left. Started to pull onto the foot, but couldn't quite make it.    I won't say much about pitches 2-4, other than that 2 and 3 weren't pretty. Can we say we did _Upper Athlete's Feat_?    With rain threatening I started up the easy-looking P5 9 variation. Ran into trouble with some bird shit on the _ledge_. Not too bad, but psyched me out. Wasn't sure what to do here, and ended up hand traversing left to join up with the top of the 8 variation. The 9 variation apparently continues up the left curving crack. There are also some flakes angling a bit right that look climbable.

    CAUTION!!!  There is a wasp's nest about two-thirds of the way up pitch 4.  Three or four wasps started swarming around my partner as she led it.  She lowered quickly until they left her alone, and then went back and down-aided to get the gear out.  The nest is right in the crack and is unavoidable, but you can rappel off from the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd belay of this route, so you can still do the first few pitches.  It's probably best to just wait for the wasps to vacate in the fall.As for climbing it in summer, it can be done.  This time of year the first pitch gets sun at about 9 AM, and you better be done with it by then or it becomes virtually impossible.  The rest of the pitches aren't as bad on a hot day.All things considered, this is one of the better routes I've done in the canyon.  Royal sure knows how to pick 'em.

    It is very gratifying to hear such comments, as I recently returned to this route and got crushed. I couldn't do the first pitch crux for the life of me. Then I got hammered leading the second pitch and fell off the third pitch (following, thankfully). At that point the fourth pitch felt utterly desperate. My partner, who cruised everything put the crux move and eventually got that, called the 4th pitch the hardest on the route (not counting the crux move).     I think this route is a lot harder than CCC when taken in their entirety. They have similarly hard, crux starts and while CCC has a harder crack crux and a more sustained section of climbing, it doesn't have as many very hard sections as this route.    Back to the drawing board on this one for me...

    I just recently did this route got the mantle clean (on TR) for the first time. I not sure what "bucket hold" Steve is talking about, but this is how I did it. Undercling with the left hand as usual and obvious. I can then make a big reach (six feet tall) and get the crummy pinch over the roof with my right hand. Feet are very tricky at this point and you have to really pay attention so you don't slip off. Then I put my left hand on the tiny, painful crimp on the lip of the roof. I quickly switch this to mantle position and then get my left foot up on an edge BELOW the lip of the roof. Once there I press out the mantle and struggle to get my right foot over the lip.    I used to think this mantle move was harder than the Country Club Crack start, but now I think they are pretty similar in difficulty. Each one is very difficult and solid 5.11 (especially when compared to sport route ratings in this canyon) and each one involves a "trick". Tough, fun stuff.    Also, I led the third pitch with a single #3 Camalot. This might be a little bold, though I'm not known to do such things, but I think it is the easiest way to do this pitch. Lieback up to the foothold and get a jam. Place the #3 Camalot and get ready to gun for the top. Lieback the rest of the way until you can reach over the top and thankfully get a hand jam. Don't blow it up here, but if you do it this way the entire pitch will take about two minutes to lead.

I extended the first bolt with draws, and then it's reasonable to lead and a super fun route. What a gem! The upper crux pulls fine without gear after the bomber corner gear - spicy but a clean fall. Personally, I would way rather have the first bolt 8 ft. lower to avoid the decker. It doesn't need more bolts, but it's too bad they were kinda poorly placed, IMHO. Really a great line though!

    4 star movement and rock quality, if only a little short. 3 stars overall. Spectacular face climbing. This is intimidating to onsight but easy to redpoint after working out the moves and gear. Do not try to overprotect by placing gear in the jug slots. Instead, gun it for the horizontal crack and place a #6 BD stopper and a purple Metolius/blue Alien equivalent. The runout start is on fairly moderate climbing compared to the crux. Blowing at the crux could result in an unpleasant swing to the right.

    I took the fall just before the first bolt after probably 30+ ascents on lead. It's actually not all that bad of a fall with a soft landing...no more bolts please. Bring a crash pad if youre worried.
    Apr 22, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The route is R for sure. There is one good directional nut placement down low, although it would still be potentially a 30' ground-fall from the next moves getting to the bolt. They are maybe 10a moves but on small feet. Awesome movement.
    Jul 7, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route is definitely R rated if starting from the left ramp as opposed to directly beneath the first bolt.  If starting along the ramp, be prepared for a dicey unprotected move.  Cool route.
    Jun 23, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Fine route with sketchy start. Looked like there was a place for tiny nut, but I would have doubts falling on it. The move from which you can hit the ground is only about 5.9, so I don't know how appropriate R rating would be in context of the whole route. A yellow C3 perfectly protects traverse left at the top, so you don't have to swing into the corner if you blow it.

    Dan and I climbed this route a year or so before his transition to rap bolting sport routes. This route, in my mind, represents the vision and commitment Dan held as a climber. Not only was it a bold lead, he found this line on one of the more popular crags in the canyon. That is his gift - finding great lines.    I am glad to see others here defending this route in its original form. It would be a bummer to see bolts added to this route. Right after Dan and I climbed this route, a Spanish guy who was traveling through the area nailed the 2nd ascent and confirmed the rating.
    Apr 8, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a great route- techy, pumpy, and a bit spicy.  The PG-13 refers to the start, which is probably 10+.  There is an obvious, bomber, small cam to protect the move up to the rail, then a #1 Peanut to protect the move to the jug. The rest of the gear is bomber but pumpy to place for sure.  I called this 11c only, because IMHO it is much easier than Englishman's...might also be easier than CCC for many.  In any case, awesome route that the competent 5.11 leader should not shy away from.
    Sep 20, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    My buddy, Steve Annecone, figured out how to get two good pieces (a yellow/green offset Alien and an RP) before the first bolt.  The gear makes for a pretty damn safe lead and should only be considered S, at the worst.
    May 5, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route definitely does not need any bolts added.  It is perfect as it is!  It is an exciting lead but has probably been led hundreds of times if not much more.  Not every route has to be dumbed down with a bunch of bolts.  Leave some routes for those who like a little adventure and challenge.

    I couldn't find any gear worth putting in before the first bolt.  It's not much of an issue as the climbing up to that point is fairly easy.  This is an excellent and pumpy lead, well worth doing.  I don't know if I would say it's as hard as 11d though.
    Feb 25, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I thought it was a good route.  I don't remember any rp's to protect the start, though.  After clipping the first bolt the gear remains good.  Crux is pullin' on a crimper... way more straightforward, and basically easier, than the start of Country Club, the start of Athlete's Feat, and the beginning, slabby moves of Never a Dull Moment, all of which are rated one or two letter grades easier.

    The last comment says you can place #2s, but I had two and did not use either.  Small cams, a #3, and a #4 are what I used, and there are also good nuts. I did this climb in 1996, and it was fun to do it again in 2015. Makes me feel old....

    I didn't find this route worthy of more than 1 star. As some have mentioned, I found the 'crux' to be quite easy, almost no-hands.  I post the following for safety reasons.    1. The first 40' is very poorly protected until you get to the overhanging block in the corner. You can put some larger cams in, but the cracks are all flared.  They look pretty good at ground-height, but it's misleading. I would give this a PG rating.    2. Bring extra #2-#4 cams.  Leave the 0.75 and smaller on the ground.  There's a few good nut placements once you're in the corner but not where you want them.

    I thought this was a 4 star or 3 star route depending on the maximum amount of stars for a route.  Nice start with some  clean and fun crack climbing up to a big roof.  The would guess the  overhang can either be 5.8 grunting or some very tame 5.6/7 stemming.  Great climb.

    Where is it in relation to the new anchor?  I remember what it looked like, with the little, head-sized rock supporting it.

But if you say it is there, I believe you.    Thanks for the new anchor.

    Rodger,  If you look a few comments up, you will see I put in an anchor in Aug. 2009. Perhaps an admin should update the route description to reflect this. There is now a good (bolted) 2nd pitch called Beetle Bailey.

    Greg,    Thanks for replacing the mess of an anchor that was there.  Now, instead of grovelling to the top and doing the downclimb (because I refused to rap off of the old anchor), I can get back to the base quicker and get rolling on the next route.  I was always amazed that the old anchor didn't just fall of the cliff under its own weight.

    Climbed 5/31/09 with S. Costello...First pitch is excellent, probably the best moderate at Castle. The roof does need a big cam, but there are good placements below that would hold a fall. I did it left side in, with a left-foot backstep to a solid foothold, then pulled over on jugs. This is a fun and not terribly difficult move.    There IS quality climbing above the first pitch. We finished on a 40-50 foot left-facing 5.7 corner that looks kinda dirty and grassy but is actually fairly fun. The descent is made much easier if you can locate the big Douglas-fir with the rap chain.

    I just climbed this on 6/16/08. A very well protected lead. I left a new sling at the rusty piton halfway up. Didn't trust old runners. Didn't really trust the rusty piton either. But I used it anyways.

    We didn't like the looks of the cable/rap anchor, so we continued up to the top of the crag.  By heading up and left from the cable we got to a decent chimney with clean and solid rock in the back of it.  Easy climbing on that second pitch, but there aren't a lot of chimney pitches in Boulder Canyon, so it was a nice surprise.  (Perhaps this is the upper pitch of the West Face?)

    I found this route fun and well protected. The overhang moves at the top are easy once you see it.     I echo what is said above that the climbing after the first pitch is less than great and your options to rap are sketchy at best. Worth the hassel though, very fun movement.
    Sep 20, 2007

    My partner and I climbed this route a couple of weeks ago.  What a nice climb until you get to the top of the first pitch.  We took a good look at the cable slung boulder and decided against using it to rap.  We didn't want to trust our lives to what appears to be a completely detached boulder supported by a helmet sized chockstone.    We climbed to the top and downclimbed as for Cussin' Crack, Jackson's Wall, etc.  Once we found the correct trail, it wasn't too bad.      Any chance of relocating the cable?
    Sep 15, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is an excellent and sustained pitch.  For me, the crux is at the start: insecure flared cracks and slippery feet.  Above, sustained crack climbing leads to the roof. There is a bomber yellow Alien placement in a crack on the right, just before you make the final move over the roof.  Backstep with the left foot to the highest foothold, then stem the right foot on the lip of the roof, and it's over.  Done this way, the roof feels like 5.7.    I used doubles on  #1 and #2 Camalots, and didn't place anything bigger than a #3 Camalot.  A #4 Camalot will give you bomber pro below the roof, but I was happy with the yellow Alien a few moves higher.

    Watch out for the cable sling at the top of Bailey's Overhang.  The boulder is completely detached!  If someone large were to rap off that thing, it could pull.  It is way scary!

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree with Larry on this one.  The boulder at the top with the steel cable around it looks very very unsafe!!!  The boulder is completely detached and looks like it could go if you had someone big enough rappeling on it.  I'm not a big bolt person but for safety sake I think it would be a great idea if someone put in some bolts at the top of this route and removed the steel cable.  I'm certain it would look better than the cable and be much more safe!

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Great Route, I am a beginner 5.8 climber and found the moves very easy.  At the crux overhang, on the left is a solid ledge to stand on.  Once you have your feet on the ledge its easy to pull over the roof, the hands are big jugs above the roof (on the right side of the crack).  At the overhang I stuck in a #5 Friend that subsiquently walked to an open position as I turned the roof.  Perhaps a really big hex would have been better?  After that the climbing is very easy.  The rap anchor is a very scary looking boulder with a steel cable around it.  It looks completely detached?  I would use something else to rap next time. A very awesome route!  -Jason Shatek

    A 60m rope just makes it to the ground when rappelling from the steel cable that Paul mentions.
    Jul 20, 2004

    At the top of Bailey's Overhang (after the crux) you can bail over to the north and you find a steel cable wrapped around the top of a huge boulder.  One can rap from this down to the top of curving crack or maybe even to the ground with a long rope.  It looks like the only thing holding this boulder up there is a human head sized chockstone at the bottom of it.  It made me think twice about being attached to that boulder...maybe I am just paranoid...it is probably ok, but at some point it may rip loose...that would be very bad.

    You can protect this climb pretty well without wide gear, but with a 4.5 camalot, it looked like I could have had gear overhead almost anywhere.  I [did] the route "backwards" apparently, with my back to the left and feet to the right and it still felt like 5.8, so I think either way is do-able.The route seemed like a 2-star route, and maybe 3-star if you keep going and 'finish' on P2 of Coffin Crack (5.10 handcrack-to-fistcrack through a roof)
    May 19, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    At the crux, stay close in the crack, and face the opposite block. I used a small seam hold high and placed right foot on solid, high placement, and stepped up on it.  Chalk on the foot placement is a dead giveaway. But you must step up high. A bit awkward and good exposed at this crux.  I was too far right when I did this last year, no foot placement there. Hug the crack and look to place that right foot about knee height. This is a pretty cool little corner to turn.
    Aug 9, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree that the "crux" isn't particularly strenuous- in fact I strained more on the first few moves off the ground.  Just squeeze it a little and recall the womb. :) It also looked to me like a good call to skip the upper pitches, so we did- there is now a beefy fixed cable with a rap link just above and left of the end of the first pitch on the left side of a large ledge- can easily reach the ground from there with a 60m, and of course the anchor above curving crack.  Enjoy.
    Jun 2, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I love this route also. The overhang is NOT strenuous. It's almost no hands if you do it as a chimney. Back to the right, feet on the left on good holds. Move up and out. Turn around at the top. A couple big cams are useful but not necessary as another poster mentioned. Last time I did it (Spring 2001) there were slings up and left from the top of the first pitch. These did not look permanent.    Ivan Rezucha
    Sep 5, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Ditto for sure on this one. The key to the crux is getting that right foot in a small oblong pocket.  I was gripped a bit until I found that baby.  A sweet 5.8 do the rappel to chains above Curving Crack.  4 slings and ring are permanent now.

    Some fun climbing on a nice slab of rock.  Strangely bolted -- typical Boulder Canyon always-on-toprope style for the middle section, with a random runout or two at the start and finish.    My 60m rope didn't get me all the way back to the anchor on Bailey's overhang.  I came up about 5' short.  I ended up on a ledge that I was comfortable down-soloing the very easy, and not exposed moves to the anchor, but be careful.  Strangely, all 60s are not the same length.  Don't assume yours will reach.

    Nice route.  It adds some spice to Bailey's Overhang for the upper section.  You can either rap from the anchors (2 raps to ground with one 60-m rope) or climb to the top of the formation and scramble down.  This second option makes for a nice summit.  Some may think Beetle Bailey is over-bolted, but the clips are well placed and the climbing is clean.  I give it a 5.10b/c.

    Just looked in Rossiter's 1999 guidebook.  I think we climbed the route as he describes it.  D'Antonio's vague description may not disagree with Rossiter's.  I interpret Bubb's and Lefkoff's path as going up the obvious crack above the right-hand tree, which is to the right of the way we went -- at least (maybe) until the hand/fist crack through the overhang/bulge near the top.

    Today, I led the 5.7 first pitch just right of the wide crack, then belayed at the right-hand tree. Then I led leftish up the middle of a short, blank face; made an unprotected step left; moved up a short, shallow crack; then hand-traversed to the right along the upper horizontal (heavily lichened and exciting, 5.9+).  Then I climbed straight up a hand/fist crack through a overhang/bulge (5.9+) and up the right side of the pinnacle's summit block. If you instead do the handcrack, flare, gully, etc., straight up from the right-hand tree to the bulge crack, you will miss most of the best action.

    Awkward climbing after the horizontal crack. It turns into what feels like sport climbing, and although none of the moves are difficult, it can be a little tricky on the first go. Just like any route, once you figure out the beta it's a lot easier.

</strong></blockquote><blockquote>
    All the moves on this route are 5.9 at the hardest. However I'll admit that on an onsight attempt, it feels much more like solid 5.10, simply because the beta is somewhat difficult to figure out and the steepness of the route starts the pump clock and doesn't let up until the chains. So by the time you figure out the beta, you're way pumped and the jugs up top (and they ARE jugs) feel more like sloping crimpers.

    Sweet route in its current state.  Somewhat slick like all of lower Castle Rock so make sure it's cool.

    I replaced the broken pin today.  The old one had seen plenty of falls, and I wanted to get it out before the other eye cracked.  There is a new angle in the same place.  It's bomber, so fall away!      When I took the pin out, I did evaluate whether it could just become a placement for clean gear.  Without getting into the details, it is not a viable spot for anything but a pin, so I put a pin back in.    A local climber (not me) has put a ton of work into cleaning up this area.  He cleaned out all the broken glass he could get, and spread wood chips.  This is a vast improvement, and makes a nice spot to hang out.

    A good climb, my first 5.9 gear lead.  The pin is partly broken, not sure how many more falls its gonna hold.  I was able to get a gray alien in to protect the crux.  Watch out for the sharp edge that you pull over.  Once you finish the climb better to pull the rope through your gear to avoid unnecessary wear on your rope.  Cleaning will be harder but, I managed to do it so you can too.
    Apr 29, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Definitely a 5.9+ move in there getting from the fist crack to the left-leaning crack and slab!  Different ways to do it - without giving it away straight in jamming not necessarily the best option.    Also, fixed nut between this and the pin when I did it (seems really solid), but the eye of the pin is cracked.  Can protect above it with a number 1 Camalot (or even higher with a 0.75 which I had to do as I looked at the #1 on the ground).  Would recommend due to the fact that if the pin cracks through and the fixed nut pulls when your rocking right on the final moves you could conceivably ground out.

    Black Crack's 5.9 rating might be a relic from the past when it was shorter, instead of grade inflation.  Anchor locations have changed since the seventies.  Guidebook authors don't seem to have noticed.  Black Crack used to end at a bolt, just before the crux head-scum.  An empty hole is still visible.     Steeper and harder than the last pitch of Outer Space on the Bastille.

    Pretty stiff for a 5.9.  I found the Yellow Spur and the first pitch of Tagger to be much easier than this.  Though I agree that none of the moves are harder than 5.9, it threw me off because it was overhanging, and I wore myself out trying to get on to the face from the top of Gill Crack.  The pin is good.  I took a whipper on it while trying to get over the little corner at the top there.

    This route only has one star, but I think it deserves a higher rating. The crux for me was pulling out of the first crack and onto the face, before pulling over to the chains. Just look out left on the slab/face, because there are some feet, and rock on over to a good stance under the pin. I'd suggest slinging the pin too, as the eyehole definitely appears cracked. Every bit as fun as Curving Crack.  JGH

    Perhaps I am being picky, but if my memory serves me correctly, Skip led this route in 1982 not 1983. I guess I will have to dig up my old "Climbing" magazines in my storage &amp; see if this info exists. As for the climb, it feels like .12a on a top rope. I have not led it.

    (I'm the AC above...forgot to entire my name.)    Glad to hear the agreement re: Close To The Edge...it certainly felt like hard 12 to me...heck, it may as well have been 5.14. :-) If I remember correctly, the best hold on the route sits near the 2nd bolt, and the 3rd definitely seems like it would be the harder clip of the two...of course, I didn't lead it so... Also, the only fixed gear in Boot Lead now (again, if memory serves) is a fairly abused, small hex, well above the first (and harder) crux. Still, I'm sure its a welcome clip once there, for those bold enough to lead this route.

    Close To The Edge, the bolted line immediately to the left of this route, is rated a mere letter grade harder (12 a/b), but...in my humble opinion...is a whole 'nuther ball o' wax. I was able to toprope, sans falls (baaaarely), Boot Lead, but was completely shut down on Close To The Edge. Moving off the good feet into the blank section seemed essentially free from the burdens of any hand holds whatsoever...Very, very balancy stuff, both of these climbs, but at least Boot Lead has a hold or two here and there!    I enjoyed TRing Boot Lead very much - the lead would be thrilling enough to watch. I can't imagine the lead myself, with the undercling clogged with an alien.    Wear your stickiest rubber, and don't do it on a hot day... (I wonder if Skip did it barefoot ?!? ;-)

    First freed on lead by Skip Guerin and Chip Ruckgaber.  There actually is a TCU placement to "protect" the crux, but it takes up a good undercling hold and makes the move a bit harder.  Also, the story I've heard is when first led a hammer was used to fix gear (a pin and a head) that has since been removed.  It would be easy enough to ask Chip if this is true.  A better top rope.

    I am by no means an experienced OW climber but didn't think this was too bad. My slim 5'6" 130 lb frame probably helped. Protected the initial entry moves with a #1 above the bolt and went right side in. Once you're in it, use pretty straitforward squeeze chimney technique with a handful of good holds to ease the difficulty. The big key for me was to turn around so my left side is in and rerack on my right side at the second little bulge. Got creative with switching gear from left side to right side. Rack (c4s): 0.5, 1, 2x 2, 4, 5, 6, 2 slings for the top, 1 quickdraw - felt very safe. Tie your knot long for maximum squeezing!

    This crack was a gruntfest, I severely underestimated it.  If you're a masochistic 5.9/5.10 offwidth climber, you'll love this thing.     Establishing yourself into the chimney is the crux of this pitch, but made easier by facing right side in with a slammer hand jam, eventually turning left side in for most of the remainder of the climb (best to take off your helmet or it will get stuck, and obviously hang your gear OUT OF THE WAY OF YOUR ASS). Not going to lie, this route spanked me. Struggled at the crux, groveled up the chimney, made a mistake not to wear knee pads, and walked away with my tail between my legs. I'll be back for a redpoint after my knees, elbows, and ego are healed.     I placed a #.3 above the bolt, a #4 low, two #5s, #6,  #4.5, #4, and a #2. The gear is all straightforward, but make sure you have good offwidth technique - I thought I did, but this route was a serious reality check.

    Did this as a long-anticipated and really fun onsight yesterday. This is one of the best and steepest offwidths/squeeze chimneys I have done in the Boulder area. A few things to note to make your climb more enjoyable: getting into the crack wasn't bad with 6' height and +1 ape, but my slightly shorter friends found the moves into the initial jams quite challenging. Right side in felt like the way to go for the 1st two bulges, but I could see going left side in if you wanted to skip all of the good edges inside the crack. I highly recommend not wearing a shoulder sling due to the amount of full-immersion tunneling involved. The crux for me was moving the 5 and 6 the %@$# out of the way so I could make upward progress. I would recommend singles from fingers to 5 or 6 for this route, depending on how comfortable you are running it out on 5.8 #6 offwidth. Rack everything on the left hip for the first 2/3 of the route, then either continue right side in or re-rack on the right hip to do the last bulge left side in.

    This thing is brutal! Tried to lead it yesterday and was thouroughly humbled. I lobbed out onto the bolt at first (which I used a 48" sling on, oops!), pinching my junk between my harness and my leg. I was at the point where you get the first good jamb, but I couldn't get it set well enough to get pro in, pretty good distance. I was in great pain at that point so I came down. I went back up and got to the same point, threw in a crap #1 sloppily and hung, then placed a green/yellow hybrid and replaced the #1 with a truck #2. I then proceeded to lob out about 3 more times as I worked above the cam.    I came down again as I was in great pain, my friend todd went up next.  He lobbed out at least 3 times trying to get up past the roof only to admit defeat (he's been onsighting 11+ sport lately and working 12s on TR, generaly climbing 10-11 trad). We had another member to our team, so he went up to give it a try, suffering the same fate, lobbing out probly 3 or 4 times. I gave it another go lobbing out 2 more times, finally giving up and cleaning the gear.    For those of you like us who have to bail, I recommend setting a knot chock flicker knot in the juggy flake below the bolt, then you can un-clip the bolt and lower to the ground off the knot.  I cliped some cord and extra runners into the loop above the knot to assist in retrieving it.

    Traversing left to the anchor on Coffin Crack avoids a final bulge that is worth climbing.  It is a few more OW moves over this bulge (a #5 C4 protected it well), and was a good finish to the route.  A TR anchor can be built in the crack with gear in the 1"-3" range.  It does add a bit of hassle when you are ready to clean the anchor, but the Coffin Crack anchor is only about 6' away.  You can swing over to the CC anchor, rethread your rope through that, and then "lead" back out to get the gear anchor from By Gully.    As others have said, this route took me a few tries to lead, but taught me a lot about OW along the way.  Highly recommended.      Regarding Left or Right side in--I've tried both and found Left side in to be a little easier, but the difference is minor.      A bolt has been added to the sling anchor at the top of Coffin Crack, so it's a much better rap station now.

    A single set from #1 to #6 C4, with possibly two #4s, will protect this route nicely.  Took me several attempts to get a redpoint on this one, but I learned a lot about offwidth climbing in the process.  Yeah, it's a bit harder than a 5.10 OW, that's why it's rated 5.9+!
    Jul 29, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I thought this thing was way harder than Coffin Crack.  We actually warmed up on the other one, and although I probably looked as equally pathetic on both routes, this one gave me relatively less grief.  The moves from the face into the OW were the business to me. Next step, red point!
    Oct 8, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Those "5.9+" moves to get into the darn thing sure felt hard to me. I thought it was harder than Coffin Crack, to the left, which gets 10b. I did do this climb left-side in. Above comment suggests that's wrong, but it seemed best to me- maybe it wasn't right?  Also, I placed my #4 Camalot low (left of the bolt) and ended up runout above.
    Jun 5, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The first time I tried this was left side in and I got 'thrashed'. The second time up a fist jam after the bolt allowed me to stuff my right shoulder in and after a bit of sissy kicking the rest of the route was dispatched with a minimal donation of epidermal tissue. Two stars for sure.

    Good technique goes a long way on this one, so lack of technique will earn you a thrashing.  One reality about seconding this is that if you slide out of the slot you can't get back in and have to be lowered to the ground.  This climb belongs in Yosemite, or is at least good training for nasty Yosemite wide cracks.

    Curious where people think the 5.9, let alone 5.9+, part is. The chimney? I found the chimney to be full of features and ledges for feet. It seemed like a typical Vedauwoo 5.7 for this part, and I expected the top to be harder, but instead found it to be quite tame. To clarify, I'm not trying to say anything about the Vedauwoo vs. BoCan grades, just that the Voo has quite a few granite squeeze chimneys to compare it to.
    May 25, 2015

    For maximum value, clip the bolt (it was a rusty spinner but replaced in recent years) and climb into the thin crack without climbing the chimney to the left.  5.9 plus, hmm, about 10 letter grades....
    Oct 5, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    You can get good stoppers up to about a #8 outside of the chimney on the left. A very small RP comes first, but after that it's not "small."  The route can also be made more interesting by forcing it left and continuing rather than going up to the anchors on Tongo. After finishing the wide part, step up and left to a roof with a crack horizontal behind it- place a .75" cam and step over the roof, then slightly left again to join the face above. Continue upwards to 2 very thin parallel cracks  with some rock jammed between. Place a very large stopper, then a small one (#5 BD) then step up and pull up and left over to the ramp of Jackson's Wall.  Be careful of these "trapped" stones- the top one, about the size of your head, is somewhat loose.    Belay on good gear and continue as for Cussin' Crack.  Cussin' can be made more interesting by climbing the hand and fist crack through the roof 1/2 way up. (5.9+?)
    May 17, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Adventurous little doo-hah. With much effort, I got 2 or 3 good RPs in a row in the flake exiting the chimney.  A solid #7 stopper below backs up the whole mess.  kind of fun moves for the first 30 feet, and then wander your way up on jugs and traverse to the Tongo second anchors.  I don't think this one gets climbed much.    You don't need anything bigger than a .75 Camalot for the route.
    Aug 29, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There is about 40' of easy (5.0) traversing without tons of pro to get over to the Tongo anchors once done with the crux, so make sure the 2nd is down with that.  Also as a leader you can't see the anchors until you are right at them, or from the ground, so check the topo showing where the anchors are carefully. I thought it was a fun route, solid rock and unusual climbing!

The second pitch of this route is really fun and cool. If you beat the first pitch, keep going up for a second battle at the handcrack through the roof (5.10).

    Was up here on Thursday and again today, and there is a rope fixed. If this is yours, please retrieve it.    NOW, some fixed line etiquette - on Thursday, part of the line was hanging (appeared to be fixed) from the top anchor, and the latter half was fixed on the lower anchor. I hiked around and threw my line off the top to run a toprope solo. The apparently "fixed" rope was held by a stopper knot which would have easily passed through the rings if someone weighted it from below. I was shocked and slipped that part of the line through, tossing it to the ground. So, the rope is still fixed at the bottom anchor, and I coiled the remainder behind the boulder at the bottom. For whoever's rope this is, please know that leaving a rope in such a precarious state is a big and dangerous disservice. While it's questionable to leave a rope hanging by the road in BoCan at all, leaving a rope fixed to the top of such a popular climb with nothing but a stopper knot is just unfair to the climbing community. Ropes that appear fixed should be fixed, period. Maybe it was late, maybe it was dark and you forgot to untie the stopper not. I don't know, but then please get back up there and clean up after yourself. I was there again today, Sunday, and the rope is still there, still fixed on the lower anchor, waiting for a retrieval.

    I didn't climb this route before the blocks fell out of the roof, but on my first climb of this, I felt that the roof on pitch two was almost as hard as the crux on pitch one (granted, in a very different style).    I'd suggest 11b for the roof moves on pitch 2 now.    If you're not comfortable pulling those moves with a #0.3 Camalot below your feet (assuming you extend it from its placement at the back of the roof), you would probably need to bring a #5 Camalot to protect the roof pod now.

    Indeed, the chockstone under the roof is no more. This deserves a mention on such a historical and classic line.     While not a huge deal, my guess is that people will find pulling the roof a touch harder now.

    The blocks under the roof are gone now                        Pulling the funny move above the roof.      . Apparently they were suddenly quite loose, and someone cleaned them out a few weeks ago.     The blocks provided a few jugs that made getting around the roof pretty straightforward. I wouldn't say it's harder now, but it is a little less straightforward. For what it's worth, I'm 6'5" and could see how it might be harder for short people now.    The resulting pod under the roof is a little tricky to protect. There is a pinch that would take a #0.75 Camalot (or probably better, a black Metolius), but if it walks at all, it will be useless quickly. I found a good yellow Alien on the right side of the dihedral, under the roof, in the crack that heads right to become Nobody's Home.

FYI- There is now a fixed red TCU top of the 2nd pitch crux. It walked to far back and over cammed too much to get out. It's in a great spot though just before the thank god jug. Clip it and keep moving. :) :)

    A 70m rope makes it in one pitch with about 25ft of rope left. Doing it in one pitch I used my whole rack, which was triples of everything Camalot 0.5 - 3 and a few smaller cams. Amazing pitch!

    I know a lot of people would frown on this but, this climb is a great place to practice aid climbing (clean of course), along with the aid roof a little farther west on Castle Rock. If you're rusty and headed for a big wall or trying to learn, taking laps on this is great fun.    Side note: Try to climb this when it is not conducive to free climbing, i.e. cold, night, early am, winter or the like. Be mindful, if aid climbing, that this is a very popular and quality free line and chocking it up for hours aiding would be less than polite.

    My ONLY complaint with this route is that the first (and only) bolt is in such an awkward position--ok, maybe not so awkward if you're 5'7" or more, but let me tell you, when you're 5'4", it's a SCARY first bolt...  Otherwise, ditto on all raves above.

    Can be done in one pitch and what a great pitch, but it leaves the second in a scary situation for the opening face moves due to rope stretch.  And nobody should miss out on that awesome face climbing.

    A 60m rope will not reach the anchor on P1 of Athlete's Feat! I was about 5 feet short, dangling in the air. I could not find a placement for the #4 even though I brought it. I had a #3 above the roof, but one or two #2s would have been enough.

    I think the first bolt holds the crux. The next move felt much easier for me. That added bolt was ridiculous!    The middle part of this climb is some of the best moderate, crack climbing in the canyon!
    May 27, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Someone added a new bolt between the second bolt and the crack. This bolt was not needed for a safe free or aid ascent. We promptly removed the bolt and the hanger. It is a self drilling bolt and the sleeve is still in the rock. If any one knows how to remove the sleeve WITHOUT damaging the rock further, email me or someone to do so. Epoxy and a little rock dust should minimize what is already a swiss cheese rock.

    I found the only real rest on the second pitch came after the roof, where I was able to slide my whole right leg into the wide crack, flexed and torqued until solid and I was able to hang quite comfortably sans meathooks (what my arms felt like after the roof).  I wouldn't call it a "knee lock", more of an off width jam.  I got it all back but it didn't really matter a hoot, the last 15' still kicked my ass.

    It too finally got on this climb this weekend.  All I can say is "tough climb" and that I will be sore for days.  I agree with that above comments that you can do without the #4, no reason to lug that thing up there.  I'm hoping to figure out some sort of rest in the section of wide crack just past the roof (knee lock???), otherwise I have know idea how I could do it continuously, way to pumped for the thin fingers, difficult feet section (the real crux of the route to me).

    After 3 or 4 trips up to Castle Rock in the last year, I was finally able to get on this route... no aid climbers this morning!  The face climbing at the start is desperate, though possibly slightly easier than the Athlete's Feet mantle... I'm not sure how shorter people are able to do the move past the 2nd bolt.  The crack pitch is pumpy, though look for a tricky no-hands rest on the upper part.  From the anchors at the top you can TR the excellent Englishman's Home (11c- very thin looking gear) which takes the Athlete's Feet start straight up through a series of lieback corners to the flake system left of CCC, joining that route at the roof.
    Aug 20, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I found that the best way to protect the second is to clip a 0.75 cam up and left of the belay or a red/yellow Alien just left of the belay to minimize the pendulum (the traversing face moves at the end are the scariest moves on the whole climb). You don't need anything larger than a #3 cam although there are places to put big pieces. Not many nut placements, but there are a few that are completely bomber. There are also a few hex placements that are definitely more bomber than the cams that would go in their place. When I do it as one pitch: set of stoppers, few hexes, 2 x red Aliens, 2 x yellow Aliens, 2 x (#0.75, 1, 2, 3) Camalots, plenty of draws for the pins/nuts/hexes, and a double length to equalize the bolts with a runner to reduce drag. This is a good training route as most of the falls are safe (except the start - safe at A0) and (if you are proficient at placing good pro) all the gear is bomber.

    What a fun/scary lead.  Scary - because I lack ability, strength, etc.  Fun - because the route takes pro so well.    The original comment on the route says to take a #4 Camalot.  Somone else said you only need a #2 and smaller.  I found a #3 Camalot protected the roof, and then right after you move left from the roof, and #2 Camalot helped calm my mind.  As the crack gets thin, the green, yellow, and red Alien were perfect.  Better leaders probably wouldn't see the need to place all three pieces throughout this thin section.  Once you get to the top of the crack, the route moves right.  Before moving up and right, I placed a #1 Camalot as a passive piece to protect the second from a pendulum after he cleaned the Aliens at the fingers crux.    Hopefully, this will help others in deciding what pro to take.
    Aug 19, 2002

    I found it more enjoyable to climb as one pitch, however, it's easier for the second to impale their backside on a fall from  the opening moves due to the rope stretch.  The thin section at the top is much easier without tape.

It is not everyday that you can climb a route mentioned in both Pat  Ament  and Royal Robbins' biography.    The 5.11 finger/off hand crack (crux second pitch) is a humbling experience...

    I love this route. I've done it nine times and still no redpoint of the upper pitch. Only once have I had another party on the route at the same time. If you want this route to yourself get on it early on a weekday morning. Of the nine times I've done this route, six of them were before work. This is the time to climb it anyway since you want the first pitch cool and in the shade.    Others should definitely share the rock, but I think topropers and (clean) aid climbers have a right to climb this route as well. Heck, the Salathe Wall on El Cap is a free climb. Should all aid climbers be barred from climbing it? Common courtesy should be exercised by all involved. Maybe the aid climbers can offer to let the free climbers by after the first pitch?

    RE/raps: a 60m will get you to the bolt anchor atop P1, and the leader can even lower down and belay the second from here, if desired (this will require exciting swinging shenanigans for both the leader and the follower).

    A few thoughts. 1) You can get by with, at most, one #2 Camalot and nothing larger.  I find this route protects well with plenty of Camalots between 0.5 and #1, some screamers for the pins and a few (very few) nuts and aliens.    2) Share the rock! I've seen many people tie up the route for half a day or more while pracicing aid.  If must practice aid here, try going on off hours.    3) You can rap the route with one rope by swinging over to the anchors atop the second pitch of Athlete's feet.    Tom Isaacson

    Led this today, great and safe 5.9   I would definitely recommend this as there is plenty of gear to be placed making falling safe.  I don't think this route is slick due to high traffic but rather due to the rock - actually adding to the character of this climb, it makes you think, starting with bigger jams, going to smearing with your feet and using the two walls of the dihedral.  Climb this.

    Seemed same difficulty as Dmentia over on Happy Hour to me, so I said 10a, as that is what Dementia is thought to be. Rating might be influenced by doing the right exit at the roof, instead of left, and it continues to be hard there. Chains/bolts for anchor seemed fine. Excellent pitch, and definitely easier than Skunk Crack (less greasy).

    Good line but very stiff for the grade even seconding, as feet tend to slip off.  More like 5.10a (UK E1 5b) it seemed to me, but I guess the 5.9 grade is "traditional".

    What?  This is great 5.9 maybe 5.9+ climbing on very solid rock.  The pro is great and as I recall, bomber.  Its not friction-granite (but little is at Castle), so may feel a bit slick.  There are 2 pretty damn good rest positions/gear placing if you stem out with your left foot.  As you can belay from your car there is zero approach.  The climb is short but sweet. 2+ stars (3 if it was longer).

    Did this route two weeks ago. My first 5.9 trad lead.  I can sauce a 5.8+ but this thing was very tough for me.  The protection wasn't super good but certainly adequate.  The first section is a piece of cake, it gets interesting after the piton.  The rock on this route is very slick and the foot holds suck!  I wouldn't recommend this route for new 5.9 leaders!  It felt like I was on my hands a lot with no real rests.  Because of the approach I give it one star.  Also, I believe the hangers at the top are on small bolts which aren't recommended for use anymore and one of them is loose.

    Man, I was up there with my kids in the creek the other day and these guys were eyeing up curving crack..... i told them it's awesome and they decided to do it.  The guy hung at the hand crack, hung on the stemming in many places and fell off the roof a couple times....then he almost made it over the roof but fell and pulled a yellow alien and a blue alien and fell probably 40 feet upside down and was saved by the fixed pin.Man, it was fuckin' scary fall but he was ok with a helmet on too.  Make sure you get a good placement in that upper chalked up crack (easy to do) and extend it cuz turning the roof pulls that cam around a bit and probably walked it enuff to cause it to pull on that guy...... careful out there but climb hard.

    As of today, the rappel tree still had a piece of webbing and a leaver-to-Beaver biner that was taped shut. Thanks! Also, the bolt on the first pitch is pretty new and definitely worth clipping. Finally, just as you finish the cussin' part of the second pitch (the V-slot with kneebars) and you reach a nice sitting ledge, there is a piece of old rope hanging down there. It looks like it got stuck in the crack above. Not good as your belay anchor in case you are tempted to stop there. Best option would be to continue climbing past it and up the sort of chimney slot above until you top out on easier rock. First time back on this route since about 1976 or so. Seems more polished.

    We did the descent off of Castle Rock this past Saturday with no problems. The tree that used to sport chains now has some new webbing with a leaver carabiner.

    Ok, the descent used to be head north to a tree with chains and webbing for a rap. Got there today, and the tree had no chains or webbing on it.

    Let me take a moment to add to the BS about this route:     P1: instead of climbing the chimney or face immediately right of the chimney, climb directly below the overhang to the right of the chimney. Good holds and protection can be had this way. Small cams and/or nuts. A few moves lead to the last portion of the chimney from where a ledge will be reached. Don't clip that bolt... instead place a small cam to its right, and pull the moves onto the belay ledge. 90' 5.7    P2: don't bother moving the belay unless you really need to see your second. Instead, move west about 15 feet, and climb over easy terrain that leads to a ledge below the v-slot. The v-slot is very fun and easily protected without large cams. This leads to a perfect belay ledge. 100' 5.7 (really?)    P3: climb up a weird chimney and belay, 50', 5.7.    P4: easy terrain up to the summit, 5.2, 75'.    Fun climbing, great position and a beautiful summit.

    I am ALSO a 5'3" woman, and it was very challenging to get past the bolt. After a few minutes of checking it out, I did the exact same thing. Went up right and traversed left.

    Ok, so if you 5'3", as I am, leading the move past the bolt is quite challenging!  After reading other people's comments, I realized as soon as I got there I wouldn't be able to go up just to the right of the bolt.  I ended up going up fartther right, up a slot with a broken piton.  It was awkward, but doable.  Then had to traverse back left above the bolt,  which was a little scary and exposed but actually not terribly hard.  Has anybody else gone this way?

    Not a lot of fun. The pitch up the V-slot is the only pitch worth doing (and perhaps the first 15 feet of the first pitch if you take the semi-unprotected direct start). The V-slot makes you sweat and think, but before long you are out of it and topping out on boring terrain. The first pitch is too ledgy; basically a series of easy bouldering problems. I don't know if my fears of decking were legitimate, but they were always in the back of my mind.

    I don't understand why this route is considered classic on so many lists.

Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad line, I just don't think it deserves classic status.  It doesn't feel very continuous with all the ledges and boulders, and even the second pitch you get tons of stem rests if you wanted them.  Get on it and decide for yourself.

    A Boulder Canyon classic and a good introduction to wide crack climbing.    Here's how I like to do the climb:    p1. 5.7, 80'.  Climb the  face right of the chimney.  You can get in a nut and a small Alien down low, but you are soon in groundfall territory.  The climbing isn't too hard (5.5), so stay with it until you can get in a good big cam below a chockstone at the top of the face.  Continue up and traverse straight  left to a ledge with an old bolt.  You can back up the bolt with nuts and small cams.    The move past the bolt can be done two ways.  For me, the easiest is high right: climb up right of the bolt, step left onto a sloping ramp, and pull across onto your left foot.  At 6'1", this felt about 5.6.  The other way is low left: Continue left past the bolt, then crank straight up.  This seems a lot harder.  Belay on a big ledge just above this move.    p2.  5.7, 70'. Move the belay to a higher ledge at the start of the V-slot. Climb the V-slot using knee-foot bars with the right leg (a kneepad on right knee is very helpful).  Press down with the right palm and hop the left foot up the crack.  Repeat several times and you're through the crux.  The V-slot can be protected with small-to-medium cams and nuts; no need for a #4 Camalot.  Belay on a good ledge at the top of the V-slot.    p3.  5.7, 90'.  More fun climbing on this pitch.  Continue up to a corner and roof, pass it on the left, and cruise up to a good ledge about 30' below the summit.  Belay here.  Bring your partner up then unrope and scramble to the top.    The descent is devious; pay careful attention to find the easiest way.  From the top, head a little left and downclimb past a series of ledges, eventually reaching a tree with a chain and slings.  You can rappel from here or continue left to a short steep downclimb that is easier than it looks.  More moderate downclimbing leads to the trail.

    We climbed this yesterday (8-23-03) and thought it was a great climb. I lead the first pitch (via slab start) but instead of traversing up the ramp then back left to the mank bolt (which I guess is the 'official' route) I stepped across onto the face at the top of the slab and went straight up. Anyone know the name/rating of this variation? 5.7 maybe? I thought it made the lower portion of the climb much more interesting and way more challenging. The gear was OK, although stepping across and making the first move onto the face kind of scared the piss out of me (potential for an ugly fall).

    The crux for me was the traverse on the first pitch.  I stand at 5'6" and could not reach any holds and not a lot for the feet either. Found this to be frustrating.  Any advice would help??  My friend Tim Feaver is much taller and the move was much easier for him.  The second pitch is all about the grunt factor and doing whatever it takes as long as you are moving forward but really does protect well so go crazy.  Getting off the top is not all that bad even though it was in the dark and no prior experience.

    I recommend the boulder start.  It was more fun than being in the chimney.  I got two psychological nuts in the piton scar before making what turned out to be very easy slab moves to a comfortable shelf on the boulder.  The crux to me was the tricky moves at the end of pitch one.  On the traverse left, go up to the left of the bolt.  Being 5 ft 7 in, I could just reach the handhold.  I yarded on it with no feet and found a nice crack above.  I threw a left heel up and was over.  I think this is could be quite easy for a tall person, but it was a 5.8 to me.  The move is all arms, almost no feet and not good protection.  My partner, who is 5 ft 6 in, could not reach the hold and resorted to yarding on a sling I had left dangling down for her to yard on.  We enjoyed the rest of the route.  The v-slot is secure and protected.
    May 23, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Rossiter calls this a real classic, and I agree.  I made the traverse left into a very short 2nd pitch.  I clipped the manky hanger, then cranked up on the parallel cracks to the right of this hanger using the piton scarred pockets with the left hand and a decent seam on top that I got the end of my finger tips in with the right. I believe this move/variation to be 8+ as there are no feet until you commit by pulling up and yarding the left foot up high onto a small bowl. My shorter partner could not reach the high seam and went left of the hanger. The V slot is smooth and awkward but no harder than 7. Fun route!

There's one section that is kindasorta exposed as you  go down a slabby ramp section and then a single  interesting downclimb that I would call 5.0 if it were any  longer than 25 feet, but as is I call it fourth class.  I've  gone up and down it numrous times, and am in no way  a superman trad climber who can do that kind of stuff  with his eyes shut.  The steep section has giant hand  holds galore, and ledges, too.  If you like you can find  yourself a cave to crawl through or go over the giant  boulder using the water hole on top as a ladder rung.   Let me ask, if it were a ladder would you be more  willing to downclimb it?  Personally I think yes, and this  is as easy if not easier than a ladder.  You can smear!   Oh, and the V-Slot is almost fourth class, if it weren't for  the fall potential and the chimney and/or slab.  The  slippery section on the second pitch is the only thing  that makes it 5.7, and I'd personally still call it 5.6.  Like I  said, I'm no superman trad climber.  I've soloed cussin'  crack, and only because I'm scared of gear, and gear  just seemed to be a waste of time on this.  Anyhoo,  climb on!

    Odd route, isn't it?     btw - upon retrospect, I had gear in the cracks off to the right with a long sling when I approached the bolt. In case it blew I wouldn't crator.  It was interesting to remember that it was "safe", maybe I looked at it and said "at least it will hold a quickdraw;" otherwise I wouldn't have even clipped it ;-p.

    Clare:  You were on the correct route, to the left of the bolt (I use the term "bolt" loosely when referring to this protection point).

    Led the first pitch of this today. Did the slab start to right of chimney: I thought it was fun (put in one pyschological nut), although a couple of years ago it haired me out.  I could not, however, find the "proper" route for the traverse at the end of the first pitch. We ended up going a ways out onto the bench and doing a hard move to scramble up a small slot to the left of the skanky looking bolt on the face. Is the "real" route to the RIGHT of the bolt, up the cracks, the right one of which has a broken off piton?  This seemed harder than 5.7! Help!

    Comments from the optimists club: lest anyone be turned off by the above comments (I almost was...) here's my take from yesterday's climb: Interesting chimney start and odd mantel/hand traverse at safe bolt. A crazy move - neat.  Belay on super ledge looking up at impressive V-slot.  2nd pitch starts with an odd sized crux with a bomber #4 - safe/fun/odd!!  Go up to the first break where two distinct shelfs appear - one being on the left of the crack and one to the right, right on the arete.  Make a belay in the crack above and have a great seat on the arete with a perfect view of your second attacking the v-slot.  From this wonderful belay, climb the last bit of good climbing up a steep corner then run it out to the summit.  I love climbs that end on the summit, and climbs with history.  If this was more sustained I could see a third star.  Two stars - just right!      The descent was not that bad - just pretend you're bushwacking in the Adirondacks and don't miss the rappel tree tucked away on the shelf to the right (as you look down the north face) - the one with the CHAIN around it - once the downclimb gets "serious".    The key to this climb?  Sunshine, the arete-seat-belay and good company...

    I did the route with a total beginner. The slab pitch was easy but run out(don't fall).  The second pitch was  a great dihederal although the v-slot was slick, it was just 1 move then a great long pitch with challenging moves.  Definately worth a look, but remember it's old school 5.7.  My partner thought it was a great route but told me to keep in mind that he didn't lead it. Remember to leave daylight for descent.Will Maercklein june 30, 00

    Did this route on April 1st, 2001 with Dave Klein - the date seemed appropriate. This climb (pitch 2) definitely seemed... odd. First I felt sandbagged by the rating, but in retrospect, maybe its just a really weird climb, and 5.7 is as good a guess as any to what the rating should be. I followed that pitch, and had a good struggle with the slick rock in the v-slot... the climb is aptly named; lets leave it at that. Previously, I had considered this as my second trad lead, but now I am very glad I just followed it. Definitely not a good beginner lead. Did we miss something? Also, descent blows when snow is still around. We ended up rapping off the back. I guess that is the definition of a "classic"?!?
    Jan 1, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The 2nd pitch is the only good pitch on this climb and the crux is a short slippery section protected by #4 Camalot...just one move and you are secure with a good hold...pretty cruiser I thought on my second lead, but first time up there I was a bit freaked by the slipperyness of this section also.... Best way to descend from the summit is to scramble to north and look for big ledge with pine tree that has chain and carpet around it...rappel from here to avoid the worst of the down-climbing.... Hardly feels like a classic climb (done it twice) but the 2nd pitch is long and fun.  Also, start the first pitch by climbing the slab to the right before entering the cave (fun)...or an easier start is around to the right from the slab up the shallow corner...the chimney sucks but is quite easy.  I'd say it's a pretty good beginner lead since it is not very sustained, has good pro and only one move of 5.7 at the crux, one of the easier 5.7s around boulder that I remember...Bailey's overhang (75 feet left of Cussin's) is a better climb than Cussin but has one move (the overhanging slot) that is 5.8...the rest is fun and sustained 5.6.  Pitch 2 goes up the grassy looking crack/corner but is actually WAY cool and sustained 5.6 with a move or 2 of 5.7 (lots of fun).....other good beginner leads at this level might be all of the 5.7s at Happy Hour Crag (the long one up the middle is fun, Malign), Washington Irving and Duh Dihedral (both 5.6 and on the West Ridge at Eldo), Your Basic Lieback (sustained 5.6 hand crack/lieback on lower Peanuts wall in Eldo), Wind Ridge, The Owl on the Dome (Cozyhang sucks bad) and many others....

    It would be nice to have a better idea where this variation goes.  There is a variation that was lead by John Matson in the 80's that uses the first piece of pro on the first pitch of Athlete's Feat but instead of mantling by the second bolt, the line traverses left below the headwall and up to the first pitch anchors of Athlete's Feat from below.  By all accounts it is pretty run out.
    Jun 19, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'm confused about where this route is. The route just left of Athlete's Feat is called Never A Dull Moment. The first pitch is a slab traverse to the right and is protected by two bolts. It is rated 12a and seems to be reasonably protected (on this first pitch). To the left of this route is Jackson's Wall Direct (aka South Face). Does it lie in between these two routes? Are the anchors shared with another route?

    This is a wonderful finish to Final Exam and deserves more attention! The holds are positive and the climbing is bouldery. I found it to be higher quality and only slightly more difficult than its neighbor, the Pass/Fail Option. The difficulty felt similar to me as other hard 11s at Castle Rock, although it may be closer to 12a/b if you are shorter?    The small gear at the start of the roof is bomber; however, it is small. We found that a bomber 0.3 X4 cam fit very well under the small gear to protect the crux. Interestingly, neither the 0.3 C4 or the yellow C3 fit in the placement. With the X4, the route felt very safe, and a ground-up effort would be a fun challenge for a solid climber. If you want to avoid rope drag, build an anchor on the slab above Final Exam and pull your rope through before tackling the roof. Go get on it!

    Awesome route. No doubt one of the best trad lines in Boulder Canyon.  One little tip for those who are interested: if you are going for the whole thing as one pitch, I highly recommend bringing triples (at least) of finger and big finger size cams (yellow and orange Metolius or equivalent) as well as extras in the #6 stopper/ #4 rock range.

    Wow.  Castle Rock is so cool.  I did this spectacular route yesterday.      I had to give the bottom mantle a couple efforts before seeing the sequence and sending it (I obviously needed some Royal Robbins boots to trust my feet) and linking into the next pitch for one general odyssey of a climb.  Holy-moly rope drag!!---extend your gear with slings, not draws at the thin changing corners crux.      Also, let's replace the spinning, rusting SMC bolts that protect the mantle.  I need a drill....    One gear beta response to the original post is that you can get really good gear above the slab, at the base of the thin corner.  At the corner is a small, secure, offset nut.  And down about 5 feet and right is bomber 1" piece or #0.5 Camalot.    Awesome.  Will definitely climb this route again sometime.

    I'll agree with the comment above.  Sic, sic, SIC climb!  The best BC has to offer.  I thought Arm's Bazaar was the best until yesterday.    Great pro the whole way with unrelenting moves.  Just go for it!  Definitely do it as one pitch, and take lots of slings.  An 11d onsight and you'll need to have your gear dialed in at the crux for a successful send.

    Sic, Sic...Sic Climb!! One of the best in the Boulder area if you can climb the Grade.  Forget the first part of Country club, just do this climb!    BE CAREFUL once you have pulled the mantle, you will certainly deck until you get something in the first dihedral, as mentioned above.      A double set of Aliens, blue to red, is the best pro for this climb, it's almost like cheating. (plus whatever you need for the crux of Country Club)  You can do this in one pitch, one rope, if you have a 70m, which will reach the anchors for athletes feet, then another short rappel down.
    Sep 17, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If you lead this in one pitch from the ground, make sure to use long slings at the start.  One idea is to clip the fixed pin and bolt on the Athlete's Feat mantle, then downclimb and unclip from the pin.  Once above the mantle reach down and change the QD on the bolt to a long runner.  Also, consider using long slings on the gear at the start of the crux section (added excitement), and don't protect right under the CC Crack roof.  I did all this and still had some rope drag on the CC Crack crux finger crack, but it was most likely just the weight of the rope.    However you do this route, it's gotta be one of the best 5.11 trad climbs anywhere.  Hats off to Alec Sharp and Bill Feiges for putting this one up.

    I think this is a great route, one of the best in the Boulder area.  In the 'changing corners' section you can have excellent protection above your head for all the hard moves. The 2nd pitch looks much harder than it turns out to be.

    Didn't lead this, but I think you can get good nuts and small cams on lead.    If you want to TR this just start 6' to the left and go up a 5.8 crack...anywhere you want below the big roof (Pass Fail) you can setup a TR anchor.  Right below the Pass Fail roof I setup and anchor with nuts/small cams, but if you have several hand size pieces you can set a belay anywhere along the way.      To descend: You can traverse across to the rap above Coffin Crack or finish Bailey's Overhang route.  I clipped the rope into the rap station and put a few pieces on the traverse before I went over there, fyi.    It felt way easier now, but still feels solid 5.11 to me.  :)  Especially if you are going to onsight this thing!

    11c/d if you know the beta?... I have to admit I led this one after numerous times on TR and figuring out the best way to place gear. So, it is probably a 12a grade for onsight, or something. Placed a 0.75 BD at the beginning, yellow C3 in the middle, and green C3 just before pulling what seems like the crux. I have not yet tried it, but probably bouldering it might be significantly easier than leading and placing gear. But you need two mats and a good spotter for it.

I give him the finishing right, left, right, jam sequence beta. This is so you end with right hand on the top hold and are able to reach out left with your left hand to Burnt Crack for the finish.     Alex steps up and proceeds to fire it. Comes down and says "Yea, you're right!"     "DAMN, Alex!"    Found memories of bouldering this, Final Exam, Acrobatic Overhang, etc. and then roping up and doing the Campaigner with Alex one day up at Castle Rock. Not only was he a great climber, he was a great guy, gracious, and great company.     Those were good days! Young and fit. Wish I could still boulder this thing now, and wish Alex was still with us.

    I ripped a cam in a fall off this yesterday.  I had an orange Metolius TCU in the last finger lock before the final "jug".  The pin scar nature of this placement (narrow, deep crack) didn't really let the cam orient properly, and I think it levered out as I fell onto it.      I was really pumped and trying to make the final move over to Black Crack when I fell.  A bomber #7 BD stopper ~4 feet below the TCU kept me off the ground (barely).  When I went back up, the same cam placed much better in the second-to-last finger lock (easy to place once you are past it).  I'm glad to say I never tested this placement the way I tested the first, but it looked much better.    This is a really fun climb, and requires faith in some really shallow locks.

    Finally got this one on the lead placing the gear.  Super fun, one of the best short routes I have done.  Bring a pad, a yellow C3 for near the top of the crack.  Once you get the jug you only need a #3 Camalot, maybe some small wires, the pin and a #1 Camalot, extend the last couple pieces.  Don't bother putting in the gear low, it probly won't keep you off the ground anyway.  Just fire the moves to the only stance and place the yellow C3 above you for the last few moves to Black Crack.  Go do it. Great climb.  Props to Gill!

    Brute force sure doesn't hurt if you are not tall.  I had to show up ready for a fight to make the redpoint.

    Definitely not a finger wrecker... I pinched my right pinky because I slotted my hand for a bomber jam, but my untaped fingers looked way better than my all-taped fingers on some S Platte crack.    There are many positive jams/locks on this route to place gear, but just remember that anything you place above your head will probably be a hold you'd want to use.
    Jun 11, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I suggest to use a pad to get off the deck before placing gear down low.  You can get a good finger lock about 15 feet up, then place a bomber piece right at your chest.  It will help you not fiddle with too much gear.  I think I used a #0.4 Camalot there, and then yellow TCU after that.

    I agree with Jason.  As far as finger cracks go, this thing really isn't painful, even without tape.  If you are not too accustomed to climbing fingercracks, you may feel some pain.  I have particular respect for Gill for doing lines like this in the style he did.

    This is a great line and it is not the finger wrecker that everyone claims it to be.

I bouldered this today, trying to live up to Gill's standards, downclimbing Black Crack after hitting the jug.  I just couldn't bring myself to climbing it in boots and sans a pad.  Even with technology, like sticky rubber on my shoes, Gill will always be better then me...

    Slightly painful fingerlock at the crux but good climbing.  I believe it could have been climbed/developed as a trad route... and I'd advocate that sort of climbing.  As a trad lead it looks engaging but not dangerous. Sm-med stoppers, small cams, and maybe a ball-nut if you wanted to do it completely boltless and without a runout.  Will have to go back when it is not raining and give it a go as such.  To answer the question above from Mark Roth, I think the #3 goes high and left between the last bolt and the anchor.

    This is fun TR after doing curving crack.  I think the stemming moves and liebacks are a kick in the pants!    Would be a serious lead, however.  Probably more fun and quicker  to do a few laps on TR then to lead it.    I personally think that its pretty stout for a 9.

    All in all, this climb turned out to be surprisingly pleasant. For sure, it was the final pitch to the top that made it well worth it. Only had to place one cam the entire route as pitons and fixed gear abound.

    Just did this this weekend (actually the 5.9 varaiation that goes up the face to the same first belay spot). Wanted to mention that THE ANCHORS HAVE BEEN CHOPPED. Either that, or I was way way off route, but there is a obvious ledge after the chimney that would be a nice belay station where you can see that 3 anchors/bolts have been chopped. Just so you know.
    Jul 13, 2015

    I thought the chimney was rather straightforward. I have leather patches on my pants and used knee locks until I could stand on the rather comforting inside ledge. There were two places I could get small wires for decent protection.

    We climbed this on 6/20/13, and there was a nasty loose rock on the exposed traverse just above the bolted belay.  It's marked with a couple white Xs, but they look to be fading.  It's something you will want to grab if you're not paying attention, and there's a good chance it would hit your belayer or folks on the ground below.  Be careful!    Other that that, we found this climb better than expected.  The chimney start isn't particularly fun, but the rest of the route is quite nice.

    It definitely makes more sense to break this up into 4 short leads to avoid awful rope drag.
    May 16, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Even though the book says to climb this in two pitches, I usually go in four. I do the slab start R of the chimney, then up to the gully. P2 goes up to the bolted belay. P3 is kinda a guide trick. I do the traverse around the roof, go up the corner to its top and belay right there. It's short but allows great communication between everyone and makes the last pitch a bit more pleasant for the leader.  Really a great route.

    One of the easier climbs on Castle Rock; honest at 5.6. Biggest part is getting back down via North Face descent. Did this the 1st time in December 1961 while home from Army on leave. Icy nightmare getting down!
    Mar 12, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    We broke this climb into four short pitches.  This significantly reduces rope drag and makes communication a little easier.  With a 50m rope stopping above the chimney at the obvious ledge is probably a better option then trying to stretch it all the way to the bolts anyway.    With the exposure above the bolted belay and the high potential for rope drag, I wouldn't recommend this route for beginning leaders.  Lots of fun though!
    Sep 21, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Weird route. The first pitch (or two as some people do it) is not very aesthetic or fun, at all. Once you reach the bolted belay, the climbing is steep and fun for the grade, but be very mindful of rope drag, unless of course you are fond of climbing one handed with a mouthful of slack just to manage the drag....    If you can, run it out a bit, it's much more enjoyable that way.
    Sep 20, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Only about 10 feet of rope remain (using a 60m) when finished belaying the leader up this fun climb.  For my first real chimney, the start of Jackson's Wall was a challenge but fun to try to figure out (though not much rock suitable for pro placement) how to climb (you can also climb the face, but pro is very limited)!  For the chimney, first face left, then half way up you have to turn around and face right, then move out on the face for a bit until you catch the crack up to the short traverse right to the rather obvious belay ledge.  On P2 there are a couple of exposed moves you have to do, but relatively easy climbing.  The second move after the ledge is a bit of a push up onto a ledge about 6" wide at most that is made by a rather sharp flake.  You can try to do a foot jam in the flake while you pull yourself up, but I found this to be a bit awkward when trying to get my foot out at a sharp angle while pushing up onto the ledge.  If you go left, you will find some footholds that will help you.  The next move is a high step right up onto a narrow stone ridge-like flake that gives a lovely view between it and the main rock down to the road and water below.  From there up it gets easier and less exposed.  Nice variety of moves required.  Relatively easy walk off the opposite side down to the left.  Enjoy!  Girasol

    Two FEISTY ravens have built a large nest in the ramp just before you exit right at the top of the first pitch.  Though it would have added some spice to the route, we opted not to challenge them.
    Apr 1, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A few notes:    I didn't like the looks of the chimney start for my beginner on the first pitch, so I opted for the slab to the right.  I was able to place a stopper (which popped out) about 8 feet off the ground, and then I ran it out the rest of the way (about 25 feet from the ground).  Good 5.6 s  warm up for the 4th class hiking above.    Make sure you don't stop in the gully until you hit the double bolt chain anchor at the base of the crux pitch.  Less pitches that way.    Be careful of rope drag on the crux pitch.  I found I was zig zagging a lot looking for the easiest line.  The 5.8 direct finish would have probably been less draggy (and more fun).  But then I'd be hauling my 2nd up manually.     Fun route overall.  Though I couldn't really see it, since I was doing an after work sunset race.

    Tell ya what, go and aid it first and see what you think of the gear, and the major lack of useable features. We never got up it....    Sounds like your gear options are either:  1. Aid the line and test the placments and replace what rips (you're probably gonna whip as I ripped one by hand and blew out on a time bomb that tested well).    2. Rap the line and fix enough heads to deem the route sane (hopefully you're good at heading as the placements are tricky as they are mostly chiseled out placments in a awkwardly bottoming, shallow, flared seam).    3. Retro bolting, hopefully on lead, and infrequently at that. Only with the FA's permission.     The line is damn bleak in general even when hanging from gear. I don't know how many people actually repeated this route.    I feel it's either X/ borderline insane and super hard or it's downgraded for any future aid ascentionist and still super hard.    Seems in either domain (free or aid) it's a test piece. Unless you're contemplating the X rated/ borderline insane, how do you justify that it would be ok to retro bolt and down grade an aid test piece just to put up some mixed protected free test piece?     Just curious, it's a bit of a sensitive subject for me.  I don't mean to single you out, but I think someday I'd like to finish the route up and hopefully in its current condition. I feel like China Doll in Upper Dream Canyon would have been a much more enjoyable route before it was retro protected for the free ascent (same with the aid roof on castle rock). I think it would be the same case here, and I am not condoning that even if it already is a chipped up heading line that will require someone who is really really good at heading to see a repeat.

    Attempted to put up the straight up variation on pitch 1 today. It's a bummer, but the only edge to hook on has been blown out. I was high stepping off a hybrid Alien hoping to get a Pecker in upside down in the roof as I could just about reach upto it, the hybrid was a time bomb and next thing I know I land on 2 separate heads with screamers on them (one was my adj. daisy with a screamer) both screamers deployed paritally and I didn't have to whip like Eric when he attmepted this. He broke his finger when the edge he was hooking on blew and he ripped a few pieces (falling 20 ft, nearly decked on slabs below).  I got stabbed in the leg with a Pecker when I came to a stop. The straight up variation of pitch 1 hasn't gone for a reason....    Still need to get back up and try to rebate the second pitch.
    Feb 22, 2009

    STOUT! A rebate is in order. I need to learn the art of tough heading first though. Only 1 fixed dead head still in place off the ramp on P2, I ripped the first one (fixed head) while trying to get something in above. Time bomb! I decked on the ledge safely enough. Then I came in from the seam just to the left via hooks to Peckers finally making a large reach to pound in a beaked RURP atop the dead head. Made my way up and made another long reach up to the next fixed head and clipped it, then ripped it out by hand essentially. We decided to bail as we had no #0 heads and I didn't feel capable of learning the art of hard heading on the sharp end on a route rated A4 in the guide. Yep, I bit off a little more then I could chew here on this one, I was hoping for more good fixed heads I think. Now I have a good project to work on, and a new skill to hone.

    A few years ago I went up and tried to TR the second pitch(solo). There were fixed heads everywhere! I started up and the 3rd fixed head off the ramp blew! I was just moving onto it and hadn't moved my Tr device up or unclipped my daisy from the previous piece. I took a short fall and when I stopped I realised I had broken the cable of the previous head in half, with the loop still attached to my daisy and the head still in the rock! I cleaned the deadhead and tried to place another but could not get it to stick. If you are going to try this route you will probably need a sharp punch to place this #1 head. Also most of the head placements appeared to be chiseled?

    I haven't led first two pitches of this climb since 1986. I used to combine these pitches as one, using double ropes. I can understand how someone would call this 5.12b, especially since the block is gone past the crux moves of the crack. After some desperate lieback moves, a juggy wedged block was reached. The block moved but didn't pull off, because it sat a big slot that opened up in the thin crack corner. The jug / block gave you a good place to shake out before the final 10 feet of the climb. Without it, the second pitch must be harder.    I consider the second pitch to be R rated. The unprotected traverse to start the pitch is quite committing.    The rest of the pitch protects quite well, but I wouldn't consider doing it without two sets of RPs or #2-6 Black Diamond steel nuts. I also placed a #1 Friend, #2.5 Friend, &amp; a #11 or 12 stopper. I was surprised to see Peter's gear description recommend small to medium stoppers &amp; not tiny nuts (micro-stoppers) or RPs. I was just looking at an old gear topo I drew back in the 1980s in my personal diary.    I can also understand how someone would think the first pitch was 5.12b. The first pitch is quite hard especially if you are tall with a big chest. While hanging on fingernail edges &amp; traversing the sloping shelf, the wall bulges a bit into my chest. This wants to push me off. Shorter climbers seem to have a bit easier time, as their arms are straighter (not chicken winged) &amp; the bulge is more at face level.

    The first pitch slab traverse is my vote for the hardest 5.12 in the Front Range. Has it ever been on-sighted on lead? For that matter, how many people have even lead it in the last decade?

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Just ran across the comments on this one and had to pipe in as it brought back memories. The slab pitch is some tedious  footwork and balance, helped by fingernails on micro-edges to just stay in balance. However,I always thought the crack was harder than the slab.  Although the slab could be harder now due to degradation of the micro fingernail holds. It took me multiple attempts, with Maurice Reed, Jeff Achey, and others over several different days to finally get the crack on this clean in the early '80s. Protection was tricky, and the finish was always the big stopper for me and seemed to be the real crux overall. A hard Castle Rock classic testpiece for sure!

    Thanks, Topher. The decision to add these anchors was not taken lightly. The reasons Topher gives are real, and I discussed the placement plenty before deciding where to place them. When you reach the no hands stance for the anchors, the climb is over. To get to the Athlete's Feat chains is 20ft of 5.4.
    Apr 28, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I didn't place the new anchor, but I was in on the discussion deciding to add it.  The reason for the  new anchor was to prevent the rope from running across, and leveraging when top-roping, the big, detached block which sits on the slab between the lip and the bolted anchor on Athlete's Feat. It seemed like a matter of time and freeze/thaw cycles before someone pulled it down with lethal results.

    BIG THANKS to whoever recently added the 2-bolt anchor on top of this rig. Grade, stars for direct start.

    Maybe it's just another case of routes feeling different to different people.  I sent both Arms and Spoils in a couple days of work while Never A Dull Moment is still spanking me.  Never A Dull Moment (slab linked into crack as one pitch)  feels miles harder than any 12a or b trad I have done anywhere in the Front Range.      Grade discussion aside (as it is a rather silly dicussion in the first place), this is one stellar chunk of granite with beautiful movement, excellent rock and continiously difficult movement.  Further proof that Alec Sharp had a master eye for finding routes.

    Adam, I've not been back on the route since you &amp; I were there. I shameless took the grade from Rossiter's book; how am I to judge what the grade of the original traverse is if I haven't been able to do it? Still, I don't think doing the traverse would add any pump to the rest of the route. In that respect, I'd think Evictor is much harder.    This is the only climb (original traverse) I've been on where I think I'd have a better chance of making the move if I strap some weights on my ankle (to shift my weight balance).    As for BoCan grade, Rossiter called both Arms Bazaar and The Spoils @ 12a and I'd think the latter is easily 1 letter grade (if not 2) harder than the former and would be a bit sandbagged for 12a.

Having toproped this many times, I kept thinking "This would be a good ABC Headpoint" - meaning an elementary or introductory level headpoint, in the sense that you can fall a long distance but are unlikely to get hurt.

    Only 30 feet of new terrain, Chris, but it's a wild 30!

Nobody's Home goes about halfway out the roof before going straight up to the Country Club anchor.    I know the Nobody's Home headwall has been toproped for years by going out to the arete and then foot traversing back across the sloping ramp that is part of Nobody's Home, but I don't know of it being led that way.

    This roof has some great moves and a wild lip.    A few comments about gear and rope drag.  Linking into this straight out of Final Exam is a great pitch, but the rope drag can be problematic.  Once onto the slab after Final Exam, set a few pieces and drop a loop of rope to your belayer.  Then you can go back on belay without the rope running through all of the gear on Final Exam to avoid that drag.  Your rope will only be going through the pieces you placed on the slab.      A green Alien is the best piece I found to protect the move up into the roof crack, and a green Camalot (0.75) protects the roof crack.  The gear is good and the fall is clean -- I proved this several times before finally getting this thing clean!    Also there is a new(ish) anchor about 10' up and right after pulling the roof.  It is the top of "The Dropout Option" (12+, not on this site yet).  You can lower to the ground from here with a 60m rope.

    Beta alert: seemed like a very long reach up and right from obvious, chalked-up hold; I couldn't get it and fell (I'm sure it would go that way, just need a little more reach and/or horsepower). Next try, I did another move up and left to a less obvious hold (layback), then reached right; seemed substantially easier that way. Not sure what is the "normal" way.

    Attempted to top-rope this route on Saturday after leading the 5.6 pitch to the left. The remnants of the missing feature that fell off in 2013 is quite obvious to spot as a brown spot is left in its wake. Without this hold, the route is very difficult, and none of our team could get through the roof boulder problem. There seems to be a way to climb up and left out onto two horn-like features before launching to a prominent hold out towards the second bolt. We were too sauced to make the move though. Be careful of loose rock on the slab above the roof. I've seen large chunks come crashing down off of this area.

    Climbed this route this morning without the "broken foothold".  I don't know how the climb was before, but it did not feel significantly harder than 11b/c now.  I did use other beta than described above. Instead of using the hold I just used the small "dish" to the right of the bolt.

    This morning the foothold under the first bolt fell as I was following a friend up the route.  We didn't try it a second time, but it looks like a significant change to the climb.

    Fun roof moves that are over all to soon.  The upper section of climbing after the roof is less than desired and has some lose rock!!!  However, it's still fun and I would probably do it again, but it would not be my first choice.
    Aug 25, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The climbing above the roof, in my opinion isn't all that great. The crux moves are fun.    It is possible to get some psychological pro in the wet crack before you clip the first bolt, but don't hope for much, and you would want to back clean it after clipping the bolt. You know how it is when your intimidated, you think weird things...ha.    For a TR, climb the first pitch of the west face and move right at the top.    It is possible to continue on to climb the Big Deal Pinnacle. I remember it being a bit crumbly and run out. Then, from there you could finish with the west face.    I wouldn't do it again.

    I'd agree with 2 stars and 11b (I'm 6'2).  This is a really cool climb - pumpy and weird - once you get it done it's not too bad the second time 'round.  . . though going for the crux move out of the roof is a bit intimidating.
    Oct 11, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There's good crack at the base of the roof and positive holds out to the edge of the roof.  Pulled this off on TR by swinging the right foot out and up onto a small ledge just past the middle of the roof, then pushed off opposing with the right hand over the left shoulder shifting my weight into the rock using the corner of a small block, then switching hands, reached again with the right hand for the corner of another small block higher.  As Tony mentions your going from a horizontal position back to standing up vertical. Very weird move.  Remember bruising the inside of my calf as it passed over the 1st bolt (as it protrudes about 2") doing the move.

    Route 66! Aye, you better be ready to deal with &amp; enjoy, just about all types of climbing on this old school, adventure classic -- everything from solid granite to stacked blocks to lichen, moss, &amp; tree detritus. I've looked at this route for years and finally had the chance to climb it with a much stronger climber than myself today. To begin, we waded Boulder Creek up above our knees to get to the dry boulders at the base of the route where we harnessed and geared up. I chose to keep my now soaked La Sportiva Ghanda Guide boots on to climb and was very glad I did as the granite is hard and the cracks are wider. Bring it all from smallest Aliens to a #4 BD Camalot, you will use most if not all. Also bring a good nut tool, 'cause you will probably be doing some gardening. The climbing ranged from 5.5 mossy slab at the top to 5.9+ slot/wide crack physicality down low. Four half pitches, diverse and full focus one and all. While I was belaying, I looked down at the happy whitewater creek with a flyfisherman and thought +++ this is Colorado! As Kellen said: "I had a blast!"

    Friend Casey said, "nah, I don't want to picnic and climb at C.R. 'cause it is too greasy." I didn't know what he meant until trying this one, and now I do. Wow. Slick, like the guy said. Easier to second, as you can layback the first section with the slick feet, but if you are leading, it is tricky to layback and protect at the same time. For on-sight, 10a, I thought, but did 2nd lap following and maybe 9+ is ok for that. Definitely worth doing. And, there are now chains at the top of this, so no need to move over to top of Curving Crack for those chains.

    I was still mystified by all the zippers and pockets on my new $80 climbing pants when my partner yelled "off belay, good luck..." The first few feet of Skunk Crack is slicker then a Jiffy-Lube garage floor at closing time.Being able to torque myself into the handjam above the initial fingerlock felt tough but extracting my shoulder out of the wider midsection nearly required medical attention. Nothing like an old school 5.9 to start me back sportclimbing!
    Sep 11, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This short route offers a tricky opening sequence right off the ground. A crack inside a narrow groove widens for just a few inches which allows a tenuous two knucle deep finger lock for the left hand. The feet in the first two moves are vague and most folks use the crack for the right foot and stem/smear on the polished left face.  10' farther up a shallow, shoulder width, slightly inverted chimney must be overcome.  Good pro here, but again a tricky sequence since its so tight, you can't see your feet, but a nice high right hand crack saves the day allowing you to pull through (I've seen climbers avoid this squeeze by pulling left over a lip to gain the easy ground).  When this sequence is overcome, most people stop to catch their breath, I know I did. The remainder of the pitch is (5) and most parties go to the chains above curving crack to rap.

    The Corinthian Vine P2 is probably a better option than traversing. It offers better climbing in my opinion. It's decently protected despite D'Antonio's "R" rating for that pitch. Protected by what seems to be a glued in copperhead.... It seems logical to fire up this corner/roof and then traverse into the remaining P3 of South Face. Or, instead of moving slightly left as for South Face, continue straight up a thin corner protected by a pin. Good line, good funk, OK gear to boot.

    Did this today and it felt awfully hard. Harder than the 10a's I've done at Eldo. Also, why is that bolt even there? If you're going to add a bolt, might as well do it where it would help and not cause a big pendulum. Just my $0.02. I also felt the gear wasn't very obvious, small, and fairly run-out. Not for the new 5.9 leader.

    Climbed this today with a friend who suckered me into leading the second pitch. I enjoyed the climb but got really tweaked out about the traverse.  That swing looked daunting, but the stretchy move is there.  Really wished there was some pro below besides a sketchy notch (one piton could prevent a serious injury, but alas). Take your pick...run out or pendulum - but as far as the rest of the climb...amazing.

    A great and confusing finish....  It seems that I could find many finishes with great variation in there difficulty.  I found that route finding tough and interesting after (P1).  Such a fantastic wall!!  As the cold and darkness set in, we had to bail just 40ft from the summit because we took so long on the route finding provided how much time we had left of good sun and day light.  So, we rapped out with a new found respect and interest in the many possibles of routes on the (2nd &amp; 3rd) pitches.  What a great, huge wall to play on.  This January day was a tough one, but we had a great time!!  A fantastic route that should be explored more!!!

    Just led this route today.  Took a 5 ft whiper on the first pitch crux when I was fumbling for a draw for the piton - shouldn't have, but it felt good to take another whipper on gear.  Led the third pitch and thought the left crack (the upside down V) looked harder than the left facing crack on the right - so I went right.  Well, I think I was wrong.  I saw the lower traverse left, but then saw the bolt and thought that the "proper" traverse was a little higher up - and figured I'd come back again later for the lower traverse left.  I got up into the pod above the bolt and had my left hand about 6" from the "good" hold and backed off because I thought the feet were sketchy.  I then put together a new game plan went back at it again, only to back off again. The third time was the charm, back to the original game plan - a right gaston pulling hard to keep the hip in and a left reach for the visibly worn hand hold.  The hold wasn't that good, but it was good enough to pull through the crux.  Trust the feet, they are good enough.  I was very relieved to get to the point and wrap a sling around for my second.  Anyway, I have no clue what I did or how to rate the pitch, but after reading these comments and since there was a ton of lichen on it, I don't think I did the "normal" traverse and I don't I think it's a 5.9+ - but I could be wrong.  I would love to get back for the lower traverse - it looked sweet.  Oh yeah, the 3rd pitch has a nut on the ramp that my second couldn't get out - if someone gets it, of course, enjoy it and let me know how you got it out - I worked on it for 15 minutes on rappel to no avail.  Anyone have a clue what I climbed?
    Jul 12, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I climbed this great route yesterday, it was an eye opener at the crux section.  On the last pitch, instead of going right and finishing on the ramp, I wandered left and up and got caught on some  slopey area.  In the book it looked like there was a 8 variation that way.  There was a big undercling that I used to continue left - I think the 8 section went strait up from there but don't know.    I think I went too far left and then tried to finish up two different cracks - the left one had a medium bush/tree at the top near the big ledge.  It seemed that this area doesn't get alot of traffic as there was dirt and a bit of rock exfoliation.  Does anyone know if this is an upper pitch to another climb?
    Jun 13, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The first pitch crux (10a in Rossiter) seemed much easier than the traverse on the second pitch.  I would say 5.9 (possibly R) is a good rating for the climb overall.  That second pitch is scary!

    Dear Mike McHugh,    I can relate to what you wrote. When I look at some of the things I climbed and how I climbed them twenty years ago, it just scares the heck out of me.  How did I ever live to see grandchildren? Isn't it funny that when we are young, with so much life ahead of us, that we take so many chances.  Then, when we get older, and have less years left, that we take less chances and become so much more conservative in our climbing practices?

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Did the route today, and all I have to say is the traverse is a good 5.9 lead to do if you think you're ready for a 5.10 lead. It'll certainly put things in perspective.  10a seems right, with solid 9 for the rest of that pitch.    Re protecting the traverse:  there is a good TCU placement (like Metolius #0 or #1, can't remember) under the small undercut that's at waist level when you're at the stance to begin crossing.  It's a good hold too, but I found I was a lot happier using it as placement than as a hold.  And I know it's good because it held my fall as I was trying to work out that sandbag traverse.  I would recommend that placement to anyone -- unless you're into a  "20 footer on a good nut".

    Fred,    The 10c variation you mention is the 2nd pitch of Corinthian Vine. The first pitch of this route is the Boot Lead. The 3rd pitch is rated 12c/d and is bolted. I agree that Corinthian Vine's 2nd pitch makes a great variation to the South Face. When I did it, I combined it with the first pitch of the South Face (still not that long of a pitch). My partner then traversed left to rejoin the regular South Face. There are three different ways to do this traverse.    Bill
    Jul 25, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I don't know the name of this variation, but there is a fun and interesting 10c roof/dihedral about half way down the ledge on the first pitch, that leads to anchors above Boot Lead &amp; Close To The Edge. These anchors provide a way to rap down and, better still, TR those 2 excellent (and hard!) routes. Also, the face to the right of this variation is another interesting option. The Falcon Guide suggest 10d for this, but it felt harder to me (esp. comparing it to the 10c), more like 11b at least. The gear is sparse, a single button head protecting the tricky crux high on the face being the only pro above the ledge.
    Jul 25, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Steve, I couldn't agree with you more.  With regard to this particular route, moving/adding the bolt would completely change its character - it might still be a 5.9, but it wouldn't be Jackson's Wall Direct.  While the upper crux isn't what I would call "well-protected", it's not a death fall by any means.      I'm sure I'm biased in this regard because of my perspective.  The "rush" I get from climbing comes when I am tested on multiple fronts - climbing ability, ability to quickly place reliable protection, route-finding, and perhaps most importantly, judgment and common sense.  The routes I aspire to lead are ones that present all of these challenges in varying degrees - an approach that doesn't always equate to pure climbing difficulty.  Even if I never have the ability or nerve to climb them, it's nice to know that 7 Arrows, Jules Verne, The Lion, and many others are still around in something resembling their original state - it's what keeps me coming back.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I too thought that the initial "crux" moving out of the crack and on to the ledge was easier than 5.10a.  I said 5.8+ as well.  My shorter partner disagreed. On the upper crux, the traverse past the bolt, I felt the move was 5.9+, but was insecure enough to be ennervating at any grade of difficulty.  I mover up, clipped the bolt, then moved back down and did the move.  I and my partner both agreed that while this move was not terribly difficult, that it seemed slick and a little off-balance.  It seemed more likely that you might slip from it than fall for lack of skill. BTW, I am 5'10" and have exceptionally long arms.  Dianne is 5'5", I believe.    Hopefully this does not start some huge flame war.

    Now, Mr. Lang, I'm no city slicker, but I know my way around a brain teaser. Are you tellin' me that 'with a simian wingspan' the move is 5.9, and for shorter folks, who can't reach across to the good left edge, it is...5.9? C'mon now, you're a dodgy coot! Well, it'll get upgraded soon, good thing I led it while it was still 5.9. 5.10 is hard.     Am I back to budding? nuts.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Kreighton, you must have been a lawyer in a past life :)  I haven't been cross-examined in a while.  As noted in a previous comment, I'm happy to leave the grade of the whole climb as 5.9. That said, and since you asked for it: P2 will be 5.9 if you have a simian wingspan.  If you have a normal wingspan and are out of shape like me, the pitch will still be 5.9, but it will feel a whole hell of a lot like some 10a climbs you may have done, with sparse and finicky protection throughout.  A budding 5.9 trad leader is likely to be uncomfortable.
    Aug 13, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Geez Darin, is that P2 5.9 or 5.9+?? Inquiring minds want to know!     Interestingly, the lower traverse appeared to have two options: traverse on the heavily chalked holds with bad feet (hard, I think those are sucker holds) or higher up with feet on the chalked holds and thin hands. If  you have a long reach, you might be able to reach from the bomber right hand over to the left edge, but it was a balancy move for short lil' me.     The bolt, if you're a scaredy cat, will protect the 5.9 moves. Just climb up, clip it with a long runner, and then back down and do the traverse. This works best with double ropes, but there is pretty much no gear for the left rope except for a shitty nut placed in the worst of the sucker holds. I thought P2 of this route was tough, a bit hard to protect and "definitely 5.9"...whatever...YMMV
    Aug 13, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Thanks for bursting my bubble, Steve - and I thought I was just a better climber than I was when I did the route the first time a few years ago.  Actually, I was perfectly happy to keep the rating at 9, and wasn't even aware of the "new" 10a rating until I looked at someone else's BC guidebook.  There are still plenty of good and honorable sandbag 9's left, though.  5.9 is a bit ephemeral anyway - could be anything from 5.8+ to 10c.  The only thing more uncertain is "easy third class".
    Jul 13, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Would grade this as 5.10, the crux on P2 with its dicy traverse with the potential of a pendulum or long wipper is a good 5.10, rest of that pitch is 5.8+ Doug B
    Jul 9, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    P2 variation:  instead of going right into the left-facing flake and then up to the traverse(s), go directly up from the belay to get on a good ledge (left of flake).  Above is an upside-down V cracks in the slightly past vertical face.  Climb the left crack (way thin... RPs and small Aliens) and some face holds to the left of that.  The crux is at the top of the V, pulling over the bulge (.10+?).  This ramp goes to a ~.8 crack (with crappy bush in the middle) for about 15 feet to the normal belay.  I am not sure what this variation is, but it is difficult and fun (please confirm).  I think is a more direct option than risking the scary pendulums....
    Jun 26, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Rossiter rates this a 10a in the more recent BC guide.  Interestingly, he puts the 10a crux at the initial traverse out of the hand crack, where I indicated "P1 crux (5.8)".  OK, maybe the move was harder than 8, but I'm not sure its 10a.  I might go along with 10a on the upper pitch, though.    Also, I noted that the bolt on top of the right-leaning ramp was "off route".  This is only partially true.  It is off route if you take the 9+ traverse in the middle of the ramp and climb to the pin.  It is right on route if you climb to the top of the ramp and then make a 10a traverse to the same point.  Apparently there used to be an old star-drive located at this spot, replaced with the current bomber bolt a few years ago by a civic-minded Neptune employee.

    To the above, the obvious retort is "maybe so, but nobody bolted Gill Crack."  For my own part, I can see this one going either way.  The lead is different that a TR because you have to get stances to clip on lead, whereas you can just slap away on TR.  However, I can see it feeling a bit close to Curving Crack too.    Too bad it's not a few feet further away such that it would be evaluated more on it's own merit, as the climbing is actually pretty novel and interesting.  But where it is is where it is and the historical precedent of the climbs surrounding it leave it in a compromised position.    The climbing is all tension and slopers.  Mid-5.11 sounds about right. I don't think 11a nor 11d.

    It is NOT a squeeze job or whatever. It is a pretty good route, pretty well bolted. Does not need any more or any less bolts. Definitely a good addition to Castle Rock.

    Great route.   My partner used the arete to move past the second bolt and then straight up past it second go round.  Awesome sloper slapping up and super crimp pulling.  Short but sweet.    IMHO, NOT a squeeze job at all as you can't use either crack to protect this climb on lead in any way.  If you want to argue that it should have been top roped only, fine, but how many people go out looking to TR stuff?   I see no problem here.

    While possibly "a sqeeze job" at first site, this route climbs extremely well.  The bolts in no way impede on routes to the right or left.  It looks to be about 5.8 but certainly feels like 11b once you're on it.  I was glad to clip each bolt, especially the last one.  A worthy addition; put in by a guy who has been a silent steward of Castle Rock for some time now.

    I agree with the poster above that these bolts are placed in extremely poor taste.  This is a squeeze line placed adjacent to ultra-classic clean lines pioneered in the early 1960s.  These bolts are immediately left of Curving Crack and the route name does not match the write-up above.      Will the person who placed these bolts please take it upon themselves to carefully remove these bolts without damaging the rock any more than they already have?  That would show some integrity.

    The 12a slab crux on the second pitch can be bypassed by traversing right, moving up to a headwall, and underclinging back left. Fun moves, but not recommended on lead.  Done this way, the pitch becomes solid 5.11 with the crux at the second bolt.    Lots of great moves on this pitch, but it needs more cleaning.

Use the amazingly good left foot, a higher right hand hold, and your inner thigh muscles to slowly elevate to good crimps (left hand) right of all that chalk on the rail.

    I think I know where the name, Tongo, came from.    In the sixties Hanna-Barbera had a kid's entertainment hour on TV called The Banana Splits.  A regular feature was a show called Danger Island. Whenever the tree-swinging, Tarazan-like, hero came to the rescue everyone would cry out: "Uh oh, Tongo!".  The hero's name was really Chongo, but google reminded me that most of us heard is as Tongo.    It would be really cool to find out from Pat Ament where the name came from.  This route sorta makes me feel like a tree-swinging chimp.

    The climb is probably soft for 5.11- if you are of average height or taller, but the bottom section is hard for shorter people (&lt;5'6"). This climb is probably a 5.11a modern sport grade or old-school 10d.

    Ben Mottinger said, "If you do just the first pitch, it is straight fwd 10a to the chains." I strongly diagree. If you're a 10a climber you don't want to be leading this pitch. Compared to the 10a sport and mixed routes being put up these days, the first pitch of Tongo is on another planet in terms of difficulty. Although technically more difficult, I had an easier time leading P2 than P1. Speaking as a tall person with no recent experience as a short person, I would think that the start of P1 and the crux on P2 would be very difficult for shorter than average people (e.g. most women), although thin fingers might make up for lack of reach on P2.    For all you Crack n Up fans (there must be some?), I placed a very good beefy Crack'n Up above the obvious brass nuts to proctect the moves off the ledge on P2. It made me feel better. I placed 4 pieces at the crux (after reading of Bill Wright's winger) including a tipped out #1 Camalot in the "hole" at the roof. A #2, if it fits though the opening, would be better. Also got a very good aluminum HB offset way high, giving a toprope at the crux.    Question: How hard is the left start to P1? Looks real hard to me.    Feeling old suddenly.... Looked in my old guidebooks and see that the first (and only other) time I did Tongo was in October '77, my first semester here in grad school.

    I, and I think most people, actually start on "After Forever" (#32 in Rossiter's book).  Make a move or two up up the slab just left of the start for "Atlas Shrugged".  Then pop up and left (harder for short people) to handrail left along a 10' long ledge and then mantel up at it's left side.  At this point you can clip the bolt (1st pro on the pitch).  Climb straight up to the fixed pin on "Tongo" and then continue to angle up and right with that route.  This is a very enjoyable route!Don't forget to TR "Atlas Shrugged" now that you have the rope up.  You can get a directional for that up high with a med tcu, or just go for the big swing if you fall.

    I tried to link this route as one pitch since the second pitch was so short. I put in what I thought was a bomber red Alien straight up underneatth the roof and then couldn't figure out how to do the crux. If you know the trick this move isn't that bad and it is really just one move or two, but it was too much for me to onsight and I pitched off. I pulled the Alien and fell about 30+ feet (missing the ledge thankfully and I'm not sure how I missed it) and was caught by the draw clipped to the first belay anchors. It was quite exciting when the piece blew, but I didn't hit anything at all - steep up there.

    The first pitch is S.  The second pitch is about 20' long and might be the softest 11a trad pitch in the canyon.  Not  sure why it isn't done as 1 pitch; maybe because of risk of hitting ledge after rope stretch.  There are chains at  the first belay and large  rap hangers at the second.    Atlas Shrugged can be top roped from the chains at the end of  p1.

    This used to be a fun little pitch of aid back in the day. I'd like to add a shout out to Bob Sandefer who was my instructor back in 1971 when I took the Colorado Mountain Club climbing class. This is the only route I know of with his name on it, but he climbed many obscure routes back in the '60s without recording them. Bob had a prodigious knowledge of little known (at the time) climbing areas and left only an occasional fixed pin in the cracks to remind us of his many ascents.

    This is an awesome little route deserving of more attention. Similar in style, albeit much harder, to the "first" pitch of CCC.    I'm not sure if it has lost holds since the FFA, but it's definitely 5.13 in its current state. I'd call the opening boulder V8 or V9. It involves a tricky stab to a mono and then a creative gaston/thumb catch. This sequence will be very hard for the short.    The upper half of the pitch consists of fun 5.12 finger crack climbing. Bring a single set to 0.75 and a few small wires for the crack portion. Move right (not left) at the top of the crack to an anchor on Radio Armada.    It would be easy to work the opening boulder problem on toprope from the anchor atop "pitch one" of CCC with a few directionals.

    I led the first pitch yesterday and found it quite enjoyable. This was my wife's first lead belay and her sister's first climb. Perfect route for a beginner to follow.    The rock seems mostly solid. I didn't find any loose pieces, though I'm very used to climbing loose rock from years of climbing at Pinnacles (California). I think there might be one move of 5.6 on the regular start, though I doubt I could really discern the difference from 5.5, so I'll defer to the crowd on the rating.    The bolts and chains were solid. Gear placement on the pitch was pretty straightforward. I did come up with a booty piece (someone left a nut about 3/4 of the way up which I used on the way up, and it came out easily when I cleaned the pitch).

    I'd echo Charles' questions about the route. I did it in three pitches, and on the last pitch, you are rewarded with multiple options up.     There is a chimney which is probably the 5/6 way. An offwidth that popped out my shoulder and a crack in the left with some interesting moves that is certainly harder than 6.    It's weird to discuss in depth 3 sections of no more than 12 feet of climbing, but I would also be curious about the official way (chimney at right, I'm guessing?) and the ratings of the others. Specifically, that damn OW.    -- ALSO --    There are no rap-rings (that I could find), and the walkoff kind of sucks, because it's more of a downclimb. If you don't think you can do 5.4 moves in reverse, maybe plan on burning some gear.    Edit to add: looks like the route goes significantly to the right of where I was. Maybe that explains all the lichen....

    Did in 4 pitches (to true summit) to minimize rope drag and communication issues. Good pro at every pitch.  P1. Up to bolted anchor - simple 5.5 with ample pro.  P2. Up left just past the tower on the right, good anchor stance to the left of small pine tree.  P3. This is where it got confusing - we found ourselves looking up at chimney to the right, v-slot above and crack to the left. None of the past descriptions indicated which line to follow. Ended up doing zig zag, between the v-slot and left onto face and crack. Slot felt like the crux. Anchor where leveled out above.  P4. Up the short crack on the right to false summit, then 4th class to the summit.    Anyone have ratings specific to each option going left of the the tower and past the pine tree?  1) Far left crack.  2) V-slot.  3) Chimney to the right.  Thanks!

    I lead this on October 24th 2015, and it seemed like a really nice route.

I did not notice the loose rock that others had mentioned. I also didn't notice any snakes; however, I have seen snakes in the area, so it's probably worth keeping an eye out.

    Did this route yesterday and it's definitely a decent climb if you're still fairly new to trad. I took a few friends up with me who don't climb much on gear, and it was a fun climb for the grade.    I'd definitely recommend breaking this up into three pitches and building a belay right behind the "tower" above pitch one anchors, otherwise rope drag is awful. We didn't go directly to the summit, but there's a great tree to belay off of on the flat north side. The summit can be still reached from there with a small scramble around the back side.    The downclimb to the rap anchor isn't bad, just take your time (head towards the road). You'll see the tree with chains around it about 25-30ft down.
    May 29, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Started in the chimney and it wasn't too bad. Giving it a higher rating, because the second pitch is pretty stout for a 5.5. All in all, fun route.     The "walkoff" on the back is more of a 5.4 downclimb. For those who do not enjoy down climbing, on my way down I did see a tree with a chain on it about 15 feet down the back side. Requires a little down climbing to get to the tree, but then after that you can rap down if you so choose.
    Sep 8, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    When you get to the top of the first pitch (past the bolts at the tree and up through the slot, to the perch behind the small tower); look right and you'll see a short hand/fist crack facing you in a dihedral.  It's not listed anywhere, but it takes pro well, is relatively clean, probably goes at 5.7, and also takes you to the summit via another interesting and wandering line.  Move your belay down below this crack onto a lower perch and try this crack.  It's a fun variation if you've already done the regular second pitch.    *But beware of the beachball-size boulder teetering on that perch. It's kinda wedged in, but it definitely wobbles and would wreak havoc on anything/anyone below.**

    Not a bad beginner route because it offers some nice variety. Usually I do it in two pitches with no problem. With a 60 meter it is easy to reach the notch belay without too much rope drag. From there it is a relatively short pitch to the top.    Note that the descent is not as trivial as the initial description would indicate. (Especially in the dark!) Do some route finding (trend north) and a few tricky downclimbing moves (no harder than 4th class or you are off route) and locate the rappel tree with anchor chains. Easy rappel to the ground from here and short walk back to the base.
    Jun 17, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Definitely not classic, but a fun multi-pitch route to take newer climbers up.  When I climbed it, instead of going strait up the groove, I opted for the spicier (5.7?) line that ascends the face directly right of the groove to the right of the true start to the West Face - this alternative doesn't protect as easily.  I broke the whole route into 3 pitches to try and avoid some of the apparently unavoidable rope drag.  The down-climbing to get off the top could be a little sketchy for a new climber or someone who is uncomfortable with exposure.  All in all a fun climb.

    To descend, walk north from the middle of the large level area on the north side of Castle Rock below the summit to third class terrain.  Find the slab gently downsloping to the east; at the edge of the cliff, find a vertical pinch about 20 inches high; if you look carefully, there is a gap behind it maybe 2 inches wide, just wide enough to fish a piece of webbing through.  This can be used as a rappel anchor.  From here, you can rappel directly to the eastern tree on the ledge about 60 feet below, or lower your partner(s) and downclimb.  Alternatively, downclimb the cliff and slab following the wall on your right, make a left turn around a 4 inch tree, downclimb five feet of vertical rock, and get to the middle tree on a large ledge with three large trees.  Proceed east along the ledge about 25 feet to the eastern most tree which has an old rusty rappel anchor chain around it (probably best to backup this chain with webbing).  Rappel 95 feet to easy walkoff terrain. Alternatively, you can end the rappel at about 70 feet, and then downcliimb the last 25 feet to easy walkoff terrain.   Have fun,  Tom Stocker  Aug. 4, 2008

    Climbed this route today, and we couldn't clean a cam on the 5.7+ variation of the first pitch.  It's an old school Wild Country Friend about a half inch in size.  It walked itself deep into a crack and over-cammed, I spent a half hour trying to get it then lowered my partner who also spent a half hour trying to clean it.  It's practically an antique and I doubt anyone would want to use it, but I'd appreciate it back.  As for the climb, it's not bad, quite a bit of loose rock though, and I would call the variation we did barely 5.6 not 5.7+.

    Not a great route but not a horrible one either. I personally feel like it would be a great beginner route. On the second pitch (relative I know) head up the wider crack with the choke stone and not the thin crack that goes straight up.    Also, from the notch above what is the obvious second pitch, it is possible to head up a couple chimneys and some random face moves to make the climb end on the summit proper. This is probably off route but it puts you on the summit as opposed to the traditional end of the route (a ledge short of the top).    A great night time climb, preferably when it's pouring rain.

    Deceptively hard for the rating.  In general it is no more than 5.2 or so, but there are some dicey moves on each pitch that raise the average rating to 5.5.  In particular, route finding off the first belay is interesting.  The protection is there, but it won't be real comforting for a beginning leader.  P3 features either an exposed, runout slab, a grunt chimney, or an interesting off-width.

    There is new 1/2" hardware on the bottom three pieces. This route is awesome now! It got cleaned up a bit and the old bolts (buttons) removed/replaced. THREE bomber bolts now lead to a few small pieces in the upper crack. Super safe and fun climb! PG-13 at worst and about mid-5.11! I'd give it 3 stars personally.

    I find that this climb is somewhere in the lower 5.11 grade. Way too much fun, but I jumped on it without any guide for a flash attempt and ended up projecting it, and it should have been well within my limits. Pro is very tricky. My blue TCU popped out. But overall, a very fun climb.

    Good line to practice clean aid (duh).  A camhook helps get through the crux about 15 feet up.  For a nice 2nd and 3rd pitch, you can link with the the first bit of the second pitch of Night Vision up to the two pitons and then follow up East Crack to a good belay, then fire for the summit.  I found a hook very useful on the 2nd pitch below the small roof.  C2, C2+ for the first pitch, C1-C2 for the rest.  No gear bigger than a #3 Camalot.

    After sending Gill Crack about a month ago, I thought 10d finger crack would not be such a big deal, but I was wrong. This route is HARD.  Crux is 12-15ft up, and feet are much less than desired.  Pro is not easy, but a lot of possibilities exist.

    Went here today to practice aid (nuts and cams only), and it was gorgeous.  Even though it was always in the shade, the bottom of the route was dry and I was fine with themals and a jacket.    Check it out if the warmth sticks around.

    The route is basically over after the first 18 feet, in fact there is a perfect no hands rest before the upper crux which isn't a give me, but you need to get past those initial 18 feet regardless, right Mr. Mills?
    Nov 18, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route does not lend well to larger hands...I have kind of a meat hook syndrome, so "tips" becomes very literal. My friend can lock into secure jams most of the time on this where as once I leave the ground I feel like I am twisting the hell out of my fingernails and getting no purchase whatsoever.    The route is essentially over once you are about 18 feet up in my opinion. There is FAN TASTIC climbing above, but compared to the section you've just forced your way up the top half seems 5.9-, even going straight up rather than bear-hugging with the right edge of Huston.

    Nice line.  This route seems to be finger width dependent.  Those folks with skinny fingers will find the jams solid and trustworthy.  The meatier-fingers might have a bit more trouble with them jams.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Easily one of my favorites. I've done this about four times now and don't see getting tired of it. The gear is great if you're good at placing it. I can sew it up and still have everything bigger than a blue Alien. I've never needed RPs on it and only use one medium to small nut. It works if you wait till after your fingers are done using the placements before stuffing gear in them. A good challenge for the grade. Doing the .10a thin crack up the face makes an excellent 2nd pitch.S

    First 15' is indeed pretty stiff for 10+, but maybe accurate if comparing to some polished pinscarred route in the Valley.  Was it Church Bowl Tree, Matt, the "valley's greasiest climb"?      Too chickenshit to lead, I toproped and placed gear.  Bomber and adequate gear can be found, but not so obvious.  Strong climbers at that grade should not have trouble placing appropriate gear.  excellent balancy fingercrack.  Someday i would like to combine with East Crack...
    Jul 21, 2003

    Agreed that the lower section is rather 11ish.  The pro is solid, although strenuous to place in spots.  And speaking from experience, a black Alien and a #2 RP will hold a fall here.

    Well, I haven't done a lot of hard granite crack climbing in the upper .10/.11 range, but compared to everything ELSE I've climbed in that range, this felt way harder than any .10d I've ever been on.  For that matter, it even felt harder than the .11's I've been on.  The start was pretty cruxy, but even more so was this funky section just after getting established with a piece after the start.  The jams were like flared slopers and the moves with the feet were strenuous, to say the least.  After that it seemed pretty straightforward until the top, which was the easiest of 3 cruxes to me.  Oh, and the gear is bomber if you place well, and are confident on smaller stuff like RPs.  Overall an excellent climb
    Jul 18, 2003

    The upper 10d crux felt much easier to me than the start. A previous comment said the bottom felt like 11 if the hand crack was avoided. I would agree with that statement.

    This was my first climb in boulder canyon and I felt it was one of the coolest finger cracks around.  the crux is full on tips jamming(possible 11a)and actually took good gear.  the falcon guide book gives it the "s" rating, which I totally diasagree with.  Great finger crack!!!
    Jun 27, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I know that the "crux" is almost certainly different during a lead, but for me (on toprope) the hardest moves felt like they were right at the top, where the crack became a little too narrow to jam.  The lower moves seemed pretty straightforward.
    Jan 1, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I would call this 11- the first 15 feet, if you stay out of the hand crack to the left.  Feet are tricky and and gear placement is strenuous.  Also, I thought the gear was was limited about 15 feet up, just before the climbing eases a bit, so be careful if you are pushing it.
    Jun 24, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    8/30/2001. An excellent line, although aided extensively by the notion of the pinscars on the route, which decreases the star rating I am sure. Be confident on hanging while scoping for gear on this one, or you may take those whippers on the small rp's. Sustained climbing with adequate protection. Before the final push place a small cam, or funky nut, as high as possible (by good laybacking fingers). This crack is very nice, with many great feet on the face, just look closely, and watch the polished crack with the feet a little dicey.... overall I would rate it 2 stars as well. Enjoyed..

    While some might think that is a bummer that someone removed a bolt, other people don't appreciate the retro-bolting of an existing line. Not sure who did it, but in my mind, the removal was justified by the line's previous history and such action should be more or less expected when someone plunks a bolt into a documenteed pre-existing line without some sort of consensus or agreement of the FA party.

    The first hanger is still MIA.  It is a bit strangely bolted, but I want to go back and do it to the top, on gear the whole way.      Or, I'm thinking it'd be a tough elmiminate to climb direclty up the bolt line, offrouting all the big stuff out R.

    I just climbed this on Sunday, not knowing what it was. I led it as one long pitch (160') to the top, veering right to join trad route with occasional fixed gear. I thought it was great and felt like 5.10. The first hanger was missing, but cams work just as well. I was drawn to the route more by the crack above the slung horn than by the bolted face. Going to the top makes this a great route rather than just another sport climb.
    Aug 17, 2004

    As of 8/12/03, the first hanger is missing.  The stud is sticking out about 1.5" so you can still loop a wired stopper on it.  Check the slings thoroughly before you rap;  They're looking a little tattered.  Good route!
    Aug 13, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I did this route a few years back, and I lead it again last night after it got retrobolted. I skipped the bolts this time.  Last night I continued up the crack past the anchor for quite some ways before moving slightly left and finishing the rest of the rock on the arete.  This is one long pitch.  Done this way the bolted section felt like 5.10a (it felt that way before it was bolted too), the moves for the next 15' are 5.8, and then there is a 5.10b crux above pro when the side-pulls and feet peter out at the same time.  From there the route gets more slabby (5.8?) for a while, with so-so pro.  When you encounter a broken area and some leaning flakes on the arete to the left, move onto the arete and charge for the top.  The arete here is nice and goes 5.9, VS if you are not skipping off to the sides at the final bulge.  If you don't liek the runout, you could move hard right at the final bulge and clip the fixed pins with long runners before pulling it there.  This is as for Northwest Corner.    Very nice.

    This route is the line of Brownies In  The Basin. This was first led by Rob  Candelaria back in the '70s. I led this  about ten years ago (at 5.9 X). Gear includes a couple RPs (did not have Aliens then), some ways below the crux. To my knowledge some others have led this too, including Chris Archer. No one has fessed up to this retro-bolting, anyone know who did this? Having said all this, it it certainly a more fun lead with the bolts, and I for one would not particularly like to see them removed. Maybe just for folks to check their guidebooks before drilling! Also watch out, my head got attacked by a falling Stopper while finishing this pitch. It may only have been a #12, but it sure felt like a #48. Painful!

    The move turning the overhang at the second bolt is the crux. I did a dyno to the good incut edge above the bolt, and I'm 6'1".  Shorter climbers may find this move more like 11a or 11b.    Above, steep but moderate (8 to 9) climbing leads to the anchor.

    Wow! This will be my first route comment. Not to say others I have climbed were less worthy, just that this was a pretty big lead for me.  A big confidence builder, and one hell of a good time! What a sweet line.    I gotta say though, I disagree about the "sketchy" gear. I have one word and I'll say it three times:  NUTs, nuts, nuts!  It's all I placed (besides the perfect black Alien) and the cracks ate them up like candy.  PERFECT, bomber placements. However, they are a bit "tricky" to place only because of the thin ass stances at which you must place them...you must be quick...decisive and keep moving, but it's all there.    Anyway, loved it. Gonna have to do it again, via Night Vision.
    May 24, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I didn't bring enough small gear for this route, so for me the protection was poor. But the corner at the beginning is definitely runout with injury fall potential. Also there is a loose rock at the top of the last pitch (end of the 5.7 crack) that could easily come out and cause trouble.
    Aug 16, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'll second (and third for that matter) the option to climb straight up off the belay (as for Night Vision) up the thin crack and traverse right underneath the roof and get back into East Crack after a few 5.8 moves.     I thought 5.10b was a pretty accurate difficulty rating for this climb considering I have bigger fingers but still really enjoy thin finger cracks. I stayed primarily in the crack and thought the gear was great and everywhere I needed it to be. However, if you're uncomfortable climbing above thin gear, this might not be the route for you. Beautiful climbing and a nice position.
    Jul 15, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I definitely agree with the above comments concerning sketchy gear.  the placements leading up to the crux are mediocre at best.  If you were to blow the crux move and zipper, good placements lower will definitely hold. It still makes for a spicy lead.  The climbing itself is great.
    Jun 14, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I placed two #3 stoppers, two green Aliens, and one blue Alien throughout the pitch above the roof. The gear is where it needs to be(kind of), although I found placing the gear very challenging and difficult.  Indeed, the crack gets progressively harder until the piton (the pin could be 4-6 feet lower in my opinion). The finger crack on the third pitch is worth the effort.
    Jul 20, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    As Chad's comment notes, it is easier to climb and protect this route by beginning left of the small dihedral.  From there I traversed under the step roof and pulled over on the right getting back in line with East Edge.  From there, instead of taking the pin-scarred crack, I climbed more or less straight up using a variety of cracks and edges.  Certainly this is the line of least resistance on the left side of Cob Rock but watch what you pull on up there as there are numerous loose flakes that are difficult to avoid and could do a lot of damage if they came off.

    The bolt that you saw is probably one of the bolts that got replaced on the second pitch of Night Vision (see comments there for details).

    Did somebody put a bolt on this thing...? Looked across today at it and it seemed like there was a new bolt below the fixed pin by 10 ft or so. Maybe a face variation, or from my perspective, it wasn't on the East Edge? I hope not! That route has great character and doesn't need anymore fixed gear on it.

    I led this route last week for the first time and really enjoyed it.We did the first pitch of Night Vision to start.I found the gear to be excellent and easy to place.  Really fun route and a good after work excursion.
    Aug 9, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    To me, it made more sense to climb straight up to the roof just left of the belay.  There is a thin crack system that offers plenty for small nuts.  Once reaching the roof travers a couple of feet to the right until you can reach the good horizontal crack above the roof.    I think this route can be sewn up with a set of RPs or micro stoppers.  I didn't place a single cam on the whole pitch.
    Jun 24, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There is a variation to this route, that I'm not sure has an established name or anything, but I'm sure it's been climbed before. Instead of starting up the left-facing corner into the overlap, it's possible to climb start about 6-8 ft. to the right. This leads up into incipient cracks with sparse pro above the overlap. Moves felt like hard .9 or easy .10, but it's been a while, so I'm not sure my memory serves correctly. Eventually, the pitch wanders up into easier, though steep ground with a nice crack and good pro. Pretty much the whole thing can be done in one long pitch. Once again, I'm not sure how much different this is from the East Crack described, but it seems to me that it's a different pitch altogether. Please anyone feel free to correct me or inform of the proper name for the climbing described.  One quick note on bees on Cob. I have been up there on a day when some people knocked off a sizeable nest and there were bees all over the place. Crawling on my legs as I led the second pitch of Empor! Just please be careful of those pesky bastards, they're everywhere anyways, we don't need to climb through angry swarms.
    Apr 11, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    It was probably 6 years ago when I did this, but I recall the runout moves are at the start before the roof, where it is only 5.8-9.  Another way to start this climb is the first pitch of Night Vision (10b, look for 2 bolts left of Huston's Crack).  This is much easier than the 10d thin crack right of Huston's Crack, and doesn't require big cams and grunting like Huston's Crack.

    Well, this time Charles and I disagree on the Protection.  Perhaps I was too tenuous to place, or perhaps it is my height, but I found myself struggling a bit for good gear on this route.  My partner, who is shorter than I agreed that the gear was difficult or lacking.  Then again, I normally climb in Eldo, not Boulder Canyon.    The moves are very cool, however, and very worthwhile.

    There is a new rappel route from the summit. It was installed to help mitigate the degradation of the standard walk off, which is in major disrepair. There are two chain anchors near the summit, basically between the top of Empor    and Northwest Corner . There is another rap station on a small ledge between those two routes for a second rappel. Two raps with one 60-meter rope gets you down.
    Aug 1, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If you're not good at fist and hand jamming, like me, that zig-zag crack at the top is pretty scary, but there is good pro (Camalots #1-3), and the fall would be pretty safe. It definitely earns the "+".    We soloed to the top of the start boulder and did the entire route in one long pitch with a 60m rope. I think it was close to all the rope though. A 70m rope would be more prudent for anchor building at the top. Rope drag wasn't really an issue, so if you're looking to get up and down quick, I'd say that's your best bet.

    Fantastic route!  Inadvertently combined pitches 1 and 2 but glad it worked out that way; don't think there's anything harder than 5.5 on P2.  The start of P1 is awesome; probably 5.9 and scary if you don't use the large boulder behind.  But either way, stay in the dihedral.  The moves in the corner, above the boulder, are fantastic and the gear is excellent!

    I loved this climb.  The photo here shows a climber skirting around obvious dihedral that I thought was 5.8+. The 1960's 5.7 rating is not accurate in my opinion, and the route is dangerous if you don't protect well at the beginning as the start is exposed and potentially dangerous landing terrain. It is NOT a place for beginning 5.7 leader. I don't know how this is 5.7 when the Bastille is 5.7 and the crux moves here are much more sustained. I started climbing in Eldo in 1968, and I know what 5.8 is and I know 5.9. This first pitch is closer to the latter than the former.

    Climbed it this morning, crossed the creek up stream 50 or so yards of the parking lot.

Tons of feet, nice jambs, eats up #1 and #2 BD cams.  3rd. weird positions but bomber jambs with good feet. I'd call it 5.7+, it eats gear too.    Cheers,    Prod.

    This was my first-ever rock climb back in 1959, and after probably another 5-6 times over the intervening years still remains my favorite Boulder Canyon climb. Very high quality rock, decent exposure, fine climbing with great pro---what more could a person ask?!

    I'd bring stuff to 3.5" if I were just leading at this level. Also, the creek is way down, easy to cross, but the downstream tyrolean is definitely in. Love the last 7+ handcrack variant, way better than the slot. There are three fixed pins in the first couple of pitches. The first one looks pretty good, the next two, not so much. We did the first two pitches as one, bring several slings for this.

    The line that this picture shows Ben taking, while being the route, is not the most obvious line to me.  I keep left, staying in the dihedral while working stems and great hand/finger jams.  Feels about 5.8, and superfun the whole way.  Protection is adequate (a bit tricky in the boulder cave though, so PG13.)  Climbing the first pitch this way ties with the 5.7 zigzag crack on P3 for quality of climbing.    I like to link P1-2 if I have a partner I'm confident can make it up without coaching.

    This is a fun route, the beginning is a little tricky, before you get to the ledge after the big boulder on the start, but I think most of the difficulties were in my head, as I am just starting to lead trad.  The rest of the route is pretty easy. Big gear is helpful; I remember using a #4 Friend somewhere on P1. There is a nice horn you can sling for a protection point on the 1st anchor at the start of the face crack (P2), also be careful setting up the anchors as I noticed some loose blocks up there.

    We did this one starting from the crack below the boulder.   We continued up the crack to the left from the top of the boulder.  This was the most exciting section, with a phantom alien in there just to mess with you.  It would make the route much more enjoyable if someone would go in there and pry that thing out.  (I may do that in a few weeks when I get back.  I though it was 5.9- for the "cave" section, but everywhere else was 5.7 or easier.

    Everyone climbs this one, and I see why, it's great. The start of it is a little tricky. Can also be done in one pitch 60m.

    Nice route, we did the first pitch from under the boulder, and there was maybe a move or 2 of 5.8 (but there is an easier variation to the right). I got to lead the last pitch which was really classic, good air, good gear, and good jams. Cruised it the whole time no problem, my buddy lead the Classic Dihedral at the Bucksnort Slab yesterday, and he thought this climb was quite a bit easier.

    I've only been leading this year and haven't lead anything harder than 5.9+.  Having said that, the first pitch was tricky for me, and I had to stem to the boulder; the pro wasn't abundant, and the edges below didn't look fun for a fall.  P2 seemed pretty straight forward, and I used plenty of stoppers for pro.  We combined P1 and P2.  P3 was a little tricky for me and there was plenty of exposure.  Here, I used mainly cams for pro, #3 being the biggest.  Overall, the climb was very cool, and I would recommend it!    Please note, I was here about a month or so ago and there was a tyrolean.  Today, it was gone which made the creek crossing interesting.

    The quickest way is to climb from next to the boulder, and link all the pitches finishing with the right angle crack in one long lead.  A 60m works fine.  Also, you can rappel from the 5.0 slot all the way to the ground by dropping right from the route.  This only takes one 60m rope, but make sure to tie the ends, you will be at them when you step off!  If you're worried about weather coming in, this is the quickest ascent (other than solo or simul).

    From reading the comments I guess we did the direct start. I remember it being harder than 5.7. We started parallel with the big boulder and there was a very airy move with no feet to get on the climb. Then on the second pitch there was a very difficult crack. I'm not a very good pure crack climber so I won't hazard a guess on the grade but I found it to be quite hard.     Otherwise its an excellent climb, just be confident at a few grades above 5.7 to lead this one.

    I climbed this a time ago, but just wanted to post that I felt as though the 7+ last pitch was harder than Northface left on Cob, and to me harder than Huston Crack.

    I lost a blue/gold Reverso at the base on 6/12/04.  If anyone would come across it, I'd offer up a beer or two.     Fun climb, last pitch a little scary for a beginning leader w/ zero crack climbing experience.

    I belayed a beginner leader on this yesterday (not his first lead, but close). He did the whole route in one pitch on a 60m rope, taking the easy version of pitch 3. He avoided rope drag by putting a piece off to the right where the route heads left up the slot.    Actually, Will just didn't know where he was supposed to belay, and kept going up to a few feet below the top. I made him come back down so I could lead the 5.7+ pitch 3. Not having a sufficently large cam made it feel a lot harder than 5.7. Basically, the stance sucked where I put in a cam to protect the crux moves. With a #3 camalot or equivalent it would have been a breeze (I think).    Great route. Great rock. Beautiful, solid granite. Reminds me of New Hampshire.

    A way to ease uncliping on the tree side is to clip a separate sling wherever you can when you get over and then step onto the sling to releave your weight off of the biner you're used to slide across.Another way to give newbies some added comfort is to give them an ascender (or two) and clip to the rope on a pulley rather than just hang on a biner, less friction.
    Jul 16, 2003

    One tyrolean trick is to not wear your pack, but to clip it to the rope and tether it to you with a sling. Thus you will be dragging it along. When you get to the other side, you will not have the added weight of the pack during the dismount.

    William:When doing a tyrolean with a heavy pack it helps to take the pack off your back, hang it on the line with a separate draw/carabiner and then put yourself on the line in front of it and tow the pack behind you using some long slings.

    Did this route the other day with a "newbie" leader. This one makes an EASY two pitch route. I started in the "cave" below the boulder, working the RF Dihedral/finger crack. A LOT of fun. Felt like a solid 5.8 start. The last pitch can feel a little sketchy (especially for new leaders). If you make the climb in 3 pitches, let them have the middle as a WONDERFUL beginner lead. Lots of fun on the Tyrolean as well. Thanks to whomever donated the rope (though the unclip on the southern side is a climb in itself...). Any ideas for awkward people with heavy gear aside from using the tree?
    Jul 16, 2003

    This climb can easily be done in one nice long pitch. We started on top of the boulder and took the 5.0 left-angling crack. Belayed on top in a handsized crack just down from the tree.mike.
    Jun 3, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    It's pretty easy to boulder up the outside (north side) of the giant boulder at the base of the route, and the tree that's up there is a good spot to belay from.  Pitch 2 would make a great first lead because there are lots of face holds, so you don't even need the crack for anything but putting in gear (really good gear too)).  If you have some crack skills (i.e. you know how to make a hand jam) the last pitch is kind of awkward, but very secure and takes good gear - it's nice to have camalots 1 and 2 ready when you need them.

    Climbed this route yesterday and had a great time, though we started a bit higher than I think we were supposed to on top of the biggest boulder that is at the start where 3 pitons are (2 broken heads, 1 still complete).  The dihedral below this boulder to the East seems like a better direct start.  I also wandered off towards the route labeled as "8" in the photo, does anyone know the name/rating on that?  When I got to the level of the "V" dihedral that heads to the "5.0" pitch I traversed across and finished off.  It was an interesting variation for sure.  Also, the top of the "5.0" section has a nice short crack that was good fun.

    My first climb ever in Boulder Canyon.  It was a blast. We started from the west side of the boulder, just before the West Cracks area.  I wasn't able to do it with the rack I was conned into carrying but it was a good alternative start.  The first pitch or two are vastly different than the last.  It is a sweet crack on the 5.7+ section.  A great move over the bulge that you really have to experience yourself.  It is also in the shade a good portion of the morning. I love this place.

    Did the "Tour de Cob" yesterday, including Empor. We did the direct, dihedral starting below the boulder and avoided heading right but continued up and belayed where the dihedral opens up to the V-slot. Then, instead of taking the V-slot or the 7+ crack, we did some thin cracks to the right of the 7+ crack that are connected by a couple horizontal cracks. Has anyone done these? I am curious as to what other's thought the ratings of this might be. I thought it was 9ish.
    Jun 18, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The first pitch seemed to be the most difficult of the three.  Not the best pro, not the best feet, not the best landing but the best climbing.  By the third pitch your in the zone and the traversing crack goes smooth, as long as you stay in it.
    May 17, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree, the direct start is the best way to start this climb.  I thought it was the best pitch.  The pictures below show a leader avoiding the corner, and thus IHMO, the best climbing on the route.  Stemming to the boulder would definitely drop the grade.  I'd say that it's solid 5.8 without the stem.  I thought it harder than the last pitch which seemed straight forward jamming to me.
    May 1, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a fun climb.  The 5.8 start straight up the corner feels stiff to me.  The feet are somewhat desperate but the hands/fingers are good.  I tried to do this without using the boulder at all but found it to be too difficult and yielded to the stem.    Also, it's about 100 ft. to the start of the left angling slot so I think this could be led as one pitch with thoughtful pro (and enough of it!).
    May 1, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Very nice route.. 3 stars indeed. We chose the direct approach up the dihedral and it didnt seem much harder than 5.7+/8 so a good choice, once you get that first piece. Also on P3 we took the choice of the line of 4 bolts to the left of the crack, anyone have any idea of what this goes at ? I was thinking somewhere in the range of 11b'ish ? A confirmation on that would be nice, as it is not to be found anywhere. Enjoyable climbing, great for intro leaders with tons of gear placements and great belay stances. A must do at Cob Rock.
    Aug 30, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree that the 5.7+ 3 pitch was harder than P1. But as Ben said, it is quite fun. The crack is pretty wide for most of the pitch and I placed my wide pieces up front, leaving me with a good run out. The jams are great though so it wasn't emotionally shattering, I think... :)
    Aug 28, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Great route, even if I did soak my butt (and gear) on the tyrolean. The last 5.7+ pitch was a bit challenging for me, particularly with a bag full of liquid chalk on my harness and wet, squishy shoes. The 5.8 dihedral start on the left and the 5.7+ crack above that seemed really easy compared to the last pitch. Cracks aren't my forte' though (yet).
    Aug 24, 2001

    A more interesting start is to climb in the dihedral from the very beginning and don't wander too the right right as shown in the photos.  The dihedral isn't that hard but I couldn't guess at the grade.  I was a 5.9 leader and it felt hardish to me.

    I think you may have been off route from the Empor for sure.  The direct 5.8 finish to the Empor is very obvious from the v-slot ramp. If you belayed after turning the corner left on the first pitch of the Empor, there would be a 12 foot crack running straight up. It then diagonals right for about 10 ft then heads up a smaller corner diagonal left. It is very straightforward. If my memory serves, you may have been on the face left of this crack. Not sure what that is. Either way. I wouldl go back and do the above finish :)  It is great climbing.
    Jul 24, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    So I'm not sure if I accidentally climbed this route - we were shooting for Empor, but rather than heading up left into the V-notch, I headed straight up a small crack, which ended with a loose hold in a crack next to a VERY thin horizontal crack below a blank face.   Rather than heading left, like this route seems to suggest, I headed right on the crazy-thin horizontal - basically toesmears on nothing, match on tiny crimper, and huge move right to a crimp on the far right end of the horizontal. Yellow TCU in the horizontal.  After getting up on the small ledge to the right of the  horizontal, a couple pieces up a short crack, and then another long traverse right. I ended up traversing out to the arete, to some jugs, but couldn't get any gear, and didn't want to run it out up the face, so I continued traversing around the arete to a head-sized pillar-flake, slinging that and finishing on the roof of Northwest Corner. It was probably a 30-ft unprotected traverse, which was really stupid, but I couldn't seem to figure out how to do anything else.  Is that this route, or did I do some strange new variation?

    The entire climb felt 5.11 as there are several cruxs throughout, especially at the start. The seam at the top might take 'small' RPs if I remember correctly (I seriously doubt it). This would be a bold lead as it probably would have to be climbed without gear, perhaps an awkward small cam placement periodically (again, I doubt it). Face Route makes for a fun late day adventure as it will leave you feeling complete and energized as it did me. Most of the moves involve balancy, intricate, and technical foot work on small insecure edges.

    For guys with big hands (i.e., can hand jam #3s) like myself, this route looks awfully hard from the ground, seeming to require super thin locks....    And well, it does, but it's shockingly easy given how small the finger locks are (I had five pinkie and ring-finger locks consecutively through the crux), part of this was due to the plethora of good footholds, but the jams themselves, while small, are shockingly secure, similar to the gear, which is small, but bomber.    Highly recommend this route, solid 10a, neither soft or sandbagged, and the upper section, which goes at 5.8-ish, is also quite fun.

Couldn't seem to get good feet...through in another #4, attempted next move and peeled. Stout f#cker! Managed to walk the #4 the remainder of the way and struggle ferociously to the topout. Definitely not a wind down kind of 5.8/9. Needless to say, agree with everyone's comments.... Fun. Indeed full on offwidth flare. Will make you sweat &amp; maybe resort to foul language as well.

    The new guidebook for Boulder Canyon (Wolverine Publishing) gives this a 5.9 rating, which I generally agree with.

    I found the knee jams on this one to allow for some rest breaks.  I walked a #4 Camalot up about 20 feet through the middle section of the crack.

    This is a classic, in part because of the great crack, but also because of the rating!  If this were done today, it would be listed at 5.9.  Back then, 5.10 was the hardest there was, so if you could climb it at all they gave it a 5.9, and if you did it first try it was listed at 5.8.

    I climbed this last month on a whim after getting done Empor.  I didn't have the requisite big cams and I ran it out on lead to groundfall potential at my leading ability (not good).  I walked a 3.5 Camalot up with me to about 1/2 way until it was too tipped out to function, then shot for the top.  Well, I didn't actually shoot for the top, more like oozed up the crack to the top, sometimes gaining 6 inches then losing 2.  At the crux I was fairly pumped, overgripping (oh feck, oh feck) and I ALMOST tried to face climb to the left to an inviting bolt I could fall from.  I'm glad I didn't, I probably would have peeled.

But I tell you my arms feel great today, guide book calls it an 8, but I have to disagree, and would bump it to a 9... I really like most cracks (and usually breeze up them) but I guess I have to learn a better technique for these off widths, I really wanted to do a toe-heal, but I wasnt finding the right place for that, and most of the way my hands just felt too small.

    This route makes for a great introduction to off-width cracks. It's a bit less than vertical and several hold outside and inside the crack make it a very worthwile TR.

    Yeah, this is a good route, fun and frustrating.  From the ground the rock around the wide part of the crack looks like there might actually be some good holds but the rock was pretty polished.  The leg jam was harsh.  I got stuck!!!

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I made the mistake of assuming the crux was in the thin crack section near the bottom and foolishly decided to tackle the wide section with no pro. Needless to say things got a bit desperate when I reached the crux and my last piece was 25 feet below me (clearly in decking territory)    The crux comes about 40 feet off the ground where the wide crack narrows enough to force your leg out of the offwidth jam. As stated by Ben, to pro this correctly, 2 number 4 Camalots would be needed (unless you care to walk one of them up with you).     All this being said, this is a fun route, sustained and technical.

    A #4 Camalot or equivalent is almost mandatory unless you run it out through the offwidth section. If you have two, you could really sew it up.

    I'm terrible at hand cracks, but this pitch felt easier than the top pitch of Empor for me. I'm giving it two stars for the varied moves (stemming, jamming, a little offwidth if you're feeling ballsy). Worth doing if you're in the area and the classics are taken, or as a warmup for Huston.

    Watched a few vids of this after completing yesterday. Looks like most people start higher on the arete than I. Starting left a bit lower adds an extra bump move before throwing to the lip (for a bit more of that "Hug" action).

    The slot that Crusher mentions takes a #3 BD stopper placed broadside out. The placement is solid and secure and provides protection while getting to the first bolt (this works because I fell and it held).     Going for the second bolt is another ball of wax. As mentioned in the above post-do not fall as one would hit the tree and possibly the ground. There are several ways of getting to the second bolt, both of which are 5.10 moves. Stated simply:  The crux of the first pitch is well above the first bolt but not quite at the second. The remaining pitches are fun.

    Love this climb. 1 pitch (60m) to top. Rack used on 6/2/07 in order:  clip the two bolts up to #3 (BD) cam @ overhang, #00 (WC) cam, to piton, clipped the two shiny bolts, then a #1 (WC) cam, and some pieces for the belay. 60m rope won't reach all the way to the belay tree on summit if done in single pitch.

    On 9/13/2005 Ron Olsen and I replaced the old 1/4" Rawl buttonhead bolts on the second pitch with 3/8" x2.25" stainless steel Rawl 5-piece bolts.  This work was sponsored by the American Safe Climbing Association.  They appreciate your support.    Bruce    ps - on the way down, I spotted two old 1/4" Rawl studs down and left and around the corner from the second pitch of Night Vision.  Both were next to an easily protectable crack.  Note, these were studs without either a hanger or a nut and were very poorly drilled.  Because of their location next to an easily protectable crack, the fact that they were very poorly drilled (sticking half out) and they did not have a hanger or nut attached to the studs, I removed them.

    I've always enjoyed this route. On pitch 1, before the first bolt, don't know about a #2 RP, but there is a shallow slot that takes a sideways #5 RP, the largest one they make, real well.     On pitch two the old (and very rusty) buttonheads are still there, as of August 2004. Used to be that this fine arete pitch seemed real safe compared to the funky crack/seam just right, but not anymore.     Note to self: Take a prybar and new bolts and drill next time.....

    The second bolt on P1 is poorly placed...if you fall before clipping it, there's a good chance you'll slam into the tree right behind you.    The bolts on P2 are old, will probably not hold a fall, and can not really be backed up with pro.  I ended up leaving the route and doing the crack which was at least something that can be protected.  I agree with the comment above...unless your confident in your 5.10 abilities for the day, don't try leading this.
    Jul 15, 2002

    Don't fall after the bolt either.  The two bolts on the second pitch are rusty 1/4" buttons that will as likely as not pop on a big fall.  The first bolt can be backed up about 4 feet to the right by small brass nuts.  The second bolt can not.    Beware: the leader on this pitch should be a solid 5.10 climber, as there is plenty of opportunity for injury in a fall.

    If you like climbing five fun cracks, then this climb is for you! We broke up the route into three pitches to make sure my second could hear me a little better in the canyon. The hand jams are bomber, and the crack just keeps going and going and going with great gear throughout. The belay shown in the book sure does look questionable to me as stated by others. It's a huge, detached flake resting on the ledge. Looked a little sketchy to me, so I decided to setup the belay directly below the start of the 2nd pitch of Empor which created rope drag. This was an amazing route I'd climb again - must do for sure!
    May 29, 2016
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This has been brought up in previous comments, but I just wanted to reiterate. Be very cautious around the flake/block on the small belay ledge for pitch 1!!     Before I realized how detached it was, I had placed a cam in the crack created by the block and the face. Tugged on the gear slightly to test and the whole block shifted, not a ton but enough that I nearly crapped my pants. Yikes! So just a word of warning to anyone getting on the route for the first time. From below, everything looks solid and ready to accept gear. Don't be fooled like I was!    Also, in my opinion, this makes the ledge nonviable as a belay per the route description. I ended up climbing around the block and building an anchor at the base of pitch two (see pic), which caused a lot of rope drag.     Otherwise this was a really fun, quality route. Have fun out there!

    Good first multi-pitch trad climb. As of February 2015, there are still many fixed nuts and cams throughout the route. The V-slot exit to the left is quite easy for the first part (5.2) but has 15 feet or so of steeper crack climbing at the end (5.7).

    Excellent climb. First pitch is sustained fun. Second is awesome, but I was very scared. I recommend doubles in larger cams (#2BD, I think) for the zig-zag...that or fiddle with hexes (blah). I didn't have cams and felt pure terror as I dashed for the top. Also, confidence with hand and fist jams is a plus. This was harder than 5.7 for me.    I don't recommend doing it in one pitch -- starting up the zig-zag with rope drag would be a...drag.

    Next time I climb this I'm going to bring a 70 meter rope and make it one, long, mind-blowing pitch of 5.7.  It might even be possible with a 60 meter especially if you are comfortable with a few moves of simul-climbing.

    This is a fantastic route with some exposure, long (sustained) climbing, and quality rock!    Don't be fooled by the grade; it makes you earn a 5.7. The crux for me on the second pitch was quite dicey as the feet seemed mediocre. Once I committed, the moves went cleanly.    Have fun.

Pitch two was up and onto the arete, belayed at the top of the arete.  Pitch three (short) was up the crack 8' left of the bolt line.  Done this way, I found the crux to be on pitch two, moving into the flared wide crack just above a piton with mediocre feet and non-positive hands.

    Climbed this line today, starting around 2 pm. Getting a little cold on the north face. The whole formation was in the shade when we showed up. Great route, three stars.

    A fine route! A couple 5.7 moves with great rests. Gear: I didnt use anything larger than a 2 camalot (save for one #10 hex). Theres a great exposed belay on the arete at the top of pitch one (dont go into v-slot). This eases rope drag and allows you to see your partner, and theres no belay difficulties if parties are on empor (always). if you opt for the original finish instead of empor finish, you can: climb the exposed arete just above this belay, or jump into the easy corner. at the top of the corner, finish with a short finger crack (about 8 feet left of the bolt line).

    Pitch 1 was excellent, however, some idiots decided to jump on the belay ledge with me as my partner was on his way up pitch 2.  Personally, I would have stopped about 15' feet below to build my anchor on the larger ledge if I saw another party up there.  I ran into quite a bit of loose rock (big ones) on pitch 2.  All in all, a great climb.  Great views of the canyon and surrounding rock.
    May 28, 2002

    Great climb.  I'd give this 3 stars and go as far as suggesting that it's a better line than Empor.  The entire climb follows a broken crack system making this one of the longer (and probably best) 5.7 cracks in BC.  Perfect jams are available for almost the entire route (assuming you do the 7+ finish).  The first pitch is a nice warm up with a few 5.7 moves.  The second pitch is more sustained with great pro the whole way up.  Watch out for parties on Empor, though, as you might have to wait for them to pass(as we did).
    May 8, 2002

    Climbed this again yesterday.  Combined with the last Empor pitch I think it's easily 3 stars.  The first pitch has a few .7 moves but is mostly 5.6, I think.  Great apres-work climb as the approach takes about 1.5 minutes.  Fun beginner lead.
    May 1, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The first pitch is a nice, long, sustained 5.7 with lot's of gear opportunities. The second pitch intersects with Empor and can cause some belaying difficulty if the 5.7+ finish is selected since you have to climb down slightly from the belay before heading to the top.

    Did this earlier this morning.  I don't like it when my holds all feel like they'll fail.  Not to spew beta, but I got a bomber #4 Smiley wedge in at the left end of the traverse behind the big flake.  It didn't LOOK bomber, but would have held a fall, especially since I just wanted it while I moved up to the pin.  In the undercling above the pin I got a really good green alien, and then I slung the super creaky flake.  I don't think the slung flake would have held a fall, but it was easy to the ledge after that.    If you like climbing on peeling onions you'll like this climb.  The moves are spectacular, and the pro reminds me of Eldo, but everything is hollow and flexing.  For an awesome finish go straight up the crack in the middle of the tower without steping around the corner to the right.
    Jul 18, 2003

    This route has a couple creaky flakes on it.  I ran it out across the traverse only to discover that my placements would have to go behind flexing flakes.  That old pin after the traverse looks pretty good at that moment!  A great route.

    I climbed at Cob yesterday, did NF center and Northwest Corner and used the new raps.  I think the location of the lower station changes the character of the slight runout section on the Northwest Corner.  You can now clip the bolted anchor instead of trusting the "seemingly" bomber sideways placed nut backed up by a green Alien below. I have never taken the fall on that gear, but over the years I have stood on the ledge having to muster the courage to cast off into the territory above.  I did not clip the bolted station for pro, but it seems like future climbers will be having a different experience on the route if they do use it.     I also think the location of the rappel line will create problems for climbers doing the Northwest Corner as other parties rap down, as it did with only two parties on Cob on Friday.  I can appreciate the efforts of wanting to minimize erosion, but walking down from the summit takes anywhere from 5-10 minutes.  Perhaps the trail could be improved, or the location of this rappel line can be moved further right, to routes that get much less traffic than Northwest Corner.  I have enjoyed climbing the historic routes like North Face Left, North Face Center, Empor, and Northwest Corner over the years with no bolts or fixed stations, only ancient pitons, marveling at the skill of those early ascensionists.  This is an experience that is disappearing in Boulder Canyon with this small section of Cob Rock as one of the last holdouts.      Installing the rap route was probably not done with the intention of altering the experience on this route, but in my opinion it has.
    Aug 3, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There is a new rappel route from the summit. It was installed to help mitigate the degradation of the standard walk off, which is in major disrepair. There are two chain anchors near the summit, basically between the top of Empor and Northwest Corner. There is another rap station on a small ledge between those two routes for a second rappel. Two raps with one 60-meter rope gets you down.

    Rated this PG. If you're solid at the grade, the face is no big deal, but a fall there would be fairly long and very painful considering the ledgy nature of the rock. Heads up to the fledgling 5.8 leader.    Nice varied climbing on a cool chunk of rock. I do it as one pitch, usually w/ the direct start, and with long runners in the right spots there isn't much rope drag (70m rope).

    This is a really fun route with lots of variety. The face sections are a bit run out, but the features are solid, so there's very little risk of taking a big whipper.     We climbed this in one pitch with a 70 meter rope. I ran out of alpine draws along the way, so the rope drag got pretty bad. If you link both pitches, make sure you have a bunch of extendable draws with you.

    We started around the right of the arete at the base, going up a face with a crack that took a blue TCU.  A slightly spicy start (not sure what this route is part of) but a fun alternative to the standard start.

    An alternative start to the route is to climb down under the big boulder and climb the shallow dihedral (5.8) just to the left of the route. This is also an alternate start to Empor. There are some fun moves on this and good pro. Be careful if you climb down from the west side of the boulder as the landing is a little nasty.    You can bypass the runout face on this route by going a few feet right into a flaring corner with an old pin (probably Layton's!). The moves are harder (5.9ish), but the pro is decent.

    What a fantastic mental focus problem. Those face moves are pretty easy, but blowing it would be extremely unpleasant, wouldn't it? I found myself standing there for several minutes, irrationally waiting for the traffic noise to die down a bit, consequently exhausting my feet. After a short retreat I pulled thru it without difficulty. After the face I apparently got off-route, moving left into a short dihedral, under the roof, then traversing left on a neat hand crack, finally pulling up and over on a system just to the right of the top of Empor. There was a bit of lichen, but a fair amount of chalk, too.  Is there a route between Empor and NW corner? I also did the whole thing in one pitch, and I didn't find the drag to be too terrible.

    Definitely a fun route, spicier than others on [Cob Rock] with that face section.  We should all give thanks to Layton for putting this up back in the day, imagine how hard and sketchy that first lead musta been in 59!!!!!

    If you start just below and to the right of the large boulder, there is a nice finger crack.  I think that some of the guidebooks call it Northwest Corner Direct and give it a 10a rating.  The hands are good but the feet are thin.  The crack is easily protected with some smaller stoppers, you can even place one about ten feet up by getting on the boulder to the right.  I know how many feel about pre-placing gear, but it protects you from a potentially painful fall into the cave below.  A great variation to a wonderful climb.  -BPC

    FWIW, I also found the face above the crack to be "exciting".  I certainly didn't feel like I was sewing it up.  The most reasonable explanation is that I probably missed the gear to which Myke refers.
    Aug 30, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    well, let's see.  I climbed the crack to the right of the tree/bush with great jams and pro, then found myself standing on top of a small triangle/shelf before the face propper.  There was a GREAT horizontal stopper placement at hip or lower (can't rememmber) - prob the one you speak of.  Then I hit the face and moved straight up and then right to the arete where the small roof/left leaning crack is...I certainly felt the exposure with the rope 15' below me on that stopper!  But I am a coward so that was pretty exciting.  Maybe the route to the arete was my problem - looked cool/was cool - maybe better pro further up instead of right to the arete?
    Aug 30, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I think you mean the second pitch?  That's the only place where I couldn't sew it up at will...    At the top/end of that shallow V-dihedral (where the face climbing starts) there was a great stance just left of it on a ledge.  I was able to place a #3 stopper (or close) in a little notch (horizontal placement)- it made me feel a lot better than doing the moves with the .75 camalot 10 feet below.

    After reading Michael's comments this morning, I KNEW which route I had to do today.

Yup, and I have to agree, turning the roof is pretty dang sweet.  Took me a couple of minutes to figure it out, but not that bad once you figure it out.      I think you can probably lead this route with just stoppers, hexes, and draws... I rarely had to use cams, and even then it wasn't mandatory.  Fun!

    There are two pitons at the "top" of this climb...about 25' above where the crack ends.  I backed them up with two small cams, brought up my second, and then we rapped from there.  Currently there is a decent looking red sling with rap biner through the pitons.      This is actually a sweet little climb.  Short but worthwhile.  The start might be a tad bit dicey if you aren't comfortable at the grade, it protects with small cams/stoppers.  After that, you can sew the climb up, and it is easy to protect the roof moves. Save a few mid-sized cams (#1, #2 BD Camalots) for the crack after the roof. Make sure to put long runners on pro directly below the roof.

    Definitely 5.6.  The offwidth sections don't take #3 Camalots (didn't bring any 4s, but those should work).  But, there's a hand crack to the right that does take normal gear (probably 5.6 also).  Slap some gear in that crack, climb down a bit, and practice those arm bars!  From the top, follow a very loose path up to the left and rap from a tree.  Leave a TR anchor and do the dirty, parallel finger cracks that follow the rap line (5.10?).

    An excellent alternative is to stick to the fist crack that wraps around to the right and then up. This gets you behind this small buttress eventually and at the start of West Dihedral. This crack is more of a big flake at one point and kind of spits you out to the right with bad feet for a 5.9ish move. Plug a good cam and commit to the jams and you get above to good holds. Keep on up and end up on a large ledge below the roof with a bolted route on the right. Either add a pitch up the offwidth dihedral to the left and join Northwest Corner or traverse on easy ground at the ledge level and walk off. Place gear on the traverse or not.

    Don't let two stars and lack of comments stop you from doing this route; it's a great little after work jaunt and is sheltered from the noise of the creek. The only reason this route doesn't get a third star is because it's short.    It protects well, has everything from stemming to jamming to lie backing, and has a great little roof problem to finish it off. Really enjoyed this one and am tempted to give it 3 stars. Bring a second #2 and a #3 to really sew it up. Save one small piece (I used a #1 Metolius) to back up the two pins, but they'll likely hold a short fall.
    Aug 19, 2014

    I found the Boulder Canyon guidebook's sparse beta to be a little unhelpful.  This route is the big, orange, semi-overhanging corner that starts from a big ledge (you could park a Volkswagon there) above the descent path.  About 15-20' of 5.3ish climbing is required to gain the ledge; recommended that you either solo this part to prevent rope drag or have your belayer join you on the ledge.      Climb the big, orange corner toward the left side of the roof (fun!); look out to your left, and when you see a flat-topped pillar (shortly before climbing into the roof), you can traverse left about 10 feet (stepping over a void on good foot ledges) and belay from that pillar to end a first pitch (there is a fixed pin there).  If you climb too high and miss the pillar, you might as well just keep going and link the two pitches indicated by the guidebook---the little left side of the roof looks intimidating but definitely goes at a very reasonable 5.8, and the second pitch is very short.

From here go R into a R facing corner with a short offwidth.  Use a #5 Camalot to start and a #4 1/2 Camalot at the crux.  Muscle up.  Find a green Alien placement where you move up and left, and join the Northwest Corner.

    A bit soft for the grade but a fun route on big holds with a boulder problem to get you well pumped at the finish.

    This is a nice TR after climbing Joy Ride. The climbing after the crux is great and maybe 11+. However, the crux (pulling over the roof and the next few moves) seemed absolutely desperate. Did some holds break? The right of the two crimps looked as if there could have been some recent breakage. To me, it seemed like there was no way that it was only 5.12, but maybe I'm just baffled by another weird Boulder Canyon crux. Anyway, it's a fun TR if you skip those crux moves. Several of the bolts were spinning, so we tightened them up with a small wrench.

    Thanks for the response, Jeff. Some routes that are pretty bad:    Both routes on the Upper Bowling Alley wall, especially the right one (as noted by yourself).    A few natural but very lame 5.10-ish routes at the Sport Park.    Most of the easier climbs at Sherwood Forest (apologies to Richard Wright).    That's what I can think of in the 5.10 range in Boulder Canyon. Obviously this is my opinion and doesn't imply that others might not enjoy these climbs. I don't have any real fondness for Fly Swatter, but it fits in with the nature of the cliff which is short and sharp. For me, a real sport climbing bomb has got to include most of the following: clear disregard for any later climber's safety, including loose rock, poor protection (location, quantity, and quality), and bad anchors (quality and location). Clear disregard for surroundings, including contrived or squeezed line, dangerous base, and proximity to highway. Clear disregard for aesthetics, including poor rock, lots of vegetation and lichen, cleaning scars, lots of glue, chipped holds, constantly wet rock, generic or wandering line, big jagged features, and awkward climbing. Now a lot of classic trad climbs include many of these things as part of the experience so I'm restricting this to sport climbing. And it's true that Fly Swatter has vegetation, screwy protection, and a bit of lichen. However, it also has a striking, uncontrived line, pretty good rock, and interesting climbing. I might give it a star at most, but it doesn't seem worth a bomb. A true bomb has to, in its own way be as special as a 5-star classic and just as rare.

    Fly Swatter is worth a star at least. It is fun. Technically  easy, but kinda pumpy for being just vertical. Good  warm-up. The 5.11a referrred to is of course The Bait.

    Awesome route that is often overlooked. Fun moves down low to really good granite face/slab climbing up top. Not a route where you're gonna get pumped, but I found that you had to be dialed on the moves up high with some precision footwork throughout the crux.

    Seems some people take .12d here on MP, and .13a on their 8a scorecard...hmmmm.  I generally don't like these finicky kind of routes, but this is one of the better routes in BoCan.  The handholds are quite good, but my left big toe got really pumped. I'm going with solid 12d or soft 13a...but I'm takin' 12d on the scorecard ;-)

    Hi....about the bolts, there seems to be some questions...I first did the route with three bolts on the top half, but after a few people commented about hitting the ledge, I returned and add the one you clip from the undercling, before stepping left and reaching for the big undercling crack...I must admit, it was a bit scary, so thanks to those and their suggestion which made the route a nicer climb!

    Thanks Bob, it is a terrific route!  I agree that 4 bolts adequately protect the crux top half.  Both guidebooks only show 3 bolts above the halfway point ledge and 3 below.  Removing any of the 4 headwall bolts and reducing the total to 3 would result in potential ledge falls, and would be out of character with the rest of the route.  I think that a bolt up high was missed in the initial count.  Mark told me that he has not been on the route, so that may account for the error in his guide.  In any case, the bolt number is 7, and they are well placed.  All clips are from good holds.  The difference in doing the route with the draws in place or hanging them seemed negligible.  Kudos to Jesse for a Boulder Canyon classic.

    Chris, the upper four bolts just about have to be original, otherwise there would be bad ju-ju up there. The lower three are similar, though I can see that  the first bolt could have been dispensed with by using natural gear (which we all placed before that bolt anyway).    Glad to see that you and Henry sent this puppy. Pretty fun, huh. :-)    Cheers,bobl

    Where were the bolts when you led it, Peter? there are now 3 bolts below the ledge and 4 bolts protecting the headwall/ crux.  They all seem to be the same vintage.

    That's funny about the bolt count. Are there actually seven? Both Rossiter's and Rolofson's book count six bolts. Was there a bolt added by someone?

    One last note: there are 7 bolts.
    Jul 8, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Fabulous pitch.  1-2 cams in the hand sized range (2-3 size friends) protect the stretch to the first bolt after that the bolts are sufficient.  The upper half of the route involves 3 short boulder problems separated by good holds with a rising pump.
    Jul 8, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A note on the gear. You need trad gear for most of the lower corner, which is more awkward than its 5.10 rating might suggest. There is also an opportunity to get something in just below the start of the crux. Get established on the ledge and comfortably clipped in. You can move a right for a short space on some good, horrizontal finger slots. Here you can get some thin gear in, but we are talking about Sliders, LowBalls, or small TCUs. This will get you to the next bolt. After that, just hang on to the good hands and hope that the feet find some adhesion. You won't find a place to stop after that, even if you wanted more gear. However, the upper section is well bolted and so clean that a fall catches only clean air.  Watch the gear placed below the crux, these slots are keepers, and its easy to wanker in the thin stuff so you can't get it out. This route is cool, super cool.

    A wonderful route and easy to access. Paired with late afternoon shade, it's a good choice for an after-work climb. I brought a small cam for the top (red or green C3) that took the sting out of the mantel move to the chains. Not a hard move, but your last bolt is down and around a somewhat sharp corner. You might think of bringing another small cam for before the first bolt, or stick clipping it as I myself dd.

    Sorry but I feel compelled to speak up on this subject. No disrespect to anyone is intended. In fact this comment is all about respect. Adding bolts to some elses's route to make it less scary or  convenient without getting permission from the FA'ers is bad style and disrespectful. PERIOD....    With the advent of sport grid bolting in Boulder Canyon, I can understand how this ethic is being lost or not understood by newer generations of climbers. In fact, it might not be understood by some in the older generations, but we should all respect others creations and routes that require mental as well as physical stamina in climbing.

    First, a route is not harder because it has less protection. It is scarier and deserves more of a PG-13 or R rating, but harder is not what it would be, in my opinion. Also, Coney Island may have begun as a mixed crag, but it's a full on sport crag now with draws on most of the climbs. I think bolting a bolt on Give A Dog A Bone so you don't have to bring up a Cam is totally fine and not in bad style or form. That being said, I did not bolt the route and thank Jessie A TON for putting it up! Sick lines all of these.    On the last guy that posted, the crux is definitely in the 12b range, no harder. The Pursuit of Frappiness has a crux that is similar in difficulty on Avalon. It takes some getting used to, but if you get the right beta, it's all about trusting the feet and working them up! If you want any beta on the route or anything, just e-mail me or ask! Good luck up there!

    This route is way hard for me. Usually I can do 12b in a day yet I've worked this route probably four days and have yet to do the crux. I would argue that Lucid Dreaming and amazing face both classic 12+ have an easier crux than this, but maybe I just have shitty footwork. Nonetheless, this climb is fantastic and a must do for Boulder Canyon.

    I found this route much easier than 'The Ticket', both similar with breaks, I am tall though....    A cam is nice before the first roof to assure the clip, we had nuts, but a #2 BD or small cam would fit in the area, several options. The fall how be it slight, might not be fun.    ...Jesse's comment is funny, is a route grade harder because it has less protection?

    Great route.  Several moves where height helps a lot, including the bottom roof, a reachy move in the technical face climbing, and the final crux after the rest.  Be sure to unclip the top draw if toproping.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Great route. Climbs the steep face on upper Coney Island just to the left of Der LetzeZug. This route is pretty sustained once you leave the ground. There is a burly move pulling the small roof around the second bolt with some continuous in-your-face near vertical, tech slab climbing with some nice, small crimps.  About 3/4 of the way up is a flat ledge where you can get a no hands rest (take it cause you will need it) for the second distinct crux just after the rest. Awesome route, one of the better 12b's in the Canyon. Significantly easier than its neighbor. You may want to stick clip the first bolt or place a small cam in the crack given that it's fairly high on a technical slab.

    Great route, truly.  Not sure what the latest is on it though....  We did it today and found that it's a 2 pitcher, great warmup staying in the 5.9 grade.  Linking both pitches requires a 70m rope to get down in one lower, or else rap it.  Draw count = 11 bolts (+2 for the anchors).

    I didn't like the location of the 4th. bolt. A fall from here prior to clipping the bolt  would give you a pine tree enema. The bottom section is way grungy, but climbing over the top 4 bolts was very good.
    Mar 26, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Wow...much harder (for me) than Runaway!  Kind of a weird bouldery start w/ most of the holds seeming to go the wrong way.  Lower section was OK, but the upper section (from the big ledge) was really quite cool.  The bolts are quite well placed in my opinion...thankfully- as I tested the one at the top of the headwall. Didn't manage to get it clean (this time) and couldn't figure out the moves to get off the last ledge...had to cheat here as I was out of juice.  We'll be back so I can work through this one and get it clean.  A word of advice- I think that longer draws (like 17cm-20+cm) on the 4th and 5th (&amp; possibly 6th) bolts would help reduce some of the rope drag I experienced. (as opposed to the 12cm draws I used throughout)

    Probably the best overhanging 5.9 in Boulder Canyon. Fun and pretty clean now, I didn't kick off any choss on the lower section. Finding it's a little bit of a chore though. Just keep going around to the right side of the area.

    The upper section of this climb is a lot of fun, but the bottom part (which is shared with Pri-Moe) is not. There is at least one handhold (which is probably used by most people to clip from) on the lower part that won't be there for long. Be wary of the rock on the lower part.
    Jul 2, 2004

    This route is on the far right side of Upper Coney Island. The upper half of this route is enjoyable and climbs intimidatingly steep rock on a series of amazing jugs that if they were at the Sport Park you'd think were manufactured.  The lower half seemed rather dirty, uninspiring, and, at one point, somewhat runout.
    Jun 23, 2004

    What a fun route!  This website rocks!  I would put in my own 2 cents regarding finding the climb, take the right fork, go past Lower Coney Island.  Upper Coney Island is now above you.  One could reasonably argue that this climb is on Upper Coney Island, just split from the main face by an upward traversing gully reminiscent of the ramp on Bell Buttress up to Cosmosis.  To find No Name, basically just catch up with the Upper Coney trail after passing Lower, keep going right, staying close to the wall, the wall and trail will pass a low point and then turn left and head uphill to the north, finding the climbs shortly.  We did the "down grassy" slope and ended up in Road Bomb City poking around the top of a roadcut cliff. To be avoided.

    A steep, exciting and fun route.  The crux headwall is height-dependent and may be harder than 5.9 for shorter climbers.  I'm 6'2", and was just able to reach a key handhold to pull myself onto the ledge atop the headwall.    A note on the approach:  this climb and Pri-Moe are on a crag about 100 yards right of Lower Coney Island.From Lower Coney Island,  head right and follow a path that traverses a grassy hillside to the crag, then head around the right side and up the hill a bit until you see the bolts.    Steep, exciting and fun.    Crux is height-dependent; probably harder than 5.9 for shorter climbers.

    There is mass quantities of lichen everywhere, and crumbling holds through the crux. I personally felt this climb's crux was incredibly forced.  The climb would be much more independent if it just went up the right ramp a couple more feet.  You could skip the crux and then have good 5.10.      FYI beware of the loose blocks on the start of the climb. Although not massive, they definitely could end your partner's climbing day.

    Don't let the negative comments put you off. My partner and I both led this and thought it was well- protected and very fun. Perhaps it has just cleaned up a lot.     May 2015 addition: I've done this twice now, and I think it's nearly a 3-star route. Yes, it has some suspect rock entering the crux (don't place gear in the loose, thin crack/pillar thing below the bolt...you can get a bomber #3 Camalot in the slot under the bulge just below this). Most of the route is reasonably clean, and the climbing is varied and fun.

    Once this cleans up a bit more, I think it deserves a star (or at least not a bomb). There are some cool moves up the crack and through the slot. Heed Chris' advice about gear in the loose flake before the 4th bolt. If you have a #3.5 Camalot or so, though, it provides bomber pro right below the loose flake. In retrospect, the move up to clip the 4th bolt wasn't bad, but I'm glad I had some gear.

    For many years, Bob has done an awesome job in opening numerous routes of all grades in the area.  Unfortunately they can't all be gems, and IMHO this one falls into that category.  After being bombarded with a steady stream of lichen, dirt, pebbles, and assorted other detritus, I got the coveted "second refused to follow! (or lead)."  Maybe this route will clean up after significant traffic, but at present it is quite dirty.  Some other minor points: the 4th bolt is placed too high to be clipped before beginning the crux stemming, necessitating small gear in a loose flake.  Lowering the bolt would adequately protect the moves into the finger crack without having to risk ripping the gear in the movable flake.  Also I'd agree with Kent's comment regarding the rack, in addition to small to finger-sized cams, I also placed #2, 2.5 and 3 Friends.  Finally, why are the anchor bolts 4.5 feet apart from each other?!  Is there another route planned beneath the leftmost of the bolts?

    Make sure you bring Friends up to #3.  This is not a sport route. It is well worth doing, but watch out for the loose block.

    Thought this would be a good warm up before getting on the harder sport but ended up taking some whips and having to back off.  The Bocan 2nd edition also seems to have the topo wrong for this route.  However I didn't know and started left in the short dihedral to a ledge and then up into the right-facing corners/roofs.  I was shut down working into the corner beneath the large roof.  This way may go but not at the grade (10c), and the gear would not be plentiful though a 0.3 I placed kept me off the ground a few times.

    A friend and I did this in '96 following the topo shown in the current and last guidebooks. He thought it was solid 5.11 or harder and wound up taking a nasty fall at that roof/protrusion about mid-way up... the rock was a little scaly and the lower half that he climbed didn't appear to have been climbed much. Interestingly, the 1999 Rossiter Boulder Canyon guidebook topo shows "11" at one point in this left start, even though the route is supposedly 5.10c.    We later checked in with Dan Hare, and Dan mentioned that the route actually started in from the right as for Coney Island, and that the guidebook topo was wrong. We came back in 2006 and started on Coney then traversed left (as shown in the photo above), and it felt about 5.10d or 11a that way and adequately protected. Maybe that left start shown in the guidebooks is waiting for a first ascent, though seems likely someone has done it that way by now?

    I'd like to hear more about the starts to this route. We started on the left, under the obvious small roofs, and got totally shut down trying to move up under the bigger roof, about 30 feet above the starting ledge. Poor hand holds and no feet...it seemed a lot harder than 5.10. Can someone who has successfully climbed it this way comment? Has anything broken, or am I just weaker than I thought?

    Fun, not the most obvious moves near the top off the ledge...difficult O/S lead for me (for what that's worth).

Did it again on TR to pull the rope...MUCH easier and more enjoyable the 2nd time.  I'm confident that when we get back up there it'll be a much easier lead.

    Climbed this today after waiting for the snow to melt off the approach. Definitely worth a visit. There are many thought provoking sequences separated by good rests.

I had to park in the small pull-off that serves as the entrance to the parking/picnic area because the road down to the river was closed off with an orange fence.

    A silk purse from a sow's ear, Runaway is amazingly good given the nondescript terrain it covers.

Note to "but there's gear" activists: this route would *never* have been done ground up trad (not because it isn't possible, but because death blocks and moss aren't appealing).

    Climbed this route tonight.  Long pitch, lots of easy climbing on good positive edges.  But not sustained at the grade, one (8) move IMO.  I placed a blue Alien above what I thought might be the crux move.  Did throw a #2 Camalot high in the crack in the last 10'.  FWIW, I would feel comfortable leading this trad with small wires and Aliens, and a #2, but I have no problem with the bolts, as I clipped them tonight.  Without clipping bolts, this climb would be interesting for the grade.  Will go back in daylight sometime to do just that.... One note...the breadbox-sized block 20' off the ground moved when I touched it, and if not removed, might injure or kill someone sooner or later....
    Oct 7, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I looked at the photo and thought, "This is a trad climb!" So today I checked it out on self-belay. The bolts were useful...to find the start of the climb, to know when to leave the main crack system, and to rap from. Other than that the gear was straightforward except when first leaving the main crack. There, the first piece was trick, and the next piece was a fair microcam with optional long sling over horn backup. After that the gear is again straightforward.    The "this crag is all sport" excuse won't work, since there are, counting from Rolofson's version 1 guide, 5 all trad routes plus 1 variation here, plus there are 2 mixed bolt/gear routes, The Bait and Pri-Moe. The "needed cleaning" excuse won't work I think, since the FA party recommended bringing some trad gear (and so why not all trad?), and the cracks don't look like they were significantly cleaned.    As for quality, ignoring the sport vs trad issue and assuming this cleans up some, I still don't get the 3-star talk. I think it's a 1-star compared to other 2-star trad and sport climbs in this grade on this site.    As for difficulty - much easier than many Eldo 8s, and way easier than the Cozyhang (an alleged 7). Can't say relative to the 8 sport routes. Maybe comparable, but I can't remember the ones I've done so well.    If you're going to do this trad, bring nuts from big brass to about 3/4". Cams from micro to #2 Camalot with doubles from about 1" up. About 18-20 slings, including 5 or more full length, since you'll probably be using more pieces of gear than there are bolts. If you're a beginning trad climber, consider bringing a rack and clipping every other bolt.    The soil at the base is very loose and sandy. Tread carefully. Someone, the FA party presumably, thoughtfully constructed a nice but somewhat shaky platform at the base. There is a loose block that you'll be tempted to grab a few feet off the ground. It may be keyed in and safe, but it moves, so best to avoid it.

    An excellent pitch; perhaps the best 5.8 sport  route I've done in Boulder Canyon.    Moderate climbing at the bottom which gradually gets harder the higher you go, with a crux around the 9th bolt.  I placed a medium wired nut below the crux, and a #1 Camalot in the corner leading to the anchor.    A 70m rope is perfect; you can lower and touch down with several feet of rope to spare.

    Sort of different beta and cont...  From the break, left hand to good hold and match, then right hand to two finger crimp, left hand to undercling.  Then I go right hand up to the gaston in the slot, left hand comes up to a sharp crimp just to the left of the right hand (this seems to be a foot hold and not used much).  Go left again to the good pinch, some good footwork will make those moves easier. This beta may not be the best considering there were a few chalked holds out right I didn't use.

    Okay...so obviously I got to the break in the climb! Then I enter the dihedral hold the left good hold. Go up right hand to a gaston undercling thing, left hand to the undercling. Then, I bump my right hand to the 2 finger crimp, and can get my foot around the arête! Does anyone know any beta from here or any alternate beta for this climb? It would be greatly appreciated!

    Squeezed and contrived 1 star route.  Kind of silly when I somehow feel that I need to try and stay off of the holds on the Good Book and Mustard Seed.  I could have clipped bolts on those as well during the climbing... classic example of BoCan gone wrong.

    Not a bad route, although quite easy to join into the good book, if you stick to the arete you will be o.k. with some feet on the face to the left of the arete, the move after the little roof seems to be the crux.

    People are bagging on this route, and I suspect it's due to the controversy of the crag, but you should definitely get on it. It's pumpy and good the whole way.    I won't give any moves beta, but I found two distinct cruxes split by non-trivial 5.9 climbing. First crux seemed to be getting off the ground, though once you figure out the sequence, it's not too bad. The second crux is at the roof, with the big pinch hold. I found it pretty strenuous to pop my feet over the roof and get situated in the finger crack. Two more moves on thin feet and you're through the business.    All that said, it's probably around 10c overall and great fun.

    Have to agree with Liz here. I have led many 5.8s and found this one to be pretty sporty for 5.8 (guess that's why there is a plus sign after it in the guidebooks). I actually found it more challenging than the supposed 5.9/5.10 climb on the left side. The climb is safe, though, because it is well bolted; so, have at it, but imho would be challenging for a newer 5.8 leader. But hey, everyone has different strengths and likes. An enjoyable, if short, climb.

    I'm with Bubbster on this one.  He usually downgrades everything, so if he says the move is 5.12, it surely is at least that.  I've tried this several times, and I can't even figure out what the move is supposed to be, and like Tony says, it's not just a single move but a couple of hard moves until you get to a jug.  The feet just seem non-existent.  It's bolted close enough to French-free through the crux if you finally give in.

    Try it when it is humid out. Felt like 5.12 to me and my partner then.... Triple clutching and deadpointing onto slippery slopers.    Maybe the 'jug' is gone?

    I know Boulder Canyon grades are soft, but this route is stretching it a bit.  It definitely has one tricky move, but that doesn't make for a 12a.  Like almost all of the newer Boulder Canyon sport climbs, let's knock it down two grades.  That would be a bit more honest.

    One of the first ascentionists of this classic climb, Mike O'Brien, passed away within the last couple of years.  I learned this about a week ago when on a road trip to El Rito, N.M., Henry Lester pulled out a collector's quality, Swiss-made, wood shafted, north wall hammer to pound in the tent stakes. After remarking on its beauty, Henry informed me that he had acquired it from Mike's estate.      I doubt that when Mike bought this hammer as a young man in the '50s for his alpine adventures that he imagined that it would ultimately be used by two sport climbers to hammer in tent pegs some 60 years later, or even imagine "sport" climbing for that matter. But, he might have appreciated that some of his associations with climbing, whether that be his hammer or his super cool route, Cozyhang, have remained within the climbing realm.

    Back in the '70s, before it got so polished and slick, you could walk right up it, even in non-sticky shoes (Royal Robbins), that's where the rating comes from.  First time I did it (1972), I was told it was a "tricky 5.6, just trust your feet and don't hug the rock". That's a pretty common occurence in high traffic areas.  Look at all the holds in Eldo that are greasy with chalk, if you don't use chalk the rating feels like at least 1 or 2 numbers above the original.

    For the second pitch we went right around the block from the first belay for some reason.  This is a bit of a grovel up an easy chimney.  Still ended up at the second belay spot below the devious P3 crux roof problem. I do feel that the P1 and P3 cruxes are 5.8.
    Oct 8, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I honestly felt getting over the third layered roof on the first pitch was a harder move than the crux roof on p3. Maybe because the pigeons living on the crack of the roof were rooting for me. The cozy belay spot isn't so cozy, but the traverse isn't all that bad if your careful.

    One glory of climbing is that we can all have different experiences on the same moves. Climbed Cozyhang for the first time this morning.

Pushing off a right hand jam in the wall behind me made it casual.

Another time, with Charlie, (a partner of many roadtrips (Castleton Tower, Shelf Road, Indian Creek, etc) and alpine climbs), we climbed Christmas week when there were many inches of ice seeping out of the crack at the traverse into the slot.

    Fun route, although I like the Owl a bit better. I linked p1 and 2 - the rope drag was getting pretty bad at the end, but not unbearable. The traverse is kinda tricky, but didn't feel any harder than say 5.6ish (good pro before and after the hard moves). The second definitely needs to be solid at that grade. I've done the crux roof at the end several times now, and wow, it sure feels hard for a 5.7....
    May 9, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Not a whole lot that feels real "cozy" about this route. I would echo a comment above that even seconds need to be pretty solid because there are some traverses necessary that you just can't completely protect. Unclipping and downclimbing under the "cozyhang" belay is a tricky bit for a newer climber. It's all there, but a little polished and you can't always see your feet the way you would like because of bulges. Also that pin at the top of the final roof has got to be the mankiest thing i have ever seen. Should go any day soon and wouldn't trust it for anything important like maybe say, your life. Nice to be able and get out in climb in January at 65 degrees!

    You are quite correct Adam. I apologize for not articulating. My point was that the feet are small and polished (a la pigeon)  for the traverse and woe betide the second having to unclip the piton and downclimb to the traverse who is not lead-solid at a 5.7 grade. It is just a little spooky for anyone new to the grade, etc. When I mentioned the alternate finish, I was referring to the 5.10a/b crack-traverse that I believe Ben Mottinger has a picture of on The Owl. You may reach this by not passing it on the way to the last overhang of Cozyhang (there are what... five on the route if you include the starter overhangs...?). It takes immaculate cams in the 1-1.5" range if I recall and gives you a bit of a pump due to the lack of feet. That's what I was referring to, though I remember the bit JUST below the top of Cozyhang (getting off the rest ledge and up to the last 10 feet) was also a bit challenging for my girlfriend. Trust the rope, try something funky, and as James Garnett says, Crank, I tell you!!! ~Wm

    Hmmm...I think you are wanting to say that the traverse is 5.8 while my comment was directed only at the overhang on the upper pitch.  I'm not sure if I'd necessarily agree that this is too sandbagged at 5.7, but might make a note that it's a difficult 5.7.  The upper overhang, however, is definitely harder than 5.7, going at what I would say is either a hard 5.7+ or tricky 5.8-.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    After climbing this for the third time the other day, I'm inclined to say that the traverse is a bit sandbagged. At least at 5.7 anyway. I agree with Adam. 5.8 is my grade due to the size of the holds and moves. Rope drag can be a bit of a bear... If you have time, make it three pitches. If not, link one and two together, but make certain your rope doesn't get snagged in the notch just west of the 'hang. Anyone know the real rating for the alternate finish at the top of pitch two? I onsighted Blind Faith on the Bastille and fell on this. Maybe I was too pumped out from a recue performed, but still... If you choose to do this roof (which you ALL should), throw a cam in high, clip it, and go for the fist jam after two positive hands in the crack. It's a GREAT  finish.~Wm

    I think the roof might be sandbagged, but not all that much.  I'd say it goes at a tricky 5.8 or 5.7+, personally, the crux being figuring out that your head is the most versatile piece of equipment in your quiver.  I just put my foot out left on the good ledge, hands on the chalked flake and went left hand way up to the small v-slot, then jammed my head, right hand in the pocket, and right foot up.  from there I could peek out, reach right hand up into the seam, and sort of squeeze with my legs straddling the arete until I could reach the bomber handhold at the back.      It pumped me out, sure, but I thought it was just tricky, and you just have to stay balanced and not worry about things like exposure and pro (namely the fact that there's an ankle breaking ledge below your last piece you will surely nail).  I've climbed easier 5.10's, though.  Anyone try the 5.9+ on th eleft-side, I think it's called Gorilla's Delight?  Whatever the second pitch is, that first .9+ corner is a bastard.  Maybe it's just something with th eDome...

    I agree with the last poster: tricky bulge on the first pitch. I'd also like to suggest that trusting the fixed pins here (and elsewhere on this route for that matter) is not such a great idea. My brother and I did this last weekend, I led every pitch, and didn't clip a single pin...many are have cracked eyes, and all are manky. Doesn't matter too much, though, as there is plenty of gear placements wherever needed.    The last pitch's roof is definitely a sandbag at "new school" 5.7 -- but, if you get stumped, it eats up the gear and shouldn't be too tough to aid through if necessary with just a couple cams and some long slings.    Great route.

    I agree, this top roof is harder than 5.7 to onsight, but is maybe 5.7 after you have it wired.  I remember the first time I cranked over the roof I thought "must be a good jug here if this is 5.7" - 30 seconds later I was still looking for it.  You have to stem and use the feet well to get over this.  The E Slab roof is also tricky for many beginners although at a considerably easier level.

    Myke, I agree about the roof seeming harder than 7.  Did it yeserday.  Did The Owl and finished going up thru this "A" roof variation.  It protects well and even has an old pin to clip up near the opening, which I backed up with a stopper.  Once you pull up thru and are standing up there exposed, you realize there isn't much to work with except for the one crack which I threw the last two fingers on the right hand in and locked.  Not much for the left hand to grab. Thankfully your standing on the chocked up ledge underneath.  I placed a shakey .3 camalot in the shallow crack that probably would have pulled had I fallen, as my fingers began to slip from persperation while I pulled the rope for the clip and thought of a acquaintance who decked from there and broke his ankle a few years back. I managed to regrip and crank up enough to reach a knob for the left foot and a rest.  IMHO it felt harder than its rating but it was fun nonetheless.

    You can also link up pitches 2 and 3 with acceptable levels of rope drag.  I remember having 2 pieces for the traverse, both with shoulder slings on them.... after scrambling left and then back right, the rope was straight down from me once I was at the roof.    Why is this roof so hard for me?  Maybe it's that old-school 5.7 rating... stupid old-schoolers, denying me my ego-stroking boost...
    Oct 13, 2002

    What a great, unusual route this is! When I first started climbing it seems I was always at the Dome. There are a few great moderate routes here. I remember thinking the bulge on the first pitch was so desperate... It still is non-trivial.    A few years ago, with George Bell, I led this route in one pitch with no simul-climbing! Now this involved some SERIOUS rope drag! Why do this? We were trying to go fast and do this, the Owl, and the East Slab during our lunch hour. I'm not sure doing this as one pitch sped things up though. It's got to be one of the more ridiculous things I've done while climbing...
    Jul 9, 2002

    Great route! We did it in 2 pitches instead of 3. If you use long slings you can skip the first belay head right on up to the second belay ledge without the rope drag getting too bad. Watch out for bird poop!

    This seemed harder than 10a to me. I'm pretty sure that the new guidebook lists this as 10d, but I might be reading it wrong. I am very short (5'6"), and had to use a combination of hand jamming, dyno, and no feet to make it through the crux (which protects very well). The lack of feet made it feel like 10+ to me. Again, I'm short so this may not be true for everyone.

    The crux is the finger crack trending right, with fingers in the crack and smearing on the face, above the drop off for a little excitement.  But bomber pro here.    Didn't think the slab was runout...but I've been trad climbing for a long time....
    Mar 17, 2012

    Seemed pretty runout through the slab section to me.  Probably only 15ft to easy climbing, but then another 6ft to some tiny nut possibilities, then another 6 to a bomber #2 Camalot.  Perhaps I was off route, but I went up what I thought was a reasonable line to the black streak.  Also, I thought the crux was in the upper half of the slab (the runout section), rather than the finger crack down low, where I didn't feel that I was smearing.
    Sep 4, 2011

    I started the direct start of East Slab, but when I pulled onto the upper slab and saw someone trying to toss topropes down the route, I cut right and followed the right leaning crack to the black streak and pulled the easy jug roof.  This was 5.6 for the East Slab direct start and felt no harder than 5.5 for the rest.
    Jul 11, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The finger crack is the 5.7 crux of the route, and you do have to smear a bit. The other 5.7 part is the right hand-jam exit, protected with a 2" cam.     A good variation to this route that greatly reduced rope drag is to get to the ramp and continue straight up via a series of right-facing flakes. This way is more sustained 5.6 (with less pro) but gets you directly to the black streak. The (harder) right exit ends with a sloping 3" crack, so don't be surprised. Great naturals for the top anchor, though.

    Climbed this on Father's Day with my son. This was my first climb in CO when I moved here many years ago &amp; my son's first trad climb this time. It was also my first climb anywhere in about 15 yrs and first lead in about 17 yrs.     A really fun climb, albeit a little scary in places for the grade. Getting off the ground is the hardest part, especially for shorter folks (I'm 5'9"). Protects well except for the section above the crack.     I climbed extensively in the past and felt comfortable leading this, despite the long hiatus since last climbing. I would agree with some of the other reviewers that this might be a tough lead for 1st time trad leaders but only due to the difficulty of placing pro in the section above the crack.     I never felt that there was much difference between 5.6 and 5.7 but could argue for either rating. It was rated 5.5 at one time, but that's probably a sandbag. I'd call it 5.6, but I might just be getting old....

    Unless I did another route by mistake, (I don't think so) this is a one pitch route, about 50 meters. Good route on quality rock. I think the crux is getting off the deck; the footing is a tad awkward.

    Today I on-sight free soloed this route directly. Pulling the roof was awesome. Graciously grabbing both sides of an amazing horn of rock that points ever abruptly down towards the void, my soul told me to cut feet, so I released, stabbed the ledge with my foot and felt dynamic perfection, rested, then continued onwards to the finish. Despite my belief that cruxing is almost completely self-imposed, I think I inevitably had a few edgy moments when the cracks die, just for a few feet, where I had to trust my foot jams, rubber, and ability before running into horizontal seams. I believe these couple moves can be done with utter solidity with a few practice sessions, onsight however, I believe it will be a little precarious for most. All in all, very inspiring route, great rock quality with sweet granite movement.

    Used to guide this a lot back in the mid 1990s, so got it totally wired. Once climbed it with my friend Doug in 24 minutes, car-to-car (and yes, we led and belayed the route normally). It was quite aerobic, as I recall.

    This is a great route with varied climbing. It has good jams, a cool roof crank, some tenuous slab, and vertical stemming. Don't let the 5.6 fool you -- this rock is stout. I've climbed comparable 8s, and there's a short runout section that is spooky. The gear placements are available but tricky -- this is not a good beginner lead. Furthermore, the leader goes out of view of the belay almost immediately, and even if you do it in two pitches, communication will likely have to be done with the rope, especially if the river is high. As such, I recommend one pitch, since communication is a problem anyway, rope drag is not an issue, and p2 is super-duper short.

    Did this today in a howling wind -- 65 mph gusts at Nederland.  About got blown off near the top!  Great route.  Direct start felt 5.7 to me for the first 9 ft.  The rest of the climb to the "roof" was no harder than 5.6 IMO.  Belayed below the roof, then walked to the left side of the "roof" and climbed the "tall", right-facing dihedral (see pic).  Climbing (jamming &amp; stemming) over that 10' section felt pretty stiff for 5.6.  After rapping back down (to retrieve gear) I went over the roof the 2nd time about 20 ft right of the tall dihedral, and it was just an easy step over.

    Pretty continuous 5.6 the whole way.  Holds and pockets materialize just where you need them, but expect solid 5.6 the whole way.  I'd agree with maybe not doing this for your first lead as it can be a little heady.    Do as one pitch, lots of extra rope w/ a 60 meter.

    Came back on Saturday, to do this again.  This is always a good refresher to Boulder area trad-climbing in the sense that it still has a fair bit of heady climbing above gear (for the grade).  There is some (not much) pro above where the crack runs out.  However, you'll need a blue alien or yellow zero or one of those new white tricams for one placement, or be prepared to be in a lousy spot placing a #1 Camalot.  Especially for the latter, these will feel like psych pro if you're gripped.  Which is funny because you can get some AWESOME pro right in the top of the crack, and the climbing isn't that hard in the runout section.  Doubly so since the hardest move of the runout section is the one where you commit to leaving the crack.  If you blow it there, you won't go far.

    This was my first ever outdoor climb - I followed a friend and came back 4 months later to lead 2 of my friends.  It's a great place to learn and offers enough exposure to get a beginner seriously excited!  Also, I agree with earlier commenters that it's a great place to learn to lead trad.  The beginning offers substantial pro, and the hardest move (about halfway) feels very protected.  As you get higher it gets slabbier and easier, but chances for pro also dwindle (although they are still sufficient), providing a great feel for being on lead without much risk for first-timers.  Overall, an awesome easy intro climb. (another bonus is it can be fairly easily protected with only nuts and hexes - good for a beginner rack lacking the more pricey cams)

    George- a couple of easier trade routes in Boulder canyon are the Pine Tree route (3rd Elephant Buttress) and the West Crack (Castle Rock).  Both of these are also 5.5, but anyone at their limit on either would feel sandbagged by this one, imho.

    The route did not disappoint. Excellent quality rock and a really fun lead for relatively new leaders (like me) who are comfortable with a little runout.     We had to leave a #2.5 tri cam that fell back into the crack somewhere between 20-30' up the 5.6 start to the route. It's a little too far back to get at with a nut tool, but if someone does fish it out, I'll give them $5 for it. Email me at silverbrothers@cs.com. Thanks and enjoy the route.

    I felt sandbagged as a beginner follower and years later as a leader. You'd really have to have it worked, I think to go at 5.5 and most people don't. it's the kind of granite where your toe and finger have to be on the exact little crystal. Therefore, IMO, it onsights for most at .6 or better. Either way, it's recommended.

    Led this again for the first time in 25 years.  That's right, I'm an old fart.  I first climbed the East Slab as part of the CMC IRCS class I took back in 1977.  Thought a bit of perspective might be of interest.    While I and my partners waited for two other teams to climb the route, I noticed everyone was heading straight for the tree from the top of the jam crack.  Back in the 70s we had 150' ropes and belayed below to location, where another comment indicates to crank.  Our 150' ropes wouldn't let us do the route in one pitch.  The belay point is over to the left.  To get there, we'd diagonal up and left at the top of the jam rather than taking the current straight up to the tree route.    I know the route was rated 5.5+ back then.  The current route doesn't seem much if any more difficult, but has a bit more run out.    Anyway the route was still a bunch of run for this old fart.  I wouldn't recommend it for a first lead, although (IMO) it's a better protected first lead than anything on the Flatirons.

    A true Friday after-work classic.    Hints:    At the very top of the crack, a #4 Rock. Jam up high and then reach up way high and to the right (1 o'clock) and there is sloper mantle to a jug....next to the jug is good #5 placement.     That way a direct line is taken and the slab sews-up.

    Compared to Eldo or the Flatirons, Boulder Canyon granite always seems slippery and sandbagged to me.  I don't really know what I'd rate the East Slab, but it is certainly one of the easiest routes in Boulder Canyon, I can't think of anything easier in fact.  I do not believe it is a good "first lead" for a beginner.  The rock is slick if you are not used to Boulder Canyon granite and it's not like you can sew the thing up.  In fact on the upper slab seems runout to me, but at least it is low angle.
    Mar 16, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    At the risk of starting a ratings debate, I'm adding a bit on this one.  The primary difficulty that beginning leaders have on this rock is not that the moves are hard, but rather that they are not obvious.  If you go slowly and pay careful attention to the climb---perhaps in a low-threat situation like following---you'll probably see that each move is quite straightforward, but that there is often only one rest stance at any point.  It may be necessary to switch feet to be in the correct position to get to the next one.  I'm 6'00" and there is exactly one place past the start where I find any need to resort to pure smearing with no handhold; a shorter person might need to make two such moves.  At every other point there is a good rest stance (although some of them require thinner edging moves)---the kinds of things I expect to see on 5.4s.  WIth that in mind, and considering that the degree of exposure should not inflate the grade, I feel safe in calling this a "fair 5.5."  The trick is, of course, to wire the moves together in order to achieve that grade, and you're probably not going to be able to do that if you're jumping onto the route for the first time with no running beta.  Note as well that the 5.6 start is like a microcosm of the entire climb: if you know the right things to do, it's 5.6.  If you don't, then you can turn the start into a 5.8.  (The key to the start is to not trust the chalk marks when feeling about for the correct place to jam.)  This route a great example of one where a thoughtful approach will achieve more than a brute-force attack.

    The East Slab is a terrific first time lead.  The pro is great for the first half of the route.  I used lots of cams (#.5 - #3), a few stoppers, and a couple of hexes.  A little spooky when the fist crack runs dry, but in my humble opinion, the ample pro will give any first time leader the confidence to finish the climb.  Fun!  5.7- start in the dihedral (maybe 5.6+) and 5.5+ for the rest of the climb.

    If you don't belay from the tree, but rather the gash about 8 feet below and to the right of it, you can see your partner the whole time (once past the opening dihedral) and cut down on considerable rope drag.  Its a third class scramble from there to the walk off gully.  Save the trees!

If you're having trouble with the end of the crack proper, stack your feet until they can go no higher and look around for pockets. Just for the joke-record, my ascent time was :10 + or - a minute because I was fiddling with cams and having too much fun... Bummer...~Wm

    Lead this one yesterday and was definitely humbled.  "A mere 5.5," I said to myself.  Should've checked the beta here first!  I took the direct line after clearing the dihedralon the right side.  The crack really does vanish in there somewhere (things are a little hazy) but there are a series of acceptable finger and toe pockets and diagonal fracturesspaced every fifteen feet or so.  Traversing left on the top one and then back right under the roof might well yeild an easier route, but I was concerned with rope drag.  Pro is good (smallish and medium cams and a couple nuts/hexes/tricams).  Still, a south-facing wall in the hot noon-day sun and no chalk made the hands slipperier than I like, but the feet are solid.  All in all, an exciting, fun climb with reasonably good gear and great exposure.  I'd have to lobby for the 5.6 rating, rather than the 5.5 presented in various books.  Not my first trad lead by any means, but certainly one of the more exciting ones.

    Very true, William.  The footwork on this one makes it a good climb for "intermediate beginner" climber types who are ready for the next challenge, not for first timers wondering what trad is all about.  I recently led this with only one good hand (the other too sore from a horked tendon) though, which was a good way to reinforce just how solid the feet are---although it made those tricam placements a little sketchy.
    Aug 6, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    James, I suppose my reply would be that you're correct: there IS always a fingerhold somewhere and there are pretty good stances for gear placement (that is, WHEN you place gear...), but in the one really tricky part about 2/3 up the route, the holds have potential to FREAK out a beginner. That's all I'm saying. It's not impossible and it certainly ain't-not-fun, it's just a tad dicey for the first outing. I was the last climber on one rope (simuling) the first time I did this guy and never felt uncomfortable, but it did make me a little nervous to lead the first time. And crank I shall!WM

    Hey William, you must've been having a bad day or been seriously off route; this one is a fair 5.5 after the start.  True, the disappearing crack disappears, but the feet are always bomber, and there's (almost) always a bomber  fingerhold within reach---and anytime you need to place pro you have a rest stance.I love turning the little wannabe roof off the flake at the top!  Crank!  CRANK, I tell you!

    Excellent Route !!! I climbed it for the first time last Saturday. Ample pro until the crack finishes. I recommend climbing it in a single pitch (the Belay station is awkard and hard to protect .... at least I thought so !!!) Not a good first lead .... leave it for your 4th or 5th outing.

    Fun climb. I did this route as my first climb on real rock a couple of years ago and found it a little scary in parts, returned to it recently and of course it was a lot easier! Amazing how the rock had changed...I would rate it as a good beginner climb, but maybe not the best for ones first outing. The 5.6 start is a little tricky and unless u can trust your feet a bit, things get disconcerting when the crack runs out, though only for a couple of moves. Turning the roof can be a little intimidating for the beginner as well. But great climb. Only wish it was 3 times as long!
    Mar 22, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a great climb, it was my first lead trad climbing and was really fun.  About half to two-thirds of the way up the climb there is a diagonal ledge that traverses a little ways to the climber's left; this is an easier way to climb the route (and probably the right way).  I went straight up without traversing and got pretty nervous because of a tricky move to get up to a spot below the final roof (which is really easy).  I hope this helps someone to avoid that situation (which would be scary if this is your first lead...).
    Feb 27, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    To tell you the truth, the start and last third of this route are incredibly sandbagged. I'd give the first 15' a good 5.7+ or better and the last bit 5.8 due to the size of the finger crack. Bad beginner lead and rather daunting for a beginning cleaner as well. Don't hit this one up unless you really know what you're doing.

    Liked the route. Not a good beginner lead. Holds are sparse at some points near the top of the crack. It just peters out. Interesting start and a fun route overall.

    Great climb!  Perfect jams and some fun moves down low, I only wish the crack was another 100 feet long!  Once the crack ended, I aimed for a small tree on the top, pulling on a large flake with bomber holds to gain the roof.  Lots of variations possible once out of the main crack.  Fun!

    An excellent route on high-quality rock.  A great beginner's lead with the opportunity to place a good amount of pro for practice.  A bit runout towards the top, but climbing is easy and there are a few places for pro, if need be.  Enjoy!

    I typically attempt to refrain from providing such comments, but, beware, if one follows the line shown in Rossiter's book, this climb is VERY run-out above the crack which peters out. It's not difficult climbing, but it is technical. I would not recommend it as a beginner lead.    East Slab is much more protected on the slab than East Slab East.
    Mar 29, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A bit of information about this easy climb.      Yes, the East Slab is a 5.6, as 90 percent of the people who do this direct start will confirm.  However, do not be fooled into believing that this is a good first trad lead in the Boulder area to attempt.      If you are new at placing gear, mixing up crack and face climbing, or taking a few unscheduled run outs, extending draws to avoid rope drag, you'd be better served going to Eldorado and climbing the more consistent but technically harder Wind Ridge or Calypso.    With that said, this climb, now often done in one pitch with a 70m rope is on firm clean white granite and provides a varied climbing experience.

    This is a surprisingly difficult route to identify based on the guidebook.  We had a little diversion which could best be described as east of East Slab East (oopsies) which was still a fun climb.  The advice here to spot the disappearing crack should help.

    Hmm. I ended up climbing directly to the right of the roof and into a squeeze chimney. Was pretty fun. Strongly recommend using long slings for this route as rope drag is a pain otherwise.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    P2 is described in the Rossiter guidebook as a short traverse east, a couple of moves up a left-slanting ramp, and then "tiny holds" on the face straight up to the exit roof.    Climbed the route on 3/21 with S. Costello. They are indeed small holds (mostly lichenous pockets and slopers) and there is no protection for a good 20-25 feet. It didn't look like anyone had gone that way in some time. The climbing on the East Slab crack a few feet away is better protected and, IMHO, a lot more fun.    However...the exit roof (not the East Slab flake exit) should not be missed. It involves a slightly wild move before groping for a big ole jug and is the highlight of the route.
    Mar 23, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I second Matt's comment. This is an excellent route done in one (nearly full) rope length pitch with a 60 meter rope. Also, the finish is the first major crack left of the East Slab Finish. The gear is good enough in the slabby sections to prevent serious falls. I placed a pink tri-cam   in one of the huecos and a tiny bd nut in the horizontal (slightly inclined) crack midway up the "second" pitch.
    Jul 11, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    We did this in 1 long pitch (awesome!).  Using longer slings on P1, I never felt any rope drag.  Have your communication dialed as you most likely will not hear each other after the leader tops out.  Medium nuts and hexes and small/medium cams work well on this one.
    Mar 25, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I totally got off route the first time I tried this and went up the chimney instead.  No pro in that but way easy.  Tried again with the guidebook and found the line to be directly to the left of the crack on the East Slab.  I've even placed gear on this route when doing some wandering leading the East Slab.  The gear looks (and is) sparse, but there's placements in all the right places.  Bring a red #1 Camalot for the hole you find halfway up.  The crack at the first belay station ate one of my stoppers, rapped down, jumped on it, and it wouldn't budge.  All in all, this is the easiest 5.7 on the Dome but very fun, on route or lost.
    Aug 16, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Wow, lots of fun!  If you belay from the base of the right-traversing handcrack that starts P2 and extend from the anchor, you can coach your second through the P1 crux.  P2 climbs the handcrack up and right a short ways, then straight up a funky uneven crack until it ends (#8 Powercam fits here).  Climb slab with pockets to the left angling crack (small cam fits here) then up more slab with smaller pockets.  This pitch is completely distinct from East Slab.  I've drawn the line (more or less) on a copy of Gary Schmidt's picture, showing its relation to East Slab.
    Jul 11, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    In re-reading my p2 description above, it should read follow the hand traverse a few feet east instead of north. This traverse is found a few feet below the belay. Fun climb! A number 4 cam is also comforting for the final 5.7 crack/roof thing.
    Nov 25, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Did this one on Sunday and thought that it was really good!  The first pitch was easy to figure out and the description of P1 above is great.  P2 was a bit more ambigious.  I followed Gary's recommended line and I though it was fantastic and not too runout.  I was able to place a #2 and a #1 in the horizontal crack (at my feet) before going on to the face.  Also, the crack at the end is awesome, don't take the easy way out and head over to the finish for disappearing crack, you'll miss some great climbing.  I would recommend being solid at the grade as you'll have to do some hunting to find your way to the top, but you can always wimp out and do the disappearing crack finish. :)
    Nov 21, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I liked p2 quite a bit.  Got in a few pieces of pro towards the start, plugged in a number 1 cam (I believe) at the left sloping ramp, and then scrambled up the slab to the top of the East Slab route.  I didn't feel that slab climbing was 5.7, certainly it wasn't as hard as the crux on the first pitch.  Rather than go up the fun flake at the top of the East Slab, I went up the crack to the [left].  Fun!  Don't know what it was rated in Rossiter, but I've heard it was 5.7, and I'd guess it's around that level.  Excellent pro and a fun problem.
    Jul 24, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    For those who may still be wondering I believe p2 goes as follows. From the first belay find a hand traverse crack and follow that a few feet north. Then head up the friction face(about 10 ft left of the east fact crack) with some nice finger pockets until you come to a narrow left rising ramp. Traverse left along the ramp about half way then head up the face on some smallist holds (5.7) until you gain the bigger ledge. Find the obvious crack through the overhang about 15 ft west of the East face (aka Disappearing Crack) roof and jam up the somewhat intimidating looking crack (5.7). From then head straight up to the top. Of course, variations are possible but i believe this is the standard route. Fun climb with some nice variety.

    Hey Scott, I think I ended up doing the same finish as you, didn't know that that was the East Slab crack though as this was my first time on the Dome.  No matter what it was a blast!!  I ended up going up and over the roof almost directly below the tree with the massive flake and a good right foot.  You are correct where it looks like it all goes on the face, I think there was a smaller crack to the left that the actual route follows but who knows, it looked a bit shorter with a longer runout.  Does anyone know where the correct P2 of this climb goes?
    Oct 13, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Question: does P2 of this route end with the East Slab crack? From the belay chair, I traversed 10 ft right and the logical finish was to jump into the East Slab crack (luckily, right where the fun climbing begins!) I looked around for another crack, but all I saw were small seams which looked pretty incipient, i.e. wouldn't take pro well. However, it seems like you could go almost anywhere, just banking on if you can get gear or not; any suggestions? P1 of East of Sun/Cozyhang is a full on one-move wonder---but definitely tricky and 7ish. Good route!
    Aug 3, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Variation for P2. Instead of traversing right from the belay, head up and take the crack just left of the belay.  Pop out of the chimney and make a few blank face moves.  Head up to the slightly overhanging, right facing corner and jam through it to the summit.

    Gear tip: the crux move of the second pitch, which is the second vertical crack system, has a PERFECT C4 0.75 placement right under the lip. Right as you start up the crack if you look up you will see a little "hole" in the rock on the lip - a green C4 stopped a fall on the crux move flawlessly there.

    Funny back at this climb 6 years later: now the lower part (getting off the belay) was hard and then the rest felt easy.

    Feb 15, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The fixed nut is gone, but plenty of gear can be had. It is pumpy to place, but you can easily downclimb to a no hands stance before committing to the final right foot move which is insecure for sure. I think the grade of 9+ tells you everything you need to know as a leader. Linking this with Prelude in 1 pitch onsight would be proud! Kind of like a bunch of boulder problems split by easier climbing. Bring some crack skills, too.    Beta hint:  There is an arm bar pulling the lip of the first steep crack section.
    Mar 27, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This climb is yet another example of 5.9+ being way harder than 10a!    Jokes aside, I think the grade is appropriate at 9+, but all of the cruxes are insecure and therefore scary.  The gear is good enough, but the climb is hard enough to read that you end up filling up key holds with pro if you aren't careful/lucky (this refers to the King Kong start as well).    The fixed nut is still in place at the final crux, which definitely makes this thing easier.  It's probably only a #3 BD, but it practically gives you a toprope through the crux, and would surely hold a short fall.     Committing to that right foot as you rock onto the final slab is a real mental challenge.  I was pretty psyched to grab the jug after that section.
    Mar 13, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Like every other climb on the dome, Gorilla's Delight is a sandbag. The upper crux is at least 10-. There is currently a fixed nut (which I did not place) in situ at the top of the second crack (after the slab) which protects the crux very well. And it works, as I discovered.    After falling a few times off the slab moves above the crack, I decided to belay my second up to the outstanding hanging belay right below the crux, from there he could coach me through the tenuous moves out of the crack and onto the slab.    Fun climb! Probably the climb that wanders the least on the dome!
    Nov 18, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Man! What a fun route, it got me pumped though!  I found the crux to be the transition from the arching crack that narrows to fingers and tips to the slabby finish, took a 15 footer! I eventually managed to do it.  I found this to be harder then the 10a variation to the second pitch of The Owl.
    Oct 7, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I also thought the second crux on GD was harder than 9+... although I've felt like most the routes on The Dome are slightly sandbagged, I was cruxing hard, well above my gear, going from the lie back onto the face below the belay crack. Great lead!
    May 28, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    For those trying to onsight don't read further:    My gear was as follows:  #1 (Camalot) in the crack above the belay, then #0.75 or smaller cams/nuts after that in the dihedral.  #1 or 2 (with a long runner) in the same crack once you gain the slab, then a #2 to start the second crack, #0.75 higher, then a great, mid-sized nut and yellow Alien just above the lip right before you set off onto the slab.  After that I found it pretty hard to place gear...though you can place some difficult small nuts and a green Alien (yellow-green offset would be perfect) if you can find the time to stop.    If you want to TR the cruxs...I recommend setting up a belay right after the 2nd crux.  Mid-sized gear in the horizontal or #1-#4 in the crack above.  This way you can see your second and avoid rope drag on the easy slabs above.  In fact it was nice to run laps on the two cracks.
    Feb 7, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The thin 'alternate' crack out left at the second crux seems more 5.9+ than the main crack to me.  I did climb this after many months solely in the gym bouldering (so crack climbing felt alien), however I thought the second crux was a 5.10 move to lieback, smear, and gain the jugs.  Sure repeating it on TR afterwards it didn't feel that bad, but trying to onsight this climb is pretty difficult if you are thinking 5.9+ (and you climb around that grade on trad).  Think OLD school grading, make sure your gear is bomber, and relax on the slab (unlike me).     Actually repeating it on TR it still felt like a 5.10 move to me and the left crack felt easier - though it would have also been hard to lead.  I took a nice long fall with my hands about 6" from the jugs...with rope stretch landed on the slab between the two cruxes below - but not hard.  Make sure you place good gear before committing to the slabby 2nd crux, because it is very insecure, pumpy (not really after you know the moves though), and a long fall if your gear blows here as Doug mentioned.  Basically I got my ass kicked.  At least I went for it (with good gear placed) and took the fall.      Overall, a great little line...kind of like two crack boulder problems in a row.  I'm not really into free soloing, but leaving my personal feelings aside you have to give the man some props - because that is BOLD even nowadays to onsight.

    Great finish for Prelude To Kong, but expect it to be significantly more difficult.  I found the crux to be in the corner above the traverse right, where you roll onto your right foot after a fairly sustained lieback.  Really not that big of a deal, but it is a bit heady - as you are committed a few moves above your last piece and a good 5+ feet from your next one.  It felt 9+/10- to me, but I think a second go at it would prove that the 9+ is more appropriate.

    We climbed this tonight and I led P1 and followed P2.On P1, the first move up and around into the dihedral isn't too bad... good holds.  The next move is more cruxy and favors taller folks, with decent holds way up high, but not much for feet.  My shorter partner,could not reach the high holds and settled for working the thin crack, which is good down low but off hands higher.  Once past that move, easy climbing to a ledge.The start of P2 is cool...yard up off the ledge using a good little flake out left and the crack to the right (a bit smooth from chalk build up) to a pretty airy stance.  Work up the overhanging corner over a bulge and exit right.  Make a delicate traverse right (runnout) over to a nice flake and mini ledge to start the layback.  Work up the flake (crux), smearing the feet and reaching left  for a high seam, then step up.  Follow a wide crack a short distance up to the summit...

    As I'm sure many of you know, "Hot Henry" Barber on-sight free soloed this in the mid-1970s and, according to his account, came closer to taking the big one on it than on any of his other solos.  When climbing GD this is easy to understand- a difficult start into thin, insecure climbing, and a bit of routefinding on the slab. Henry stated that, in retrospect, it was a poor choice for a free solo, but his approach at that time was pretty much to "do it and ask questions later", so to speak.  I always found it curious with his comment that, when confronted with the possibility of a fall from the slab 100+ feet up, he scanned the ground and tried to picture where it would be best to land- as if a fall from that height was survivable.    Henry was perhaps the most impressive and accomplished of the 1970s free climbers, and unquestionably had the greatest influence on world-wide climbing standards of any climber at the time.  He was one of the first climbers to travel widely.  His style was to show up at an area, and blow the local standards out of the water.  In one trip, he single-handedly jumped technical standards in Australia by more than a number grade.  Other accomplishments include succeeding on the often-tried Butterballs in Yosemite (a climb that everybody who was anybody had attempted) with an almost mystical onsight, pre-camming protection; blazing a trail of desperate first ascents in the Gunks; onsight free-soloing dozens of routes on many different rock types, up to hard 5.10, at a time when the 5.11 grade was only starting to soldify; and blowing the climbing world away with his free solo of the Steck Salathe on Sentinel in Yosemite.  His repetoire of moves, creativity, and problem-solving abilities, and his tremendous self-confidence and mental control, set him apart from his contemporaries.  In the 1970s Gunks, he was an integral member of the "A Team" quartet: Henry, John Stannard, Steve Wunsch, and John Bragg. Unfortunately, his career ended on a sour note after an epic accident with Rob Taylor on Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.  The press was always a bit harsh on Henry, perhaps due to his brash personality (a little backstabbing occurred in the original CLIMB! book when the only photos of Henry were of him failing on Kloberdanz), but his significant contributions to freeclimbing standards are undeniable.  I find it curious that many young climbers have never heard of Hot Henry- kind of like music lovers who think Paul McCartney's first band was The Wings.

    Nice climb, though the 2nd crux is definitely balancey.  One month after I led it (in 1997 or so), I went back with a different partner.  He fell at that spot, pulling his gear, and landed on the ledge 25 feet below.  He fractured a rib, broke his arm, and sustained a head injury (no helmet).

    Mike, did you do this route as you describe it? I gather from your route description you did not but simply added it to the site based on Rossiter's description? I'm taking that on the fact that you list the gear as "no gear for the crux move from the looks of it". If you did do it, I'd love to know your 5.10d beta as I thought it was pretty much 2 number grades harder than that.    I spoke with Mark Wilford (reported first ascentionist) and Richard Rossiter (guidebook author) about this route, and they both said the same thing. What's listed in Rossiter's guidebook as "Groove" is actually the route listed as "Pussycat" as well, meaning the two routes are one and the same and the redundant route listing in the guidebook was an accident.    To do "Groove" as described in Rossiter's book (route 12b on p12 in Rock Climbing Boulder Canyon) is somewhere between a 5.12 and 5.13- dyno, depending on your height. I'll add it to the database later with the corrected beta etc.

    Has anyone actually climbed this before? My partner and I decided to climb all the roof routes here today and I could figure out three. 1) Cozy Overhang, which is about 5 feet to the right of The Owl corner/roof. 2) There is a dike/groove going out the very center of the roof. There is an old fixed pin in the back of the roof and the ceiling is choss, but there's a distinct "U" cut out at the lip where the dike runs up and left. Is this Groove? 3) Pussycat is on the far right side, basically where the roof ends and the rock goes into the chimneyish crack next to East of the Sun. This route cuts hard left along a seam and around the corner to a left-angling crack/ramp. 1 and 3 matched their descriptions well, including their grade. 2 seemed like in the right location, but definitely not the right grade.    We got on all three today and the center one is ridiculous. It's a massive, basketball-style dyno from the slab to the lip where a sloper jug awaits, then a funky mantle. A fall from the lip, at least how I mantled it, is asking for a head-first digger onto the slab below. Super "R" if not worse if you botch that. Hell, even the jump is "R". Mark is a mega-strong beast, but he's not exceptionally tall and so the dyno seems unrealistic (especially at the 10d grade) for his route Groove. Also, the roof is chossy with exfolitating flakes and no real holds, so there's no option of getting horizontal on it (especially for the grade). So the question is, where's the route Groove go? Rossiter's description places it exactly here, but I can't imagine that it's correct. I could easily have seen him do either Cozy Overhang or Pussycat and called it 5.10, and then the location of the route got lost in translation in the guidebooks. Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

    Fun. Good pro. Easier 5.7 than others on this crag. Belay spot at top of 1st pitch is less than ideal, but not too uncomfortable. Be prepared to get creative.

    The direct start to the 5.5 finish doesn't seem to be mentioned above. This makes a very nice and obvious, aesthetic line, but perhaps is S for pro.  Climb the open book to the left of the regular start, approaching it via the blunt arete on the right. This leads to the left edge of the roof and into the second part of the dihedral. The climbing is easy, since it's low angle, but there's not much for your hands or for gear, since the crack is closed off and/or rounded. You get  good gear every 15' feet or so--bring double green to red Aliens or the equivalent.

    Before you leave the belay ledge you can sling a wobbly chockstone with a 4' runner about thigh level on the right side of the 5.7 crack.  The moves up the crack are pretty airy but there are good hand holds on the left and jams in the crack.
    Nov 13, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    You can also start this route about 75 feet below the 5.7 crack, left of the A-shaped roof and the large pointy flake.  Cruise left up the ramp to an undercling and make a fun move through the first wall.  Angle right to the bottom of the crack, a #4 camalot is nice to have here.  Continue as from the first belay in the original description. The route can be done with a 50 M rope in one pitch with no rope drag this way.

    I climbed this route yesterday right off the couch and slightly injured. I didn't think twice about going straight up the Owl's first pitch instead of wandering out left. Mentally I thought I was still climbing a 5.7+. When I got to the crux, I was able to find a placement for my smallest BD offset (0.1/0.2), and it sunk in the little seam just before committing to the exciting, crimpy layback moves with sequential footwork. SPICY! I found this to be the best way to climb The Owl reducing rope drag and allowing the option for one long pitch with a 70m rope to reach the summit.

    I posted this under the Dave Clark photo:  Instead of going right to the chickenheads as shown here, I recently followed cracks left and then right to end up just below the huge roof where there is a pin and some tat. From there, a difficult move right can be made (mossy and wet), and I ended up with feet on top chickenhead. Anyone know the name of that variation? Or grade? Rossiter guide makes it seem like the first ascent traversed that way to get into the A-frame/hand crack exit for the end of the first pitch.

    A classic Kor route as mentioned from the previous posts. Not straightforward like Kor's route on Cob Rock, but very thought provoking, route finding and protection skills needed.

    The Owl is worth all the stars, but it's a "Kor" route, so that explains the 5.7 rating, but forget about the rating and climb it. My partner was not offering up any beta, so I found it kept me guessing and engaged. I felt like I just climbed a classic and was thrilled.

    Sandbagged and confusing, not for a beginner lead - probably best if you are a 5.8-5.9 leader because you can get yourself in some pretty sketch locations if you get lost like I did.  The climbing was ok, but not great, combined with the fact that you'll spend half your time wondering if you're on route.  D'Antonio gives it lots of stars, perhaps he knows exactly where to go, I almost want to give it the bomb for the aforementioned reasons.

    Beware - classic Boulder sandbag!
    Apr 28, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Yesterday I on-sight free soloed this route. After soloing the slab for the second time and on-sighting the leftmost problem on the East Boulder, therefore finishing the boulder's problems in the on-sight, no-crash pad style, I began up the Owl. Cruising and criss-crossing, I traversed right confronting the "chickenheads". With a quick jerk and snag, I latched a distant knob. My right foot then naturally slid urgently to the lower knob. Pulling over I felt relieved. This initial sequence was over, and went smoothly at that. With a simple yet high step, I was beneath a roof. Confident on hand jams I proceed not knowing the shit show my sight to feet ratio was going to be. Looking back I should have smeared right more, but once I felt the awkwardness set in, I reverted to classic foot below hand jams. Unfortunately the position greatly hindered the sight, feel, and movement of my foot jams, so I put as much body to the wall as I could and powered my hand jams over into the depth of the "V"-shaped slot. Groveling into easy territory, I quickly became free and danced the slab to the final roof, which I found to be the crux. After a few attacks and subsequent retreats, I committed. Right hand jamming high in the right crack, I stood up with my left completely this time, hoping to find a jam or something to sustain gracefully through the obstacle, yet to no avail. I resorted to grope around the left roof arete. Finding what seemed decent in the heat of the moment, I crimped. Matched feet for balance symmetry, and somehow, after a bit of desperation, found a perfect little knob that seemed to be directly above the apex of the roof. Wish I knew that was there. The next few moves appeared to be weird but turned out to be an amazing, exposed, almost completely horizontal rest directly above the roof. Feeling refreshed, I began the escape from my rock bed and stretched my way into the final hand crack. I spent probably ten minutes in the crack feeling the wind and thought before ending the route. Awe inspiring experience. Oddly I felt good about my climbing despite the moments of adverse distress.
    Jan 24, 2013

    Tonnes of fun. Excellent pro. Great fist jamming and some awesome committing moves. Zig-zaggy route, so draw placement and extension were tricky. Nuts and cams, varied to 3". We did 3 pitches to avoid rope drag at the cruxes. This felt pretty natural, except the 3rd pitch was quite short. Communication was difficult on this route (and all of the Dome), especially with a rushing river.

    No need to worry about the manky pin on P2: the ring and eye are gone.  I wonder if someone accidentally tested it.  A grey/yellow Alien fits below the pin.  Along with the #2 BD, this felt well protected, as long as your belayer keeps you off the slab.

    Fabulous route!  Climbed it with my wife on Friday.  Probably the toughest "short" 5.7 trad climb I've ever led.  Protects well, but had to think through the zig-zag bulges and roofs.  The moves through the A-frame roof seemed harder than 5.7 to me -- especially on my first attempt!  Second try went better after my wife graciously pointed out a good place to stem with my right foot.  Despite (or maybe because of) the challenge, I loved the route.  I'll be back!

    A 70m rope will get you to the top in 1 pitch with bad, but bearable, rope drag (finishing via the p2 .10 handcrack variation). Accidentally did an interesting variation on p1.  Instead of jogging left under the bulge and traversing back right, I went straight up to get into the small dihedral before traversing right to the chickenheads.  If you look in the photo with the description "Ran is traversing..." the line I did goes up the small crack about 10 feet right and a little bit down from the climber.  An insecure layback over ok gear was fairly exciting and felt more difficult than .7.

    I'm with Nick on this one.  I plugged a Grey Alien in the crack before the chicken heads then spent 15 minutes thinking about going for it.  The move is really easy once you grab them but if you have trouble reaching them it can be intimidating.    The roof at the top is pretty easy though, skip the piton and sink a number 2 BD to your right to keep the rope out of your way, climb up high, stem super wide, jam and arm, and it's over. I personally found grabbing for the chicken heads to be a lot more commiting than the roof. Overall a great and varied climb but I would have been very unhappy to tackle this as one of my first 5.7 leads.

    If 5.7 is around your leading limit and you're looking for climbs in this area, I personally found this to be a little harder than the Standard Route on the Elephant Buttress and a little easier than Cozyhang.

    Watch rope drag on the 1st pitch, and stay on route.  5.7 roof move on the last pitch is committing.  Aliens, 1 set of hand-sized cams, and nuts (BD stoppers #4-8) sufficient.

    This was a lead I feared for a long time, in fact I hated following it because I always muscled through the pigeon poop crack and had to take on the roof...a couple nights ago a friend showed me new techniques and it made all the difference.  Tonight on lead I learned this route can be easy but I agree it is not a beginner lead.  On lead I found (being short 5'2") that reaching for the chicken head on P1 was the hardest move since I was a bit above and right of my last piece.  The crack and the roof protect well and in a relaxed state are oh so very fun.  Now I gotta find the nerve to lead P1 (over the bulge) of Cozy Hang.

    From the belay atop P1, you can also take the 5.10/9+ hand crack that exits the roof 15 feet up and right from you.  It's somewhat awkward, in that it's half roof / half hand traverse, but an enjoyable and well-protected exit variation.

    Perhaps I climbed this "wrong", but I stepped off the pinnacle and used a twin crack system to reach a fist crack. Upon reaching the fist crack, this is where I thought the crux moves were but in no way were they 11a moves.

Not really worth the time to lead but good enough just to squeeze in another route while cragging off the anchors below Super Squeeze.

    The climb is pretty unique and interesting, but the difficulty is definitely body-size dependent.  I'm a relatively small person, but after climbing this, I have raked areas on my back and chest at the shoulder blades/pecs, and then a big raked area at the top of my big butt.  I am 5'10 and only weigh 165.  Larger climbers beware. To get my chest through I had to exhale and wiggle, to get my butt through I had to dangle my legs and relax, then swing my feet back and forth like a pendulum to wiggle through.    For gear, you should rack it all to the sides, not a single biner behind you on the gear loops.  Take stoppers + thin-hands sized gear (1.5-2" cams) and one good-hands or wide-hands piece and you can protect it very well.    Presently, one pigeon has made this home. I literally scooped a few piles of dry poop out of the left hand holds prior to the crux.    One star, normally, but maybe one less than that to account for the pigeon poop. Even the belay is tar-and-feathered with pigeon crap and feathers presently.    5.10d, but more for the will required than the skill required.  Large people will find it harder, exceptionally small people will find it easier, both due to the hand jams available (tight green to purple Camalot) and the lesser struggle squeezing through the slot.

Once my chest was through, it was a breeze. Although I enjoy wide cracks, I can't say that I feel any desire to repeat this climb unless I get tapeworms and drop 20 lbs.

    Wow. Short approach, good scenery, easy communication, engaging climbing, and "exciting" nipple and crotch stimulation make this one the better, in my opinion, "date climbs" in the Boulder region.  Definitely a pitch worth considering when trying to find that perfect route to show someone new to the sport what climbing is all about and to learn the origin of the saying "if your chest isn't bleeding, you're not trying!"

    This route actually 5.8 if you find the hidden jug at the top and have a good updraft.  The moves are much easier if you have a large torso and a huge ass.... Classic.  Good training for The Crack of Fear... which may be 5.8 too.

    After having butterflies in my stomach all day, I went for it. Climb this baby left side in, as if it wasn't already obvious enough. For the first 8', you can climb and place gear in the hand crack inside. I placed a red and gold Camalot to start. Once you start moving up you are forced outside by the laws of physics. Don't let that scare you, bust into a "chicken wing" it's the only way. You can also heel toe with your right foot. Place a number 6 and inch your way to the top.  (on-sight Baby!)

    I'm not a big dude--5'9", 145 lbs., and I had to climb out of the crack, chicken-winging hard with my left arm, kind of gastonneing/smearing with my right hand.  Hard to believe that 15-20' of climbing gets you so thoroughly pumped!  My pushing muscles--triceps/pecs (and my adductors, with regards to Mrs. Bubb!)--are aching today with nary a pain in my pulling muscles.  Re: gear, we used 2 #2 Camalots low in the crack, one about 1' above the other, and a #6 Friend, pretty tipped out, 1' above that.  If you aid this thing, take several #5 Camalots or #6 Friends, but for free climbing, I would say just place a #2 Camalot as high as you can and then punch it.  David Goldstein is right:  this thing is definitely harder than the squeeze section of the Harding Slot.

    This climb is unratable.  Stuff yourself in it and call it whatever you want.  I'm about 190 and getting inside the crack isn't even an option.  My chest won't fit in, but I can get some good chicken wings and work the lip gaston style with my right hand.  I use a #3, #2, #5, #4.5 Camalots, with some extra #1s or #2s for the anchor.  Placing a #3 low on the pitch keeps the rope out of your way if you fall out.

    This has got to be one of the nicest offwidths in Boulder (although granted, there aren't that many).  I found it to be very sustained throughout the overhanging section, with very insecure arm barring and toe heel moves, until a killer chicken wing about 10 feet out can be obtained.  I used a #5 Camalot and moved it along, until leaving it behind near where you can get up on the less steep upper face.  I'd call this test piece 5.10d and felt it had moves as hard as the crux on Crack of Fear.  Great route!

    Hard to give this nasty 10' stretch of climbing a difficulty or a quality rating.  For one thing, it's completely size dependent.  As someone who is pretty narrow front to back, I could just barely fit inside -- removing my gear sling made the difference between success and failure.  As a squeeze chimney,  the way I climbed it, it was considerably harder than the notorious squeeze chimney section of the Harding Slot; this would make Umph Slot at least 5.10.  As an offwidth, the way someone wider would have to climb it, it's probably that much harder.    Note that most of the way there is good hand size gear (and handjams) in the back, if you can reach.    Do this back to back w/ Supersqueeze for the full on abuse program -- 20' feet of climbing that will feel like that many pitches.

    The way I have done it (twice)  was one side in and one side out.  Then you can pinch the rock bewteen your thighs for friction (we called the right side of the crack "Mrs Bubb" as a joke) while thrutching up the with arm-bars and poor jams.  Be warned, if you slip in this position, you may damage "the goods. I'm a fairly small guy (5'10" 165lbs) but have VERY long arms, and I'm pretty flexible.  So, I fit further in than most people and could reach further back than most who can fit in.  I found the climb to tick in at about 5.10+/11-.    Very body-size dependent.  Smaller people have an advantage, but so do apes with VERY long arms and big paws.

    Mark must be a Hobbit or a Dwarf to get inside this route. Climbed on the outside this route is well into the 5.11 range. I recommend two #5 Camalots and a #3 Big Bro if aiding this baby (the only way I could get up it). Nothing else really fits because you can't reach in far enough to place a #4 Camalot. You do place some smaller gear at the start, but be careful you don't place it too deep and you'll need to go find Mark to retrieve it.

    Don't even have an illusion that this route is anywhere near 5.8+, unless your 4'2" and have no shoulders. You can also start this by going up The Owl and continuing left where you would go right to the bottom of Supersqueeze-5.6.

    Hi Mark,  It certainly felt hard BITD, but it's also a style I really don't do well at. So while I flashed Flying Beast for example, a bouldery short route on fairly defined holds, Buddha Belly took quite a bit longer because of its sloping abstract features.

Then the finishing move with after the stem rest...I basically smeared a foot on a small chip and stood up and went into a layback with the right hand and desperately got a right hand up right by the left to grab a very small, mono divot and pulled off that. Then I fought my feet up and kept trying to build up on the layback until I could make a big move to the jugs up top (13b/c with the rest added on).  Tell me what you all think!

    Here's the FA &amp; FFA info on this fine route.  I bolted the route &amp; then made several one hang ascents in October 1998.

Two days later it snowed.   I finally returned &amp; redpointed the route in September 2001.  I think the route is harder than 5.13a &amp; rated it 5.13b in my last guidebook "Boulder Canyon Sport &amp; Adventure Climber's Guide - Volume I".  "Buddha Belly" is harder than any other .13a in Boulder Canyon.  Compare it to "Sinopia", "Nevermore", "Flying Beast", "Green Panther", "Give The Dog A Bone", or "Vasodilator".  The route is quite sustained, especially the top half up - the powerful, sequential lieback. There are three section of .12a/b up to the .12c/d crux at the 8th bolt.  After making it through the crux, I found it hard to shake out at 9th bolt but managed to after finding the right position to straight arm off the seam. The lieback finish is .12a/b.

    Orginally the crux was a bit harder, with poor holds on the sloping shelf around the 9th bolt. When I climbed this route in 2007, someone must have pulled out a small piece of quartz, leaving a nice incut.  This made a move easier. Still the route felt about .12a.

Perhaps some of these were added by another party. One bolt in the first 15 feet would be plenty. Once it gets hard, the bolts are still pretty close, but at least they make sense thre.

    Perhaps a solution to the chipping/drilling debate is the following. One that adopts both Peter's stance of revealing the nature of the route modification without excessive policing and the general demand to put the route on a black list would be to simply place a notation line in the entry for each route. The notation line could indicate that the line was or was not natural, and if it was not natural it could indicate the nature of the enhancement. The route description could remain in place, and we would learn as much about the route as we would about any other. If it was useful, a compilation of chipped and drilled routes could be maintained under separate format. I for one do not want to loose Peter's contribution to CB.com and his insight into our more difficult lines.

    There is a dorm-fridge size semi-detached block just below the anchors, and in fact the most natural hold to use to clip the anchors is the jug formed by  the top of this block.  If you are climbing this route, especially after rain, please exercise caution. The reason I believe the block to be suspect is that I was up there on a wet day (and in fact broke a mango-size hold off lower on the route both to my and my belayer's surprise), and noticed that water seeps behind the entire block and comes out a mossy crack on the underside. On that wet day, tapping also created bad bad bad vibrations.  If there is agreement that the block is dangerous, perhaps it could be trundled (this would have to be done very cautiously, because it's likely to cause a rockslide).  In the meantime, note that it is not really necessary to even touch this block  when climbing this route. Just to the left is an equally big feature that is sound; you can easily crank on top of this and clip the anchors from the stance on top. Great moves on this route. I'd rate it 5.11, 2 stars.

    I've done this route twice, or something very close to it, but both ascents were "way back when...." This is best done in the Fall when the water leveland creek crossing doesn't factor into the approach, or the effort isn't worthwhile. I didn't find this to be any harder than 5.4-5.5 at the time, but that's an "Old School" rating, too.

    Midway through pitch one, I came upon a fresh, hot, steamer the size and weight of a Texas cow turd. It is unknown whether this be the handiwork of herbivore or carnivore, but it was clearly not avian. It seems that avoiding these deposits of schitt makes one gravitate to the sparsely protected face to the left of the dihedral. Though runout, it is at least cleaner.
    Aug 29, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree with both previous entries: the climb is more 5.6, there is an abundance of (mostly avoidable) poop, and should possibly receive an 's' rating, due to the first pitch.  It's a really fun time, though, and the ledge at the top of the first pitch is very spacious and cool.     Eagle Rock does require a creek crossing, so keep that in mind, as it could affect your 'car-to-car' during the spring months.

    Great climb.  First pitch is an ugly traverse.  ZigZag from right to left until you get to a 2 bolt anchor on the face.  Then go straight up the face next to the dihedral (5.7) up to a huge ledge with a 2 bolt anchor.  Really fun pitch.  Pitch 3 go's straight up on huge buckets, and then finally getting into the dihedral crack for the final 20' to a 2 bolt anchor.  Rappel down or walk off the back.  Small rack.  Friends around #1-4, nuts from #5-10, 6 quick draws, and 3 slings.  Have fun!

    (pasted in from a comment by Dave Rivers) While we're pissin', I'd like to piss in the living room. Hank, I have your new 13a for you. It's Green Panther on Eagle Rock (equipped Rolofson, FFA Beal). IMO this route is soft. I worked it sporadically in the Fall of 2000 with some friends. My hardest redpoint at the time was Piles of Trials which I did that Fall. I had 3-4 one fall or hang attempts before school and a new career pulled me away from chasing the grades. I felt it might be 12c/d for me. I'm 6'2" with a positive ape index so that the "crux" throw was a subtle hip kip and deadpoint for me whereas my shorter but stronger friends had to full-on dyno. They redpointed the climb and also felt it soft for 13a ( and they tend to downgrade less than I). (end of paste)    My rating for this route is based solely on the fact that it took a few tries over two days, which is about average for me on most easy to mid-13 routes. If it feels soft for the grade, so be it. There are plenty of other options for harder climbing in Boulder Canyon.

    Merlin is spot on about traversing right to the tree before you start climbing up the buttress. The climb is very much like Pine Tree Route lower down in the canyon - relatively easy and low angle with OK to decent pro.  I didn't think it was that bad. Not to be missed is the final, steep handcrack that's short (sadly) and protects with a #3 Camalot.

    I'm not sure is this is standard or not, but I posted this route to let people know to skip it.  The climbing was dull, unaesthetic, and quite dirty.  We found a bouldering move on the route to add to the spice up top (v1 or v2?), but other than that, this route is pretty boring.      If you are a new leader, make sure to take the traverse under the roofs towards the obvious tree before heading up.  It might be a good first lead, and the views up top are nice, but otherwise steer clear.

    The moves up to the crux on this route are a great warm-up. HUGE holds up a great dihedral with some mellow stemming. The crux is way harder than the rest of the route. You will get to a small sidepull edge for your hand on the other side of the arret, and you will stuff your left foot into a slot. Drop your left knee and torque your foot hard. It will strongly seat your left foot and bring your left hip up and in so you can make a slow reach for an edge on a small, sloping shelf. A cool bouldering problem on a fun route. Loved it!

    I gave this route one star in a 5 star system in "Boulder Canyon Sport &amp; Adventure Climber's Guide - Volume II". I have been up the route, but I have not redpointed it. I have no intention of ever going back. This route is a good way to strain or injure your left shoulder on the crux. The crux is brief, then a few 5.11 jug moves finish. There is no anchor, unless you traverse right to Trustafarian Panhandler. Then someone must second it. Otherwise, you must downaid the roof, &amp; thread your rope through two of the bolts that have coldshut hangers to descend.    The route belays on the trail. Thrash through vegetation to get to the rock. Take caution getting to the 1st bolt, there is a loose block.    The best climbing is in the middle of the pitch below the roof. The climbing is 5.9 &amp; easier, even though one move may be harder. The rock is good, &amp; there are some interesting, fun moves in this section of the route.    The route name is far better than the route.

    I was hanging draws and loved this route until I tried clipping draws on the anchors. I am 5'5" with a +1 and I tried, oh I tried, for the life of me to reach.

    I agree that hanging the left draw on the anchor is a pain, hence, I hung the right, clipped in, and then pulled up to hang the left.  "One for the send, two for safety".  Not worth moving the anchors because it would only make cleaning harder.

    Sorry laid it on too thick about the # of ascents. I meant that I have never thought the anchor needed to be moved. BTW I am 5'6". That doesn't mean that I think it shouldn't be moved.

    Like I said in my previous post, I'm NOT suggesting anything.

At least the whip that they have taken is quite enjoyable since it's all air.

    @jarthur, I have done this route something like 50 times and have never used the crimp that fell off. There is a decent RH gaston/finger jam on the right that is secure enough to clip the anchor as it currently stands. Moving it is probably not necessary.

    There used to be a decent crimp to clip the anchors. However after doing this route yesterday and confirming with my partner it is definitely gone.

Sure, Steve D., myself and others would have put this route up differently, but we didn't.    As for Greaser and AC: Why is it when somebody like Steve brings up an issue with a route like this, you guys have to stick your fingers back in his face and give him grief about a different route he put up at a different crag, with permission from the FHRC? It gets us nowhere, but in his defense, Saturnalia is well bolted and a great route (in my opinion). NO LO is a pile. It's not the same line that was soloed. The bolts are in bad spots and it gets one star at best. Steve knows he is not perfect and is open to the idea of having the bolts removed if someone feels so inclined to apply to do so. I wish other first ascentionists felt this way.

I've said time and time again that I'm not opposed to bolts per se and I can give you examples of sport routes that I like but I doubt that would appease those who delight in simple-minded reductionism.     Regarding No Lo Contendre you can read my route description for the history and for Saturnalia I'd remind you that I didn't toprope it before leading it - I did some cleaning on rappel, I pre-placed a couple of RPs with long slings on them, and I worked it out from the bottom up. Then I got approval to place bolts where the RPs were clipped. Find fault with that all you want.    I've been somewhat surprised, over the past years, to hear from so many people who share my feeling that Boulder Canyon has become a disgrace. The good &amp; great routes are diminished by the too-close profusion of pointless, grid-bolted flotsam and jetsam. The sole purpose of too many routes seems to lie in "getting a workout" which, really, is available on any pull-up bar. A frenetically careless attitude leads to avoidable accidents  and new climbers learn bad habits and not good ones.    Maybe some day I'll come back here to read all the pithy insights and vapid humor, but for now I have better things to do.

    Bob - No argument there. We're all learning, I suppose. In trying to grapple with where S.D. is coming from, it was not hard to see his side of things. I guess, what I'd like to be able to do is to keep this broader view of things in mind all the time, and you're right I have not always done so. I'm also putting away a lot of very inflammatory things attributed to him. But part of my point in trying to balance the many things that come up when we put up new routes is that we all enjoy the "right" to express ourselves, however we choose, so long as we stay within legal limits.  There is a kind of anarchy to climbing as you well know, perhaps even more when put up new routes, and I think we need to hold on to that even if we don't staisify Steve or anyone else. But I can live with a little Steve gremlin perched on one shoulder asking whether that permanent bolt is indeed what we want to leave.

    Interesting thoughts, Richard.  I'm still a little unclear as to how Saturnalia and No Lo fit in wth Steve's constant and unrelenting position.  It seems like his unrelenting position, relents when there's a route he wants to do.  But he certainly appears to revel in telling the rest of the climbing community how they should act. Glass houses are still as fragile as ever.

    Steve Dieckhoff has been a constant voice in the climbing community for at least as long as I have been climbing myself (4 May 1980). In this entire period, he has expressed a constant opinion, and as near as I can tell he has never relented and has never hidden from his opinion.  He makes the point that placing a bolt trumps a trad placement, because it becomes a permanent feature of the landscape and asks the question "does placing a bolt confer a special right to permanently alter the landscape?"  He comes up with "no" as an answer.  There are least a few critical elements that require consideration in this complex and evolving issue. First, if placing a bolt on unrestricted rock is a "right" of the first ascensionists, then restoring the rock must necessarily be an equivalent "right".  Second, climbing has always held room for the climber to express their own creativity, and where this creativity does not infringe upon legal restriction it should be given unrestricted expression.  Third, what Steve wants, as best as I can determine, is for the first ascesionists to consider well the interests of the climbing community at large and to exercise respect for a limited resource.  There are, of course, a lot of things to consider in weighing these concerns, but surely he must be correct in this demand.  As far as Elanor is concerned, the climbing community has, in general, voiced little opposition to the bolts and the route can be climbed without clipping them all.  It's a fine route with brilliant climbing and Mark saw it best as a fully bolted line.  Is there anything here that we cannot live with?

    "Thanks for the doublespeak explanation, Steve. Let's see, another and even better example of doublespeak would be Saturnalia.

And lets not forget no lo contendere, which also poorly bolted rock that had been onsight soloed. What knd of special honor should we confer on you?"    Interesting...    Anyway, I've climbed this many times as it is a great warm up, and have never thought of it as a trad line. I generally don't clip the last bolt, and therefore, would not place gear in the short crack at the top. It is a sport route and a good one. I have no problem with it as it is.    By the way, there is a crack that goes in the .11+ range (next to Elanor) that was not bolted where gear can be placed. I think that demonstrates a reasonable descretion on the part of those to developed the area.     All of this sounds like nitpicking to me.

    Easter has about 25 routes (all bolted).     Elanor could be the odd single route requiring you to carry a rack so you can place 2 cams near the top.    Which means no one would do it , because most folks woudn't bring a rack to Easter Rock - you go there to clip bolts.     This route isn't Rincon or Country Club - I think you guys are making a mountain out of a molehill.     Good route on great stone.

    Yes, this is a typical example of doublespeak. On the one hand this is only a gym route (and gym routes are changed with regularity) but on the other there is supposed to be a special honor conferred on somebody who poorly bolts a piece of rock after top-roping it.  It's ironic that the "right of the first-ascentionist" is the one traditional right proclaimed, even when they really aren't a first-ascentionist at all but only a misguided routesetter.

    Ok, easy, guys. I'm not asking anyone to chop bolts. I was just curious to see what people think about bolts on top of clean pro. Maybe I used the wrong wording. I just don't think a bolt should be next to good clean pro. You can hate me for that if you wish.
    Jul 29, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Should this route be chopped? I propose that suggestions like this be made by people who are willing to sign their names as well. There is roughly 1/3 of the climb that is readily protectable with natural gear. The bottom crack, which is probably where Steve D clipped bolts, is mostly blind and/or thin with poor or no placements until after the second crux where the crack system opens up, . Then it's pretty easy up to the last crux where a good crack exists as well. Would it be as popular or as fun without bolts? Anyone interested can check out the crack to the right which gets done very infrequently despite its high quality and good gear. My suggestion to AC--go ahead and climb Eleanor without bolts or without a rope or in flip-flops, but otherwise keep the talk about route-chopping to himself, unless he's willing to identify himself.

    Agree with previous comments that it is a difficult onsight but a much easier redpoint. Beta: with small fingers, you can get a great two finger pocket jam at the crux, skip the low crimp, and with a high left foot slap the left hand up on the arete to the good crux crimp. Doing the move this way almost feels like neutering the route for me, because it really feels quite casual.

    Wonderful climb, great movement the whole way. Looks like there are a few ways people pull through the crux. If you're short, the hardest part of the climb may be at the slabbed out part before the third bolt.

    What he said ^.      spoiler*  Also, there's a great hands-free stance post crux (you can turn to your left and sit on your right foot on the ramp with your left foot wedged in the pocket on the face).

    Jun 12, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route is an absolutely mesmerizing line from the guidebook, the ground and especially  when clipping chains from the top...sometimes in your dreams.  The underlying beauty of this line comes in multiple facets:    Clipping the first bolt off of a bomber, in-cut, right hand jug with huge feet quells any minor concerns for safety.  Your first moves immediately after are not difficult but instead are just strenuous enough to let you know, "you're in it."    Moving up the arete uses powerful and sustained movement on holds that are good but that begin to take their toll and require thoughtfulness and balance, as well as a very tight core.  As your mental duct tape begins to come undone and your heavy breath becomes apparent, the voice in your head changes from "I'm going to send," to "damn... I'm pumped!?!"      THEN you look up and see the crux.      The sequence requires big moves off small holds to another small hold... a hard move I've seen done more than one way.  This challenging dead point move up to an in-cut, half pad crimp has to be accurate and controlled. Although this climb only has 7 bolts, it is deceptively long. All of the lateral movement involved adds an additional 30 feet, which only makes this one better.    As for the grade...I won't try to speculate on the difficulty.... If you climb 5.13, it's probably easy.  If you climb 511...it's going to feel really hard.... The point is that either way, this route is really fun and I highly recommend it to everyone. For those you you who like to have fun climbing...don't be discouraged by people who are too good to climb something that has a glued-on hold...they probably don't like having fun anyway....

    The glue doesn't bother me; the block in question is big enough that it would be quite a project to safely get it to the ground without going to the road and I also believe that the presence of the block makes the climb better.

    I've gotta say that despite the usual sport-crag atmosphere, Easter Rock is one of the best small crags, trad or sport, in the Boulder area.  This route in particular, I found to be one of the most enjoyable sport climbs in the Front Range.  As compared to other sport climbs of the grade, I think 12a is pretty much right on, though it is a one-move wonder kind of crux.      As to Tony's comment above, I don't want to necessarily start a debate on the comparison of sport and trad grades, but yes, it did feel slightly harder than the mid-5.11 cruxes of routes at Eldo like the Naked Edge, Climb of the Century, etc.  The difference though, of course, is that you're clipping bolts instead of dicking in RPs or purple TCUs as is typical of those Eldo climbs.  Though it is totally different in style, at Eldo Empire is maybe 11c/d?    a short 12a crux section

    Empire Of The Fenceless was the Easiest of the three 5.12's I did this weekend. I didn't want to confuse my comment regarding chipping with a grades argument though because I am not trying to bitch about the route in general.  It was very fun overall.    I was, however, trying to express that I was pretty pleased, and then bummed to see the glue.    As for the grade, I could have said 5.11b, but I've been getting a lot af flack for "sandbagging" lately, so I figured WTF- maybe I am having a good season...    Either that or there really is a big difference between Sport and trad grades.  Is Empire Of the Fenceless harder than the crux of The Naked Edge?  The Diving Board? Kloof (admittedly, a sandbag at 5.11a)? Not in my opinion.  Maybe the bolts being so close make me feel more secure and it is mentally easier, but I'd say it is not much harder than Gravity's Angel or Home Free either (both are 5.11b, sport).  Certainly this route did not feel as hard to me as Fuzzy Dice (5.12a sport) on Cadillac crag.

    I noticed the re-enforced block on the arete as well.  The rock that was glued on was obviously native and in place, but It looked junky and I was kinda bummed to see that.  Gee, my first "5.12" on-sight of the season and it turns out to be on a "borderline altered" route.    Folks, this is otherwise a great route, and would have still been one less that block as well.  Why not clean it instead of put a bunch of epoxy up there?  With the available holds for feet that are off to the left anyway, I don't think that the climb would have been substantially different without the glue.    If you feel that you have to glue something, please do so carefully and discretely, keeping the junk out of sight.

I think it is definitely more in the 12b/c range and would say that Ten Digit Dialing is harder than this route, but I'm just climbing to have fun, and it was a fun route...I'm just giving an opinion.

    This was the third sport route established at the crag in May 1995. I don't know how you can call it contrived or .12b/c. The final crux is the same as Nevermore, but getting to the last bolt presents an interesting dyno as well. After clipping 7th bolt, I make a big dyno with my right hand to the good hold to clip last bolt from. Yes, you could avoid this dyno by traversing more left &amp; doing this section the same way as Nevermore (.12a), but it feels run out enough I have always done the dyno. Cool move.  The problem with rating it .12b/c, or even .12c, is this climb is at least two letter grades harder than Tell Tale Heart. I noticed that you are rating Tell Tale Heart (.12b), Train 4 Life. To say this is only half a letter grade harder is absurd. I originally rated Tell Tale Heart .12a, but after watching many climbers slightly shorter than me struggle, I decided it should be rated .12b &amp; thus it was first guidebooked at that grade in 1996. So if you rate Tell Tale Heart (.12a/b), you could rate could rate Evermore (.12c/d). There are 8 bolts total.

    A contrived problem of what is on and off. Grades easier than Nevermore...I think this route is in the 12b range, maybe 12c! Basically no pump going into the crux and then a much easier way to get into it with basically a V4 move to the jug!

    Another good option is to climb the crux of Telltale Heart, move right above the roof, and hook up with Evermore. This link up is more sustained and flows like honey on hot cakes. Try and suppress the urge to lunge at the crux. Simply jack your right foot up to a good foothold and go all the way with your right hand. The left hand hold is bad (sloper) but body position make the move possible!

    Right knee pad helps w/ last two clips. Commenting as a really tall climber, any advantage one gains in one part of the route is later negated.

The hangers are totally fine, and the fixed draws are in good condition...maybe getting slightly weather worn but not in need of immediate replacement.

    "Flying Beast" has been one of my favorite routes in the canyon since I established it in 1995.  The reason that I gave the route a slash grade is because it is a very height- &amp; reach-dependent climb.  For me, it is 5.12d, not 5.13a because I am tall.  I find "Nevermore" to be just a bit harder, even though it could be rated 5.12d/13a as well. Slash grading makes a lot of sense to me.  It is easy to argue over grades, and as a guidebook writer, I have learned no matter hard you try, you will never please everyone.  When I look at a route's difficulty, I ask myself what's the hardest you would a climb &amp; what the easiest.  Is it soft for its grade or stiff?      As for fixed draws.  I never considered putting fixed draws on this route.  I have redpointed it at least 25 times &amp; cleaning it is not that bad.  I think some routes &amp; certain bolts should have fixed chain draws because cleaning them is extremely difficult or bad for your rope.  "Mighty Dog" in Clear Creek is one good example and I put the chain draws on that route.  It seems like more climbers want to turn the crags into an outdoor gym.  Today's redpoint style was yesterday's pinkpoint style.  If you have redpointed a route with the draws on it, the next way to up your performance is to redpoint the route 1st try of that day hanging the draws.  I have done this on "Flying Beast" a few times. Usually I have redpointed it second try, after a hangdogging up the route I place the draws.  That said I don't care that someone fixed draws on this route, but they do need some maintenance from time to time.    I can't imagine that the 1/2" Rawl 5 piece bolts need an upgrade, because this route sees very little rain down its ceiling.  I will take a look at the draws &amp; bolts soon however.  I have much experience replacing bolts, &amp; if any these bolts need replacing, they can removed and the same holes used again.  If you don't know how to do this, then don't bother replacing them, I will.

    I thought it was solid 11a. C'mon, people. Who cares what the grade is. 13a or 12d is more or less the same, remember? Great route nonetheless with some fun bouldery movements and some challenging clips with a fun finishing move which I couldn't seem to figure out for the life of me until someone showed me. As of 5-5-12, this route is in need of some fixed gear replacement. The very last fixed draw before the anchors which people seem to whip upon a lot is extremely worn on the side where it attaches to the hanger. Not sure if you're going to get this bugger off without a hacksaw. If I get around to it this summer, I plan on replacing the draws with steel permadraws, although the bolts and hangers look like they could use an update as well. Overall, still safe the way it is, but I give the last permadraw a couple more big whips and it's gonna snap off. So, I would hang your draw on that one until someone replaces it. Enjoy!

    Felt like a 13 to me, but whatever. Certainly seemed harder than anything else I've done at Easter, but notably a totally different style too.    It's nice that there are draws hanging on it. They were in pretty good condition as of 30 April, 2012. The last few clips are kind of tenuous, so be aware. They aren't really dangerous, just kind of unsettling.    Regardless of any grade controversy, this is a very fun route. One of the best in the area (unless you hate slopers).

    A very bouldery route, basically a 10-move V5 boulder problem with a couple hard clips, but this is nowhere close to 13a.  Maybe on the Boulder Canyon scale you could argue 13a, but at Rifle this would clock in at closer to 12c, even without the knee-bars or hip-scums, which I did not find.  Similar in difficulty to Nevermore, maybe a titch harder or easier depending on your strengths.

    The rockfall event referenced by mc kaiser was major - there was debris visible all around the base of the route today. The trail itself was damaged by the impact.

    I climbed this yesterday and changed the route forever. On the last lieback section I reached for a jug before a large ledge, and upon grabbing it, heard a faint creaking, and suddenly began to fall backwards with a large 6 x 4ish flake in my hands. Fortunately, I'm pretty large, and my belayer (thinking quickly) hopped up while my fall pulled him up and safely away from the rock fall zone. I only came away with a bruised leg and chest, and my partner was unscathed.   The scary part about this is that the flake looked totally solid and is very clearly the way the route went. It's now probably a letter grade or two harder. No bolts appear to have been impacted. Wear a helmet! Even if it's 'just' sport climbing.

    Definitely a low crux on this one and very technical, which doubtless lends heavy credence to its name! Be sure you have a good belayer, as a fall after the first bolt could mean a deck on the block. Very sustained movement afterwards, and largely a mental game! Breathe easy and finish strong!
    Aug 27, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Warm-up? Who on earth would warm-up on this one? Right from the get go, you have to reach high off a sketchy block to clip the first bolt, then crimp like hell off opposing side-pulls, grovel your feet left, pull hard and throw to a rounded bump with the right hand, then reach way out left, and continue on insecure verticalness to the top. My partner and I were quite pumped after this 2nd route of the day and felt ready to just go home (but we stayed to flail on more routes). Eleanor was more sustained for sure, but this had a more technical, insecure, and just plain weird start.

    Funny to see Elanor getting an 11+ rating and this route 11b on this site. I would agree with the 11 rating for this route. It actually feels harder than Elanor to me.

The ratings in Bolter Canyon sure are wacky... But then BC is its own world.

    Aug 24, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    In response to Jay Samuelson not understanding the anchor placement: Evermore was established before Nevermore, &amp; the anchor works good for it. Secondly, I did not want someone doing Tell Tale Heart to go to this anchor. Climbers can climb Evermore &amp; Tell Tale Heart at the same time, but not if they mistakenly arrive at the same anchor. Thirdly, before drilling, I always hammer tap the rock to make sure it is solid &amp; not hollow sounding. I can't remember if this could have a factor.  As for cleaning, it seems that gyms have raised some very strong climbers whose technical skills are a bit lacking. Try tramming to the rope with a single biner attached to your belay loop rather than a draw. I do use a draw but clip the rope biner directly to the loop, so I am into a single biner to the rope versus clipping the bolt biner into the belay loop &amp; rope biner into the rope. The commom second method is a good way to pinch the skin on your bicep between rope &amp; biner or your breast, ladies. Tramming in short generally avoids skin or nimble loss &amp; keeps you in closer. Try it on the steepest overhang. It works.   Lastly, I don't usually clean the first bolt when lowering. I climb back up from the ground to retrieve it afterwards.
    Jun 30, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Definitely one of my all time favorites. Tell Tale Heart was the first sport route on the crag, followed by Elanor, then Evermore (the easier way to get to the same crux from Elanor), then Empire Of The Fenceless, then Flying Beast. After that, I put up Nevermore in July 1995. I had the crux move wired doing it on "Evermore" but fell just shy on the horizontal jug break for almost 5 days on Nevermore. I had to find a better way to dyno this crux. I finally redpointed it on day 6. After the first ascent, I repeated it numerous times that summer. I have probably redpointed it 20 times between 1995 &amp; 2004. I have thought it could be rated 5.12d/13a. I am tall, &amp; it feels like .12d in good cool conditions, but I have done it so many times it isn't fair to call it anything but .13a (what I originally rated it).   I love the flow of the moves on this climb &amp; the aggressive crux dyno. Best day at this crag has been sending Elanor, Flying Beast, Nevermore, The Penguin, &amp; Empire Of The Fenceless. That's a good day.

    What a great route! It just keeps getting better and better as you climb higher and higher, climaxing with an awesome deadpoint to a mega-jug!

    Things to know if you want to do this route to beef up your 8a scorecard, or just your spraysumé, and aren't the type to just climb for the experience of climbing:     &gt; Crux finale seems stout for the shorter climber using the right-hand-crimp method. Heel hooks are NOT mandatory at the crux.   &gt; Basically feels like climbing a solid 5.12a followed by a 5-to-6-move V5.   &gt; I'd say it was soft if I hadn't missed the finishing jug a half-dozen times already. Beware.   &gt; My buddy who did Sonic Youth (5.12d/13a) found this to be more difficult, in that Sonic took him fewer tries.   &gt; I think this route does favor the power climber, since the climbing leading up to the crux is pretty easy, especially when you get it dialed.

    Certainly, a memorable route &amp; one I have repeated several times since Alan &amp; I made the first ascent on September 16, 2000. We originally rated it 5.12a, but I think it isn't quite that hard, &amp; I call 5.11d. The moves past the 2nd &amp; 3rd bolt on pitch 2 are the crux, but the redpoint crux is the finish. Lots of 5.11 climbing on pitch 2. I find it slightly more difficult than Elanor (which I have pretty wired). I would say they are the same grade.    The moves at the start of pitch 1 have always felt like solid 5.11 &amp; involve some awkward stemming. The first 2 bolts are close, &amp; I don't remember thinking the clip to the 2nd bolt was a big deal.    As for combining the two pitches into one, it isn't something I've ever done.  The sloping ledge atop pitch 1 is a great rest. It is nice to have good communication with your partner on the 2nd pitch, so I would recommend doing the climb in two pitches.

    I saw the bottom boulder problem done three different ways. The way I did it involved stemming, creative footwork, small crimps, and went no harder than V2. It was easy enough to clip the bolts. Overall, a really good route when the pitches are combined and a good second warm-up after Road to Emmaus. Use extended alpine draws or long runners on some of the bolts when linking up P1 &amp; P2. Plenty of rope left with a 70. A 60 might just make it to the ground.

    In August 2000, I actually did more than just equip this climb. I redpointed to where I was able to grab the right anchor (.12c). My intent was not to stop here but to traverse more left to the jug on the lip of the giant overhang. Here the anchor can be clipped. So I took the right anchor bolt out &amp; put a new left anchor bolt in. The original left bolt becoming the right, so you couldn't end the route this way. I then added the last protection bolt which is a hard clip. The last moves to the jug are quite hard. I was never able to do them. I haven't been on it for years, but I am surprised to see it rated only .12d. The finish seemed more like 5.13. I had no problem letting Peter get the FFA. I had enough of the bat shit flake.

A 70M rope will lower to the ground from the top. I think a 60M might work for the lower, too, but I haven't tried it. It makes for a pretty fun, long pitch and a good warm up for the crag. Take 16 draws.

    This was the first sport route established at this crag in May 1995. I originally rated it .12a. For me, it is much easier than Plan B or Joyride. It was only after watching many good shorter climbers struggle &amp; call it 5.12 that I decided to rate it .12b. Shorter climbers climb the crux differently making more moves. This route was the beginning of a long, wonderful summer of putting up new routes at the crag.

    Classic route in my opinion though a bit polished. I think that's to be expected though in Boulder Canyon. The crux moves are pretty devious if you end up getting suckered into moving too high into the corner under the roof. Also a note on the anchor - there are not cold shuts, only chains at the top of this route currently. 8 bolts, plus two for the anchor.     The moves at the top are a bit... peculiar. My partner and I both went straight up, not right, by using a bit of dynamic force. There are some holds there to use.

    Great Route, although I wouldn't give it four stars. It was a bit polished and fairly juggy with the exception of the crux section. It's a hard onsight too without having any beta, the heavily chalked holds split at the crux and can be a bit deceptive.  Super fun though.... I don't think you can compare to Discipline, The Shaft, or Joy Ride which are all true 4 star 12b's in the area. Get on them if you haven't!!!!

    One of the better sport routes in the Canyon.

    This is a fantastic route, but was I missing something up by the anchors?  I had a hard time finding any holds at all about 5 feet below the anchors (well above both cruxes).  I was probably just blind from lactic-acid buildup...
    Jan 1, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Re: Pete Franzen's comment.    I am sure that you found this in the end. However, a good stance for getting to the anchor can be had by cutting right around those rounded bulges, about ten feet below the anchor. You pick up good hands, and by staying cool can quickly step back left, over the bulge and right below the anchor. It turns out to be a good stance for clipping the anchor. I thought that the crux was also a bit circuitous. Cut hard left around the roof, and take scary move back right over the roof for a clip. Still, this is a great route and worth the effort to figure out.

    A few things: first, this is a great route, do it.     Second, the fixed nut at the roof popped on me. I placed 0.4 equivalent below it, so it wasn't a big deal. I didn't replace the nut. It's unnecessary and detracts from the route in my opinion.    Third, the anchors need a bit of work. There are two bomber bolts that are equalized with chain to a single quicklink holding a rap ring. This is the definition of not redundant. I added some cord and a biner, but what is really needed is some chain and another rap ring. I'll try to fix it next time I'm up there, in the mean time, don't steal my cord and biner.    Finally, when cleaning be careful. I unclipped my tram and had a really bad encounter with a tree. The best thing to do is have someone follow, but if that isn't possible: clean to below the roof with a tram, lower to the ground with the tram still on, pull the rope so you have a stick clip through the remaining pieces, climb up to the last piece, and then downclimb, cleaning as you go. If anyone has a better way to clean, I'd love to know.    Also, I didn't meet any bats.

    Really phenomenal, bonafied 4 stars. There are several constrictions of various sizes in the roof crack at the crux that serve excellently as opposition finger locks for the move to the finger jam above the roof, and then a sinker heel hook below the roof keeps your hips in for the lock off move to the jug. Great, great, great.

    Really good crack route, particularly for Boulder Canyon.  I thought it was right up there with Country Club, etc. in terms of quality.  Good rock, good protection, steep, cool temps on a summer evening.  What more could you ask for?    In terms of difficulty, I thought 12a seemed pretty accurate.  It was similar to other 12a's I have been on at Vedauwoo, Platte, BC, etc.  That being said, I am generally better at enduro routes than bouldery power routes, such as this one.  Gear is straightforward and not strenuous or pumpy, so it basically boils down to hammering through 3 or 4 tough moves.  Tough one to onsight, as there is almost too much stuff to work with.
    Jul 10, 2009

    Amazing route. Thunderdome is pretty moderate before and after the crux, but the crux moves felt like solid 12a.  My beta seemed different from everyone else's here so the best advice I have is just to get out there and figure it out for yourself. You'll likely have it to your lonesome even on sunny summer weekends. Isn't it great bringing trad gear to a sport crag.
    Jun 24, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Given how some of the sport routes here gets more than 3 star average, I'm hesitant to give this 3 stars, but I think that's all it deserves. It does not have a crack crux or any sustained hard crack section.    I hung &amp; fell at the crux (I was already pumped from a couple sport routes) before figuring out it was a bouldering problem, not a finger crack crux. Still, this feels at most 11+ for somebody with strong arms. At any rate, the protection is pretty straightforward and falls from the crux or above are clean.

    Interesting to see the upgrading for this. I did this again today for the second time. The first was about five years ago. I haven't placed much gear recently and would say that if you know what you're doing placing pro, this shouldn't be too epic. It took a long time to figure what gear should go where, like placing a #1.5 Friend in the key jam at the crux and then having to take it out and leave room for my hand. Fortunately the crux is brief and the rest of the climb is littered with jugs. On the other hand, I did Nevermore, Flying Beast and Catwoman on the same visit and they felt much easier overall.

    Fabulous route.  One of the best trad climbs of its grade in the Boulder area.  Powerful crux.  I thought Chris Peisker led this on the FA.

    You asked for beta so here's what I did:  at the roof, there's a decent thin left hand jam, thumbs up, which allows you to move way out right to stick a good right hand side pull thats well-chalked.  I toe-hooked my left foot in the crack to help out on balance while reaching for that right hand, that move is fun, wild, and probably 11+.  Next, get the right foot around the corner to the right on a decent hold, then left foot onto a higher sloper horizontall just under the roof, and set up for a BIG reach to a jug, the crux move.  I had to dyno to get it, but it's quite good.  From there, make sure NOT to put a cam in the hand jam in front of you (as I've mistakenly done) or it will be very hard to climb past it without the jam.  Use a nut or go a little higher before pro'ing. Excellent 5.10 or easy 5.11 climbing from there to the top.

    As the description says, the original rusted 3/8" stud bolt with rusted, thin SMC hanger has been replaced. The threads were stripped on the stud and the nut glued, but the whole bolt spun with the nut itself when trying to loosen the nut, which prevented being able to remove the nut as well as the bolt itself and thus preventing reusing the same hole. The new bolt location is a little closer to the arete, which makes it actually a touch easier to clip on the lead. Anyway, thanks to the Boulder Climbing Community for providing the bolt. Please support them if you don't already.

    Another fun TR from the Electra Glide anchors is the "Goof Roof", which lies between the two climbs. Not really worth wasting the metal on to establish it as an independent line, but there are super fun roof moves to a delicate slab which eventually joins the upper crack of E.G. at about 10+ to 11-.
    Aug 12, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    June, 2010: Well worth trying on TR, but considerably harder than 9+, me thinks. I was looking and saw little opportunity for pro above the roof, with the exception of behind the tiny little flake, which as mentioned, moves when you pull on it. If you can get past that, there is a marginal slot above that that would take a piece, then the huge flake above that, which also moves when you put weight on it. I'd recommend just leading Electra-Glide then TR this from the tree, and even on TR this is quite a challenging "Yosemite-style" set of moves.

    As Tony mentions, most/all of the gear in the upper crux section is placed in contact with a large, long flake or two that sound kind of hollow with the flake expanding possible.  I thought one or two placements in the crux might have held a fall but still wouldn't want to test it out...    There are rap slings in the tree at the top of the climb to descend.
    Jul 17, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The flake at the crux, which is your ONLY opportunity for pro has a 1/8 to 3/16 inch crack behind it, but flexes ~1/4 inch. If you were to fall on pro behind it you might turn a loose flake into a death flake (fall on you). There is good protection below the roof that would keep you off of the ground, so make sure you get it and then run it out a little- and be SURE you are solid at the grade.

    Nice addition, Mark! I really enjoyed this traverse. I found the crux to be about V1 for a couple moves, but most of the traverse is much easier. There are definitely ways to make this harder if so desired. It's a great place to get a quick workout without pads or a partner. I added what I creatively dubbed "Center Route" (V0) to this wall, which I found to be a great line also. Center Route has top out holds, but the other possible lines may require some insecure mantle moves to top out from what I could see at the top. I may bring pads up here at some point to explore the other lines I was checking out on this wall. Does anyone know if there are any established lines on here? I don't think I have ever seen this boulder in a book or anything.

Bomber pro the whole way, but most of it seemed to be the same size (0.4-0.5 C4s or medium nuts, or small tricams).  Excellent belay ledge up top with bomber pro and a great view.

We started a bit lower than the red line in the Mtn Proj picture above, but veered left of the red line during our climb to stay on more vertical rock.  There are so many cracks on this portion of the rock, you could climb it in dozens of ways.

I kind of liked the route, relatively clean, and was amazed in all the years I'd lived there I had not done.     I agree with Phil that if you scheme to stay more left more on the upper part (slabs) as I did, it seemed a bit harder than 5.6.    I have to say I was a bit bummed before I read this post as that step across gave me a "sh*t...this is 5.4??" feeling.    I thought it was kind of a pretty steep-slabby type line.

    This is a decent route, and I would recommend it as an excellent beginner trad lead. There are pro opportunities everywhere and the length is good for a first lead. The climbing felt like 5.5 or less to me.    A pink (0.5" I think) Camp tri-cam works perfectly at the horizontal crack at the crux in the middle of the route.    IMHO the standard route on the third buttress or the Owl/Cozyhang or even East Slab are substantially more fun in the area.

    Can't say as if I have any info on that first pitch as you describe it, but the first time I went up to do MM my partner didn't like the ledge fall and bailed out to the right.

I'll have to see if P1 is one of the things Jason and I did when we went up there to "do the rest" in 2012.  That's when we did the "Undocumented roof" and saw GG and documented that as well.  Jason did sketches of everything, but I just took a few pics for later reference and went from that.

    Thanks, George, for the info and the history on this line. I assumed that someone had climbed sections of this line in the past... After cleaning and excavating many important placements, I wondered...? After the large roof on the left that we climbed, the diagonal seem trending rightward was choked with dirt and moss to the point that it didn't appear any one had ever placed gear there before... Now it has been cleaned and takes good nuts for protection. I also cleaned the classic corner section above of dirt, grass, and bushes.... This is when I thought that this line had possibly not been climbed before....   After reading Tony B's description of Mickey's Mantel, it seems the start is the crack/corner feature 15' to the right of the pumpy roof that we climbed. Then, the top of the 1st pitch at the belay ledge/cave, "Mickey's Mantle"  pulls the dramatic, steep, "ledge fall potential" roof out the left side of the "cave belay" and into the obvious thin crack above. We instead climbed the arching, right-facing corner above the belay ledge that took some obvious cleaning too (which may have been climbed or not???). We chose to finish up with the dihedral around the back, and that seemed to have seen some traffic in the past.  Overall, the line that we climbed is quite classic and really fun, especially after some much needed cleaning! I'll have to climb the start to the right sometime. I would recommend climbing the arching corner instead of the wild, "barely protected, ledge-fall "Mantle" above the belay ledge. Many different variations exist for this classic line....

    Pretty bouldery and stiff start to this one if you opt to tackle the face directly, without stemming.  Getting off the ground and into the route was the crux for me, and then some great 10 moves followed until getting up on the slab.  The R section comes about half way up the route and involved some balancey 5.9 moves.  I followed this one, so I can't vouch for how scary a lead it was, but it didn't seem too bad.

    A neat route, with long legs you can avoid the 10c crux with some serious back stemming in the chimney. The face up above is spooky and committing, but way cool. Expect some lichen and not much chalk to guide the way.

It's infested with lichen and slippery when wet, but the climbing is excellent, the pro is good, and the position is superb. If only it got more traffic...or a good brushing. Do your part.

    This definitely did not disappoint! We TR'd it with the idea of climbing the main route and variation. but halfway through, a typical Boulder 50-60 mph gale force wind came ripping through the canyon in advance of a snow storm tomorrow, so we only did the main route. We took a slightly different line from that of the Beta photo: about 15 feet from the top we cut back right about 5 feet into the visible cleft which ends at the top, which was slightly climber's right of the chain (seemed plenty solid BTW - we used it as a backup along with several primary anchors). This flared jam seemed like it might be a little harder than the Beta photo line. Beautiful route with great sticky footholds and sharp face holds appearing when needed and perfect jams up above!

    Fabulous. Heady lead for someone not strong at the grade. First 20 feet coming off the big ledge are best protected with offset cams. It would be tough to safely lead that section without them. After that, the climbing is mostly in cracks and sustained with great gear.

    High gravity day??? I don't know, but I had a tough time with this 5.8. Once you leave the horizontal ledge, the next 20 feet aren't super well protected... flaring a bit. Gear is solid above that, but it's plenty sustained. Great one with really nice exposure. Reminded me of P2 of Over The Hill in Eldo.

    There is a chain (just one) cemented into the rocks at the top of this route. Since there are cracks in the cement and I can't inspect the attachment anyhow, I wouldn't rap from it.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route is fun for sure. Some will disagree, but I don't think I would recommend this for someone just breaking to the 5.8 grade. The first section of the route does not protect great. Most of the cracks are too shallow/flared to get a good downward facing cam into.     It is also extremely important to consider rope drag. I ran into some problems when the rope was feeding through a crack below me. This made the final 30' quite difficult. It's an awesome climb, but one that you should definitely take seriously. Doubles in #2, 0.75 were helpful. I think a 0.3 and 0.4 would also be worth having since my standard rack ends at 0.5.
    Apr 18, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The water pipe has a hole in it that fountains right next to the start (if you're starting from the ground).      Rather than get wet, we moved ~50 right, just left of the corner to a nice ledge.  There is some crappy rock for ~20ft off the ground that leads to good, left trending, thin cracks.  These cracks go up to a bush, that connects to the route after its traverse.  This variation felt like 5.7+ S, the S being for the poor rock at the start, but the moves are enjoyable.
    Jun 8, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I disagree with previous comments. This route protects very, very well, particularly once the traverse is completed. The difficult sections can all be sewn up appropriately. I would strongly recommend this route to those breaking into 5.8. The climbing is straightforward, the gear is great, and the rock is pretty steep! Furthermore, the climb is varied and sustained; what else could one ask for?

    It's also fun to start this route up the left-leaning splitter of Zolar Czakl (also a great climb) just above &amp; right of the step off the pipe. Climb to the overlap/roof of ZC and traverse right across nice flakes, with occasional good gear. Then link into the 5.9 variation of NW face. Cool wall! Don't forget to boulder the tasty 30' 5.7 splitter in the short wall above the 4th Elephant.
    Sep 25, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Really fun climb.  A couple of notes:  pro up to the detached block in the middle of the climb is a little sparse.  This could be very scary if you're just breaking into leading 5.7/5.8 trad.  Be prepared (guidebooks never seem to prepare you for this stuff).  Also, the traverse into the climb (starting at the pipe) is a little sketchy.  Do your best to protect the second, as a fall here could result in quite a ride.

    Did his today. Great climb on a mild January day. Mental crux (especially for shorter folks) might be the step across from the pipe to get onto the rock.

The tunnel was dry as of today and made for an easy return.

    Jun 19, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Set a good anchor behind the belayer so that a leader fall on the first traverse move won't pull them off the pipe and over the ledge.  A small nut high in the crack after the first traverse move will protect the second from a ground fall.  A tri-cam works for the start of pitch two.  Very satisfying climb!
    Jun 3, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A quality, good length pitch that offers positive holds, good stemming and placements.As mentioned above, a few slightly flared cracks down low can be protected with small aliens if you don't own offset cams.  Most of the climb is 6 or 7 until above half way where the angle of the route increases.  Here a section of hand and foot jams takes you thru what I felt was the 8 crux not too far from the top. Many different variations are possible on this face as cracks are galore. This climb is fun and well worth your time.
    Oct 16, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Steep, continuously interesting, varied climbing; one of the best 5.8s in Boulder Canyon.  Three stars.  Make sure you have Aliens or TCUs to protect the initial vertical section; offset Aliens would work really well here.  Watch out for poison ivy on the descent; the worst of it can be avoided by angling left onto rock instead of going straight down toward the tunnel.  The tunnel was dry, with one small wet spot, on 8/10/02.  A good summer climb since it's in the shade until mid-afternoon.
    Aug 10, 2002

    This is a fun and challenging route.  We TR'd it and had a great time with the various route variations.  The TR setup is very straightforward with many blocks on top to set up your anchor system.  You will need a 60 meter rope to reach the pipe.  The tunnel is dry and provides great access to the east side of the buttresses.

    I suspect that the lower part of "GG" had been led before the two bolts were installed.  Furthermore, the 10b second pitch described in Drew's comment seems to be the upper part of Endgame (FFA: Jim Erickson, solo, 1973).      In the route description of "GG" (above), Tony refers to Endgame as an obvious finish. The upper half of the green line in the beta photo is definitely on Endgame.  I've led it.

    I think this pitch is 5.11a past the 2 bolts and up through the final roof before easing off. Climb up and right to the nice ledge at the base of the green lichened pillar above....  Climb up the right-leaning, thin hand crack (ENDGAME), and step left up under the roof. A small cam (1/4") protects the exciting face moves on huge jugs (5.9+) to gain the continuing crack above (ENDGAME). The GREEN GARGOYLE start and the ENDGAME finish provides for a beautiful 2 pitches, 5.11a, 5.10b.

    The climbing is well worth doing if you come down from the top after another climb (we did Northwest Face, which is terrific).

    2 cents on the approach scramble:  It's really not that bad, if you take your time, and pick out the path of least resistance.  If you are concerned, put on your climbing shoes first.  Don't be deterred by this alone.     To get down, the rappel off the pine tree is also straightforward to get to.     Oh, and the climb itself was fun, but was much more of a face climb than a crack climb, i.e. not too many jams.
    Sep 6, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'd like to applaud the sentiment of the previous post. Difficulty is rarely synonymous with danger. The class 4 approach is long and steep and hardly seems worth the risk for a 30 foot pitch. If you want to climb easy stuff without a rope, why bother bringing the gear to do the crack?
    Aug 3, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Looking up from the bike path or road, the upper face looks angled enough that you might guess its a romp up the crack, but don't be fooled.  Its steep, and might feel harder than 5.9 at the crux on your first attempt. I've done this route 3 times now and it never gets easier, but always stays fun. There is a good hold out left, at the crux, that is easy to overlook, but allows advancement of the left foot high enough to get thru the little bulge in the middle of the face.  Lots of foot smearing required, but the rock is excellent. Although the climb is short, I enjoy the sustained nature of the climbing on this route.  My favorite climb on the Elephant Buttresses.

    And the Naked Edge can be climbed with nothing but a chalk bag.  Knock yourself out, kiddo.  But that's really not the point.  It just seems more pleasant to rappel than scrambling up with hands-and-feet-needed terrain with "varied ability" partners.

    A good way to access this climb without the spooky class 4 is to climb any one of the fine routes leaving the waterpipe (Monster Women P1 roof to Mojo Rising P2 corner?) that puts you on top of the buttresses.  Scramble 'round back and set up an anchor on top of the Second Butrress and rap down to the belay shelf (no cheating!).      On a side note, I was thinking as I scaled the immaculate face how in another era (ours) and in another place (sport park) this route would have been bolted to save time fishing stoppers into the small crack at the crux.  Leading this clean is an honor and a bolt would certainly detract from the experience. (This tirade is not intended to give the impression that this climb is difficult to protect with gear, on the contrary, and my point) Now that I'm spouting my opinions, I think other climbs I have not done that I could experience on gear (and let me make that distinction clear: runnouts are ok if they fall comfortably below the climb's crux pitch, but boy do I love bolts on rock like the Monestary) would fulfill me more.  Just a note to anyone with first assenssionist's fever and a bolt gun.

    Actually, this crack can also be aided on lead AND Top Rope at C1.  The anchor at the top can be a double length sling around a horn. Less than vertical slope and easy placements make this an awesome introductory aid climb.  I'd recommend doubling up on stoppers 11-13, TCUs (not FCUs) .5 or .75, and maybe a #3 Camalot along w/slings for tiny horns.  Be careful though, the top chockstone is hollow as shit so don't spend too much time on it. And finally NO PINS!!

    Seems like the one move at the headwall with the hand crack that widens in the back is harder than 5.5, and quite a bit harder if you're short.  At 5'11", I was stretching for the bomber hold up and left.  Great pro though.  I was practicing with hexes, and placed all 3 I had borrowed.  One sling, and one thin (aluminum I think) rap ring on the tree, but the walk off up top was easy.  Fun route!

    I was looking for something casual on the Elephant Buttresses (and something in the shade) and found this one.  Pretty straight-forward, with a couple of bulgy moves where height doesn't hurt; my 5'5" wife had a lot of trouble with the first bulge.  10' below the tree, I headed far to the right on an airy, thin ledge which added a nice finish to the route.  Still no rap slings, but the walk-off through the tunnel is easy and lots of fun!

    Don't forget the irrigation tunnel if you want a second  alternative for an easy walk off, water or no water.  If someone needs to bail off of EB, let them leave some gear.  Things can get pretty desperate up there when a storm blows in.    Anyone could leave some slings if they had to rappel off the tree and found no slings, so it isn't making it more dangerous....

    The walk-off between the Elephant Buttresses and the Dome is casual and not very far.  The slings wear away the tree and could/will eventually kill it. There is no reason for a rap station to be there.    casey

    As of 8/15/05, someone has removed the rappel anchor (multiple slings and two rap rings) from the tree atop this route.  I hope to get back here later this week and replace the anchor.      I wonder why someone would do this?  Pine Tree Route is a standard rap route; these weren't bail slings.  The 4th-class downclimb between the 2nd and 3rd Elephant Buttresses is tricky and exposed; not a pleasant alternative.    I wish the people responsible for this would act in the spirit of service to the climbing community instead of making things more difficult and dangerous for others.

    This is a good route-fun!    You can reach safe ground, barely, with a 50m rope from the tree.
    May 26, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A good choice for a beginner leader though will make the beginner think in places, takes a variety of pro well. The route does end at a Pine Tree with some rappel rings, but perhaps a better choice for belaying your second is to sling the huge flake a few feet behind the tree. (this can also be backed up with pro) this puts you in a more solid position for belaying rather than hanging off the tree.
    Jul 27, 2003

    Fun climb !!! Good beginner route, plenty of pro and good holds. About 10 feet below the pine tree, there is a choice of two crack systems.... I thought the right-hand option was easier.

    This is a good warm-up/beginner route since the angle is less than vertical and all the jams/jugs are bomber. I led it with 1 set up to 2.5" and was ok. Unless you follow a straight line here, bring long slings and place judiciously to avoid rope drag hell. Do it in the winter w/a pack for an alpine feel.

    I liked this route but would note that it's probably a little more difficult for those with big fingers. There were several moves I had to complete without getting more than my tips in the crack. I'd call it 10b in this circumstance.    It's worth noting as well this route protects ridiculously well with 0.4-0.75 cams and offset nuts.

    For a three star variation at possibly 5.10a/b, step out onto the face to your right after finishing the finger crack section in the dihedral above the initial roof, and follow the challenging and awesome zig zag finger/tips crack to the shared finish with Classic Finger Crack.

    For what it's worth, I thought this was harder than Cosmosis just up the road. I think Cosmosis is overall a better climb than this, but this route certainly had a harder crux move over the roof into some more sustained climbing. All in all, this is a great route and protects so nicely.

    Approached via a finger crack roof directly below and left of TS. Prolly went at 5.9. Does anyone know if this is a route?

I will probably always use this route from here on out to get up there.

    Nothing like seeing two of your coworkers you have never seen climb before solo this before attempting an onsight, it got me fired up though for the send! Easiest way to approach is def the 4th class from the water pipe, my wife leads 6 trad and had no problem soloing to access this route, it only takes a few minutes and WELL worth it, my vote for best route in area.
    Oct 6, 2006

    Took me a few trips to send this one, I thought this went at 5.9+ at the crux.  I also thought the climbing was sustained 5.8+/5.9- up the rest of the crack.  The rests seemed thin and for me; it was an endurance race to see if I could make the top without burning out.  But, I was probably placing too many pieces as I was nervous after seeing that guys ankles, ouch!  That said, great climb, but it's not over after the crux!

    This is a short route with great moves.  My partner and I both enjoyed this route more than Classic Finger Crack to the right.  I felt this climb was definitely harder than 9+, but I'm also 5'4".  I found the easiest way to reach the base of the climb from the top of the second buttress is to downclimb easy terrain to the rappel tree between the second and third buttress.  Then, traverse west and down to the gully that can be used in the approach from the water pipe.  Continue up this gully to the base of the climb.

The pro's a little weird below the roof, but you can sew up this climb if you want to (which you can see that I did in the pictures below).

    After TRing this a few times over the years, finally sent this on lead the other day. Its often wet and slippery in the crack under the roof.  Get a solid left hand hold high in the vertical crack underneath, then reach up and lock the right hand into the crack at the outside edge of the roof while stemming out on the face with the right foot. Then crank over moving the right foot higher onto a good ledge and left onto the roof top.  This move can be a tough situation for shorter folks with thinner hands. Fun (7)ish crack climbing above this unless you move out onto the arete or hook it up with CFC to the right which is harder. Sews up well with 1" &amp; 2" cams.

    This climb is really just a one (grunt) move wonder.  Put one hand in the perfect jam, stem up and you are over the roof.  5.9 tops.  The rest of the climb is nice, but much easier.  I thought Classic Finger Crack (originally rated 5.8) was more technical and harder because the stances for placing pro seemed more tenuous.
    Aug 21, 2002

    From a ledge half way up this beauty, one can make an airy step around right and gain a beautiful thin crack that joins the last moves of the Classic Finger Crack. Interesting moves, bomber blue Alien. I love this little cliff!

    An excellent line. The feet really are not as good as they may appear from below. I think this route is about mid 5.10 perhaps a/b. Also a better approach than coming up the gully is just as the second buttress starts you will see crack going over a little bulge, layback this crack (a little dirty on feet) and approach the base of the route via a flake that runs just left of an arete and then up a slab. I give this line 2 stars and the Tough Situation 3 stars.

    On June 3, 2010, Michele Beaty and I did what might be either a new route or a combination of routes to the top of the 4th Elephant Buttress.    We began climbing 15 feet to the right of the start for Monster Woman.  It was unprotected but moderate in difficulty up a right-facing dihedral, and I could place a good cam.  A bit further I clipped an old 3/4 angle piton with a broken eye.  From here, I went straight up through corners and discontinuous cracks and flakes until I got to a spot where I had to make a few balancy moves (the crux at 5.10b?) left and up to a finger crack.  The remainder of the pitch was easy and finished just below the top.  Walk off right to the top of the gully.    We grade this at probably 5.10b, 110 feet.  A standard rack up to a #3 Camalot and a rack of nuts with a few long runners suffices to protect this route.

    2 pins and 2 fixed stoppers currently on this route. The 2nd pin is somewhat dubious, easily backed up with a 1" cam. Bizarre, unique, awkward, powerful, wonderful climbing.     For what it's worth, I stayed in the right dihedral of the double dihedral system. I didn't really find it necessary to step into the left dihedral system save for the very last move onto the good stance before the 5.9 climbing to the top. Perhaps a little hard for 11c?

    We TR'ed this with a gear anchor at the very top of the cliff and a 70m rope.  We belayed on a ledge right below the first crux.  It felt ok without an anchor for the belay; however, there is still another 25' or so to the ground, so be careful. Tie knots in your rope rappelling, and add some directionals up until just past the crux.      Fantastic climbing, but seeping wet a couple days after a big snowstorm.

    A brilliant climb with some unusual movement! The crux is steep and strenuous, placing the pro is half the battle!    If you have successfully reached the ramp above the crux corners and you are still wanting for some more then try this extension - work up and left around some huge detached blocks until you can step out left above the big roof, find a bolt runner and some cool face climbing (5.10+) which leads up an exposed headwall, follow finger and hand cracks to the top.

    I remember clipping a number of fixed nuts and pitons on this climb a few weeks ago, but there are only the piton below the crux and another fixed nut higher up on the crux now. A green Alien will protect the traverse crux well.

    I went up to FM today with a hammer, chisel, and a selection of pitons with the hopes of clearing away and replacing the piton that broke on me a few weeks ago.  As soon as I got a good look at remainder of the pin, I realized there was no hope in replacing it.  The pin broke off well inside the crack and reaching it was near impossible, so the hammer and chisel were never put to use.  I did notice a good stopper placement a few inches above the pin and a very good cam placement above that, so the route is still well protected through the crux, you'll just have to work a little more for it.

    I got out in a really wide stem and was able to switch my hands into the dihedral with no problem. This made getting into the fingerlocks pretty easy, meaning the crux for me was the steeper climbing below. I have really long legs however, so this might not be feasible for everyone.

    A fairly bold lead on really cool features with some questionable flakes. There is good gear to be had, but it is not always where you want it. Climb this in the shade. I almost greased off a few times in the hot sun! We built a small anchor on the ledge with the two smallest offset Mastercams, placed two offset DMM nuts early in the corner, a yellow-blue offset Mastercam with a long sling above that, clipped the bolt (although some small nuts or RPs could protect the moves adequately), placed a C4 0.5 next to the stuck Friend (although yellow-orange offset Mastercam would have been easier to clean and even more bomber), and then got a #2 and #1 C4 in the undercling traverse. Make sure you take a good look at the gear in the undercling traverse. The crack is quite flared with some more parallel spots. Gear will rip from flared placements, and you will traverse a ways to the left and up on nontrivial climbing before you can get more good gear in.  Felt like solid (hard) 10+ in the hot sun. Would probably feel much easier in the shade. My partner had to hang to clean the 0.5 C4.... I recommend a yellow-orange or yellow-blue offset Mastercam in its place.
    Jul 15, 2016

    Fair amount of poor quality rock as well as several ledges detract from the classic status.  Good rests though throughout if you can relax.  The gear on the final traverse is trickier than it looks.  It is easy to stuff a piece up into the crack such that it won't fall out when you let go of it, but placing a piece that would actually hold a fall is a different story.  Take your time to place good gear here.

    So, sometime this summer, after climbing Left Wing a handful of times, I decided to replace the old green single piece of one-inch webbing with a rusty link at the top of climb with two new pieces of red one-inch webbing tied with water knots with 4" tails equipped with two links.... So, I was up there this weekend, and it looks like someone has cut out that anchor without replacing it, (not that it needed it at all).... This makes it really fun to get off this climb, even though fun is what climbing is all about, that is why they make webbing for anchors....

    Man, what a great route! I went out the Elephant Butt to do it a few times over the past couple months, but it was always wet! It was finally dry this morning, and I jumped on it. What a treat in Boulder's backyard. I think move for move this is easier than Wingtip, but the distance you have to climb before finding a good rest makes them similar in grades. Very, very strenuous.    Take a single rack of BD up to #2 and some smaller stuff, and you'll be fine. I placed a green C3 before the second crux layback up high in the crack above your head (not the one you are liebacking) and basically got a toprope.     And what is up with that bolt? There's a perfectly good nut above it and a bomber 0.5 by the fixed Friend two feet above that nut.

Don't want to start a bolting spewfest, but I don't think this bolt was here in the old days, and I didn't see any reason to clip it; the protection in the crack is fine. It's not that I was in some heroic run-it-out mood; that bolt just isn't particularly well placed. A useless retro-bolt on a historic route, or am I missing something?

    Really great climb! I placed mostly nuts and small TCUs (one blue and one yellow). I don't think anything bigger than a #0.5 BD cam is necessary unless you protect by the fixed piece. Also you can find some rests by jamming up and then using that position to place gear. Definitely worth doing.
    Jun 10, 2008

    Pretty sustained pitch.  Off the belay ledge 5.8 face move lead to another stance below the crux which really zapped me of arm strength for the rest of the pitch.  Good gear under the roof lead to a series of underclings to the flake, which is scary feeling.  As mentioned above, the jugs at the top of the flake are a relief, but don't really provide much of a rest stop.  Place a #1 Camalot in the undercling and jet through to the corner.  I fell from this point, as I was totally blown out.  The rest is cake.  Really good route.

    What a great route!  I happened to choose one of the hottest, most humid days of the summer to get on it, which added a little excitement, but still didn't find it to be greasy (as mentioned above).  This is one of the best 5.10+ trad lines in the canyon IMHO. The fixed friend near the first crux no longer has a sling to clip, so plan on placing a red Alien or equivalent next to it.  I think the red Alien / 0.5 Camalot is the only size that I placed more than one of (possibly 2 0.75 Camalots).

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'll give it 3 stars so the average increases a little--easily 2.5 stars in my book.  To follow on Jay's comment, I think a key for this route is not stopping to place gear from those bad stances.  You only need the fixed piece at the first crux, a couple pieces in between before the traverse--then go.    And oh BTW, Quinn really is a sport climber so his rack advice up to only #1 Friend is a little skimpy--you can place several pieces in the 2-2.5 range.
    May 4, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a tough route both physically and mentally.  After I pulled the 10c crux, I wanted a piece real bad before I did more laybacking to the jug...but you are in this really strenuous laybacking position and it is very hard to place pro--it took everything I had to place a "textbook" red Alien at my waist, but the friggin' rock was so greasy that when I gave her a tug she just slipped right out. This ended any thoughts of a clean ascent (although good gear is available)! QS or GB, do y'all just run it out past the crux to the jug to place gear?? Quite a whip if your foot popped! The second crux is short and powerful, there is a big foot out left that saves you, and a no hands rest afterwards.
    Sep 19, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    As Quinn mentions, there is a juggy ledge, and it looks like it should be a pretty good rest.  However, the wall overhangs above this ledge, and it can be hard to get off the arms.
    Aug 15, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    GB is right on in his comment about rests.  Even though you get a juggy ledge before the second crux, the time you spend placing gear and looking at the undercling saps you.  At the ledge, I put my left arm across the hold and as I remember it, I did an inverted (?) right foot knee drop in the vertical crack just below.  Inverted meaning drop your knee as if you were sitting indian style, not the more common knee drop.  Hug into the rock and the rest is great!  Oftentimes sport climbing style makes trad climbing far more difficult than necessary (ie., doing 5.12 face moves next to a 5.8 crack).  It's nice when the two styles reinforce each other.

    This is my favorite route on the Elephant Buttresses and I probably have done it at least 4 times.  Finding reasonable rests is key as the route will pump you out fast.  I always struggle trying to rest before the second crux (undercling left).

    A very worthwhile route.  I found that a #2 Camalot protects the "sporty" undercling well.  There is a good flake where you can place the cam and milk a rest before launching up and left through the undercling section.

    You have actually given the description for a route that Rossiter has called "Variation."

    The route has 3 distinct crux sections.  I found the roof to be enjoyable, but the second crux I had to down-climb and try again!  The third crux has some nice jamming to a layback.  This is a nice route with varied climbing.

    Definitely not 5.9; definitely an awesome route and a delightful lead.  Never did get the secret jug--didn't know it was there.  Unfortunately, the climb is more or less a "one move wonder" --once past the roof, the rest of the climb isn't nearly as challenging.
    Sep 17, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a really fun, short route with lots of possibilities. Knowing the sequence really helps - I'm a very average climber and free solo it with no sweat - no way it's 5.9.    On the opening overhang traverse, one can either hang there forever wearing out your arms, or stem high with your feet, make one small positioning move so you can reach the sharp undercling/horn on your left, match it right hand while your feet aren't doing anything,  then reach high left around the corner for the secret jug.  Once your fingers touch that, it's done.    Above that are three worthwhile possibilities.  1) The route described traverses low on that overhang/wall to the right past that pin, before reaching up for another pull-up bar; easier than it looks.  2) Best option however is straight up, which means surmonting awkward blocks with big holds that don't seem to be at the optimal angle, thus providing a rather enjoyable thrash, as you think, "Dang, I don't seem to be doing this right".  But the holds are big and the cams are at your face.  3) If you go to the left side of this same overhang/wall, there's a sketchy but interesting balance/friction move surmonting a smoothish ramp.    Above this wall there actually are even more options, to either 4th class to top or continue encountering some nice 5th class lips.

    Actually, this route does not necessarily link up with Standard Route.  It links up with Variation, according to Rossiter.  Start the second pitch as you would Variation, but rather than moving right to the face, move left and follow the left leaning dihedral.  These are consistently 5.8.
    Apr 28, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Led this today thinking I was climbing The Standard route.  Discovered this route links up with that one on P2 according to Rossiter.  The roof on P1 goes at 8+ and can be turned any number of ways. Step way left, undercling the horn at the corner, then reach high with the left hand, worked for me. I've seen others avoid the high seem at the corner of the roof and move up the lip of the slab to the left, much harder. P2 crux is a fun corner, albeit short, with good stems, then easy climbing to the top. Fun route!

    Wow, this was a total blast!  I've actually done this route 3-4 times and the crux 6-8 times (via either Std Route or Monster Woman) but all were 25-30 years ago, and while I remembered the general appearance of the overhanging section, I'd completely forgotten the specifics of the moves. Before we went up this, I watched a guy go halfway up and then back off to the right to easier rock. I think his mistake was trying to go up about 3 feet too far to the left, rather than looking for the obvious footholds. It's a little tricky, but the protection is bomb proof and with a little time and awareness, I was able to get up it without much difficulty or strength involved. 5.7+ seems right, maybe 8-. Without giving it away, I'll just say it's all in the foot placement, but I didn't have to stem very wide, (certainly nowhere near as wide as that one photo) which is good since my right hip is pretty arthritic and doesn't take well to that kind of thing. I did The Owl last week and thought that was much harder, both the jam crack on P1 (which I thought was the crux) and the stem on the P2 roof, which was way wider for me. For the record, I'm 5'9"., but back to the Std Rte: great rock, steep and exposed...I also enjoyed the first pitch. 3 stars for sure!

    At 6'4" I thought this route was difficult at the crux. Maybe I am too tall or just suck at stemming. I stayed left of the fixed pin. I would say it's harder than 5.7 but a really fun route though.

    Yesterday morning I on-sight soloed this route. After warming up on East Slab, I hiked down and approached the Elephant Buttress. Balancing my way down the pipe, I found myself at what I assumed to be the beginning. I booted up and entered the relatively dicey movement into and over the small, initial roof. Once up the thin, fun crack and over the second small roof, I was let loose onto the slab that coincided the crux roof. My first attempt of the roof was thwarted by the lack of vision. My confidence waned under the unknown. I returned to the slab to gather motivation and visualize, despite the assumption I would eventually have to back down. I decided to, at the very least, try the exposed, overhang (topped with a ledge) to right of the route. I hoped it would be a simple powerful move to crank over into freedom. Yet after hand traversing over the void, I found no graceful, safe solution. I quickly traversed back onto the route and de-pumped. In the process of retreating, I had this feeling of an unexplainable pull towards and up the crux. I found the stem. I saw the sequence. I told myself not to fall and to stay on, while I cautiously discovered the way. The rest of the climb went smoothly and was great fun. I believe the only reason I stood on the summit is because I truly imagined myself there and nowhere else. One's mind is everything.

    Instead of starting the climb from the left of the small roof, we started from just to the right of the pipe cable and small roof, standing just between the water pipe and the rock. Then traverse left immediately after getting onto the rock.

    Good climb. Crux at start of p2 is great, but rest of climb is a bit dull. Spice it up by climbing off immediately to the left of the V-ramp that starts p1 - 5.7G as opposed to 5.5 or 5.6. Both pitches have excellent pro across the range to 3". The slightly slabby face at the very end looks wicked fun but clearly run out, so I'm scared -- probably 5.9?

    Yeah, my partner led and belayed just above the crux which was helpful because it was tough! Also went to the right of the roof instead...still hard though.

    Great climb -- but I think the difficulty is height dependent.  Not too bad for me (5'10"), but very challenging for my wife (5'2") trying to stem up under the "roof" at the pitch two crux.  Also, the river noise was very loud with the high water -- very tough (okay, impossible) to communicate from belay station on top to climber at the crux on the 2nd pitch.  Nevertheless, a great climb!

    It can be kinda hard to find the start of this route because there are a lot of really fun looking lines along the pipe. Look on the left for a long chain bolted from the rock at eye level and slightly left and then another large bolt directly on the route.    Did this yestarday and it was definitely a lot of fun although I'll admit the crux was somewhat intimidating.

    It sounds as if Matt Chan did what I did today - that is did the first pitch of Standard Route and then linked this up with the second pitch of Monster Woman.

    Fun route. I am 6' even, and found the crux to be full of secure stems that made placing pro easy. It is easy to protect the crux with as much pro as you feel like putting in. Definitely able to do the route in one pitch with one 60 m rope.

    That profound stem on the second pitch, as demonstrated by the photo of Phil Broscovak, is a little rough if you are around 5'6" or so.  There are a few decent face holds off to the left that can help the height-challenged climber shimmy up this section.
    Aug 7, 2006

    I felt the crux of the first pitch was less secure and more dangerous than the roof crux on the second pitch.  Wide stemming on the roof keeps this climb feeling like 5.7.  I'd give it 2.5 stars, but I rounded up.-s

    That pipe at the bottom is really leaky. Got my shoes and rope all wet before I even started. [Definitely] get geared up in the flat area to the left below the descent gully.    Also, I got my rope caught on a [piece] of cable hanging out of the pipe when pulling the rope up at the top of the second pitch.  This led to me free soloing to the top, walking down, unsnagging the rope at the bottom, climbing back to the top, down climbing back to my anchor, and continuing the climb.  Is there a better way to handle this situation or avoid it all together?  I need a giant hook to stack my rope when I pull it up or something.  Maybe a number 6 Camalot would do the trick..      That being said,  I really like taking the cave back to the packs.  Even when it's full of water.  The down climb in the gully seemed a bit scary, almost rappel worthy (or did I miss the rap anchor as well?)

    The crux on the second pitch is definitely easier for taller people.  I lead this route with no difficulty (I'm 6'0"), but my partner on a recent trip (5'3") really struggled, and she leads at a higher grade than I do.  As with any  roof-ish crux, the key is getting your feet high, but to do that, you must stem wide, and I find myself doing pretty acrobatic splits at this crux.

    AC of 6/12/04 - it's just you.  The crux alone is at least two number grades harder than anything on the East Slab.  That said, the Standard Route is very well protected throughout and is mucho fun!

    I don't feel sandbagged at all on this and, in fact, find it only half a grade harder than east slab of Dome across the way and even then only at the crux.

    Done yesterday after work.  Great climb on cool days as the sun keeps you warm.  Wonderful lead as the crux (start of the second pitch) protects well.  It looks much more intimidating than it really is.  Stem and work your feet up until you find enough to grab and go.  Actually, for some odd reason, I tend to struggle mentally more on the start of the first pitch.  Maybe this is harder given a fall would be a bit dangerous.  It just seems a little bulgy and requires trusting the feet with only a small finger hold/crack  with the left hand and slopers for the right hand.    I agree with Ron and I always go through the tunnel even yesterday when the water was six inches above my knees.  Its actually is good therapy after your feet have been in hot climbing shoes.     My favorite 5.7 route in Boulder!
    Apr 10, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Morning shade makes this a good climb for a hot day.  Doing the climb in two pitches facilitates communication if you've got a less-experienced partner.  If the drainage ditch is dry, the quickest descent goes down the backside and angles right to the tunnel between the 3rd and 4th buttresses.  Watch out for poison ivy.  Grope your way through the cool depths of the tunnel (dry with one wet spot on 8/10/02) and walk the pipe back to the start.
    Aug 10, 2002

    I wasn't aware that people do this in two pitches.  The route was pointed out to me from the road and it goes quite naturally in a single pitch with a 50 m rope.  Yes, use long slings in the appropriate places, but as a trad leader you already know that, right?  Breaking it up seems somewhat pointless.
    Jun 17, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Did this route on Feb 16 2001 2 days after a snow storm.  There was still some snow/ice in the bottoms of the cracks at the begginning which made the already scarybeginning trickier, but it was still doable.  I'd recommend parties wait until the sun has definitely cleared it off.  Also, Rossiter's guide recommends a belay at the top of the initial ramp which is pretty mis-matched.  I think a better spot is to belay after the middle "funky" roof section where there is a sloping flaring crack at your feet and a hand crack that shoots directly left.  That breaks the pitches up nicely.  If you used long runners in appropriate places you could link it all into one pitch.  It's definitely fun, though.

    The spelunking return was recommended by a friend, and we too suffered through the dark, cold, wet slot.

    A worthy variation to this variation is to work out onto the slab left of the normal start (with thin pro) and follow the cracks aiming for the left side of the roof, passing two pitons en route.  Traversing back right under the roof is a gas.    For your return to your pack on the aqueduct, a wade through the tunnel between Buttress III and IV, without a headlamp (in the pitch black), barefoot, and up to your waist in water is a character building treat not to be missed.

    I had no trouble on P1 and there are a few fixed pieces which makes things easier.  The roof is challenging but the hands are pretty good and it can be protected well with a nut slid in at the very top of the roof.  It's one of those nut placements in which the size doesn't really matter.    I think the crux was in the "chimney" which is right above the roof.  I call it a chimney because my partner named it such and I also had to use my hip in it.  It's more like an awkward dihedral.  My partner told horror stories about it so we TR'd this part.  It's awkward getting in and you have to use your hip, but then I got two good crimpers on each side of the dihedral and did a pullup with dangling feet until I got high enough to get my feet stemmed.  This seems to be the crux.  I don't know that I would have done this same move on lead.

    Yes, what's up with the "5.9" second pitch? For the second time I followed the roof clean and then backed off the second pitch after flailing. P2 feels like 11a/b to me.

    Both my partner and I (as well as other people I've talked to) didn't feel the 10+ undercling lieback was the crux.  We felt that the section getting though the slot in the roof above was the crux.  Unbelievably, Rossiter's topo calls this part 5.9!  There is a rusty knifeblade protecting this section, then gear becomes marginal and difficult to place for the hardest, most insecure moves.  Even the section after the slot/roof was sustained and difficult ("5.8" in Rossiter), although MAYBE you could attribute that to ropedrag.  Awesome route!
    Aug 26, 2004

    The crux is very protectable and if I had to do all over again at the crux (little roof) I would clip the old piton in the middle of the roof and have a medium size nut and draw ready to slot in the seam of the jug that is on the lip of the roof/bulge and plan to place it quickly and then step high with a right foot onto the arete and with your right arm on the jug lift your left arm to a higher jug just below a old but usable piton and then move your right hand up to another solid hand hold just above your left hand shifting your weight our right onto your right foot (clip the piton and step up for a rest the next section is 5.9 - good luck (efficient gear placement and no hestitation will get the typical 5.10 trad leader through) solid 5.11 climbers will not need to read this - have fun...

    There's a number 2 RP placement instead. As the retro-trad wave continues, look for more missing bolts/hangers....

    This climb has one [redeeming] quality - it's steep. otherwise, there is no real line (you could just as well go up and over the roof at any point) and it was blasted to existence from the aqueduct.  The fact that it got any press is attributable to the popularity of Moon at the time.  There were likely hundreds of FAs at the time that should have been reported in lieu.

    My take on the rating.  If you are 5'10" or taller, 5.12c/d, unless at 5'10" you have negative ape index.  If you are under 5'10", 5.13a.  It's that simple, IMHO.    Great moves, 4 stars out of 5!

    Great route for a summer morning. The trick for me was figuring out the move off the sloping shelf past the 5th bolt.  There are several ways to do this lunge move, but only one worked for me.  A second crux past 6th bolt was powerful but more obvious.  Still more 5.12 above.  This climb has a total of four 5.12 section in a row.  The 5.11d dihedral start can feel pretty burly too.

    Interesting route.  My first attempt it felt really, really hard, but I was paying too much attention to the 2nd bolt above the roof and trying to use it as a clue on which way to go over the roof. Big mistake.  I was trying to figure out what was going on, as Bob/Greg's routes aren't generally stiff for the grade.  I was pretty baffled.  second time, just following the climbing, went much easier.  If it feels really hard, take a step back and try something different - you are likely in left field....    The crack/jug under Bob's foot in the photo is caked in some sort of shit and pretty much unusable (for a hold and for gear as well).  You can get a pretty good 0.75 Camalot out right though.  The climbing above and below the roof was pretty good.  Technical, delicate, and fun.

    I may be a glutton for the obscure, but I think this is my favorite moderate at Happy Hour.    Relative to other climbs at Happy Hour, the climbing in continuous, there are interesting features, and there is an exciting 20ft+ runout on 5.7 terrain to keep things exciting. The roof moves (attacked directly) are cryptic at first, adding to the tasty flavor of this climb.

    This is a fine climb. I climb this every visit. Climbs much better and bigger than it looks, which is good because admittedly it looks like hardly anything.    Tony is right, the line on the photo is incorrect. The upper part takes the nice crack above the roof, just as Tony says. Down low I've always started a tad left of the start marked on the photo, directly up to the left side of the roof. Moving right, onto the lip of the roof is really fun, and the crack above is brief but elegant.    Years ago, while soloing this, I was near the top, pulling up the crack, when a toproper, out of sight, but only a few feet above, threw his rope off; no big deal except for the bloodcurdling scream, which I imagine was intended to sound like "R-O-O-O-P-E," right in my ear. Climbers on Cob Rock must have looked over in surprise. I nearly jumped off in fright.

I went back in 2000 or 2001 I cannot remember and someone had carved a small horn in the rock before the finishing layback moves.  I could now throw a sling around the horn and protect the moves.  It looked like someone brought a grinder up there and ground the horn down.  This should be placed on the modified route list.

    I thought above the second bolt was the crux. There is a bomber jug out right, but I couldn't really reach it, so slapped sloper and pulled hard. A green/yellow offset Alien provides comfort in the pod area.  Committing layback to finish.

    From the anchors you can also TR the right hand side of the arete directly to the left of this.  This is essentially the outter edge of dimentia.  It goes solid 5.11 with a single move to the right escaping the arete before returning to it just after.  Climb from the top of the arete to the bolts.  There would be no protection on lead.    Without this escape move, the route might be 5.11+.
    May 14, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There most certainly is the 2 bolt anchor just up and above the top-out of the climb, below the actual top of the cliff. This route is quite nice, as most of the others at Happy Hour. Reaching the bolt is a bit of a stretch as indicated but the climbing can be eased by backing down and then getting just below and left of the bolt and following this line, I would say perhaps 10a this way 10b straight up and right of the bolt, as there is a funky foot match and small crimps to pull on. 2 stars.

The angles and swing potential for the climber once in the 'business' would be...interesting.

    Fun route...attempted with H. McIntyre on 5/14/06 but backed off the crux because the smallest cam I had was a 0.5 Camalot. I'd recommend red and yellow Aliens or equivalent size for the finger crack. Would have preferred to use stoppers, but I didn't think the geometry of the crack looked all that good for stopper placements. Or, maybe I'm just chicken.

    Was on the sharp end of this stellar route today, and agree with Ron and others, in that those with a long inseam (I'm 5'11") will not have to go to the top of the crack for a stem way left.  This stem is a long/wide one, and is 3/4 the way up the crack, involving a short smear up the face with close to perfect finger/hand jams on great rock.  The sequence above the open book is also excellent...  Thoughtful, sustained moves throughout...  Protects well with medium to large stoppers, small cams up to and including a #2 Camalot.

    I used two #2 Metolius cams at the crux.  You can equilize a few nuts at  the last ledge stance (medium to small I think).  I remember using a #3 Metolius after the crux.  I got the stem move (5'11"), You can reach way out and do a palm smear, then swing your left leg out to stem.  I also found good footholds on the overhanging (right) side of the book.  I onsighted this but fell on Cosmosis, I guess they're both around 10a, Cosmosis is just much more sustained.  This was one of my first 10a trad leads, super cool route.  Kind of like Yosemite but shorter.

    Delightful.  The grade is right on for the crux, which is the open book slightly overhung tasty fingers bit.  It's solid fingers and placements makes it the perfect first 10 lead.  Way to grunt sal!  There is a fixed cam just atop the crux which looks a little worn but still good.  Next time, rock, paper, scissors is mine to win.

    I felt that this route was very true to its grade.  I have lead many bolted 10s and 11s, however this was my first ever 5.10 trad lead.  I enjoyed the route very much.  The slightly overhanging open book is killer, and the finger locks are bomber.  For future climbers who are just pushing into 10s on gear, I recommend keeping your pro organized and ready to plug in, when in the open book.  I chose to keep a yellow Alien in my mouth, so that I would not have to futz with finding gear on my belt.  Overall, the route was killer, I had a great time, and it was even November.

    One of the best routes at Happy Hour.  Interesting, sustained climbing from bottom to top.  The difficulty of the crux is height-dependent: I'm tall enough (6' 1") to be able to do it with a wide stem, but shorter climbers have to do a harder sequence.  For me, the crux is more like 5.9 than 5.10a, but I have seen shorter climbers  who can do other Boulder Canyon 5.9s struggle with the crux.  For sure, Dementia is easier than Cosmosis, so perhaps the 10a rating is a bit inflated.    Easier than Cosmosis, and easier if you're tall.

    This route is not as good as the hype...pretty much a ledge walk all the way up the thing. One hard move at the top of the flared grove and it's over. A good first 10 lead.

    Maybe if I had thinner fingers this would have been 10a. Couldn't jam my digits well past the shallow hand pod. Gear I used: two blue aliens, two green Aliens, red and yellow C3, blue DMM offset nut and BD 2. This sewed it up well.

    I too think this climb is at least 10a in difficulty.  The hard moves are at the bottom and only a body length long.  The pro is good at the crux.  Starting to the left is possible as Leo Paik mentions.

    It seemed as if the path of least resistance is, once you get pro to start, to be just left of the dihedral for a couple moves utilizing some small footholds on that little face to get started.  Then, you can reach around into the dihedral.  Going straight up in the dihedral to start seemed forced.

    I think this route is may be .10b if you have very thin fingers.  I couldn't make the moves through the thin section, couldn't even get a fingertip lock with my fat fingers (and it doesn't help that the rock is absolutely polished with no real footholds to start), so I can't rate this; my friend who climbs solid 5.11 said he felt this was .10d/.11a.
    Sep 19, 2012

    There's a very large boulder at the top and a little to the left for the anchor that looks solid, don't use it.  I originally slung it with a runner.  Then looked a little closer and gave it a little nudge, it moved, pushing it a little harder might have brought it down.
    Jun 20, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is way stiff at 5.9+ in my opinion.  I thought [Dementia] (5.10a) was easier than this climb.  The crux is right off the ground with poor feet and bad hands.  I wanted so bad to get a good finger lock in the crack but just couldn't fit my digits in there.  The pro is very good with small stoppers, blue and green Aliens.  Be careful with your pro placements as I came within a foot or two of decking when I missed a clip.  With that said, it seems like a very balancy climb that is much more about finesse and sequence than power.  A good problem but more in the 5.10 range.

    I'm a super noob as far as trad leading is concerned and have probably lead a dozen routes... and I say Beauty!... very appropriately named. I grinned like a retard when I got to the top. This is one of the most sustained routes (&lt;5.8). I've climbed at Happy Hour about 20 feet below the chains there was the option of going left or right. I attempted going right, placed a cam, clucked like a chicken, retrieved my cam, descended, and went left which I thought was easier... assuming I am not high, any comments on what this variation is rated?    I used 8 pieces total... 2 small Aliens, cam and hexes. Twofers was my first 5.8 lead on trad a couple weeks ago. If I were to compare I'd say this one was longer and more sustained with 2-3 interesting moves. Steve's story was a great way to get started on this route.

    Last time I climbed this was with a semi-beginner. I think I'll leave off his name. He led it, belayed, then took in the rope. So far so good. At this point, as per usual, I wanted to put my climbing shoes on. I stepped back to grab them, but the rope was already tight. And stayed tight.    I yelled, slack! over and over, but the creek was high, he was way out of sight above, and he could not hear. In fact, he just pulled harder. So I ended up in midair, upside down, just off the ground; swinging like a mad spider, pawing the ground like a dog running on a hardwood floor and panting and laughing like a mad drunk, and eventually grabbed one shoe.    I righted myself, put it on hanging with my feet just inches off the ground, then commenced battle again. A crucial couple of inches had since been pulled in, so I could barely reach the ground anymore. Finally, I found a handy stick to prod the shoe closer, and lift it off the ground so I could grab it. Hmmmm. Rereading this, I think perhaps I should leave my name off too.

    TRed this one yesterday and had a dandy time.  As has been mentioned, a 50m rope is just long enough for the climb, which ever side of the tooth you start on.  The anchors are pretty exposed, though and I rigged a bellay to get out there.  Fantastic climb, 3-stars all the way.  I didn't see too manyhand jam opportunities but there was a nice mix techniques from stemming to laybacks.  The crux is about half way up with a thin finger crack/dihedral stem to a fat undercling to another layback.Anyway, gorgeous climb on quality rock!
    Sep 10, 2003

    I agree with the three star rating. This is a fun pitch, and a great lead. The crux (for me) was a high-step from a stance at an undercling about halfway up. The gear is fantastic all the way up.    ...and as much as I hate to disagree with Myke, I've belayed topropers on this climb with a 50m cord, and it works just fine.

    Toproped this route with my 7 year old daughter and my friend Monique who is mostly an indoor climber. We all had a good time. This is a good route to toprope since their are plenty of anchoring locations at the top and the route is almost entirely vertical except for the very bottom. It is also a good climb for enthusiastic but non-hard-core kids; not too much of an approach, a fairly short route and a relatively nice place to hang out at the bottom.

    Protection was good the whole way.  The option for easy stemming through the crux makes this a 5.7.  Pretty short, but worth the quick go.

    The protection gets a little thin (small nuts) a few moves into the dihedral, but I was still able to put about 12 pieces into this route, and they all seemed quite solid. This thing eats medium cams--I used a #0.75, 2-#1, 2-#2, a #3, and a #3.5 Camalots, plus a couple of stoppers (#4, #9, and #13, I think). Don't be worried about the pro.    The stems are fun, but the good part of the route is so short that I'm not really sure it's worth it. Happy Hour has a lot of better climbs.

    All about that finger crack. There were also super straightforward gear placements for an anchor when you gain the ledge, so it would be pretty good for setting up a toprope.

    I just did this as my first 5.7 lead.  I found it relatively straight-forward to sew up the finger-crack on the upper part of the pitch with finger-sized cams (e.g., blue to yellow Aliens).  If you have small-to-medium sized hands, you can get in some great finger locks that will get you through the smeary crux with limited fretting.
    Sep 30, 2006

    Cool crux, it's lots of fun if you only use the finger crack and don't wimp out and go left.  There is a fixed stopper at the crux as of 3/18/06.  I would say only using the finger crack by itself could go at 5.8.
    Mar 21, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If you lead this, make sure to have plenty of small gear for the thin fingers crack up above.  Small nuts and Aliens work well.  Some good finger locks  in the crack, but the feet are mostly smears at the crux (a small bulge) - harder than it looks from below, but 5.7 feels about right.
    May 28, 2005

    This route can also be led with a standard rack, up to a #3.5 Camalot.  The crack that I went up, moving left to right diagonally as you look up was flaring, but it did take two cams.  Leading this is certainly an option before it gets covered in top ropes, although the flaring cracks made the pro less than ideal.    Not just for top roping!

    There are several variations to this line that possibly make it even better. 1) Start as for Rush Hour and move right around the small roof to join the original line: awkward but interesting and well-protected 5.9+/5.10-. 2) After the normal crux bulge, continue straight up a short thin corner instead of angling left (short tricky crux, well-protected with small wires). This takes you almost to the top of Dementia's corner. Now head up and a little left through steep ground to rejoin the usual route just below the top. Combining variations 1 and 2 with the usual crux makes for a very direct and sustained line, and certainly one of the best low 5.10 pitches in the canyon. 3) Dave Goldstein showed me a fun linkup of Last Call to Dementia: Climb through the normal crux of Last Call, step up and place a 4 (or maybe 3.5) cam in a horizontal, then traverse right (fun face climbing) to the bottom of Dementia's crux corner. Continue to the top. Another great low 5.10 pitch.

    I also found this to be noticeably more difficult than Dementia, some of the moves are fairly awkward. No move is harder than 5.9, but very few are any easier. Super sustained at the grade.... So call it 9+.

    There are bolts above this climb, probably for Rush Hour, and they look safer to reach from above than the Dementia anchors which are at about the same level.  I solo down climbed to the anchor, so I know it is possible.  The crux on this is difficult but very short.
    Aug 29, 2014

    If your second wants to climb it, I'd recommend belaying from the top rather than toproping since the rock is a little sharp in places. There are two bolts with rap rings at the top. Also, don't forget to place gear to keep the rope out of the crack.
    Aug 21, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I actually thought this was considerably easier than Dementia.  Hard for a 5.9, as you have to place gear while hanging out on the overhanging section, but the hold there is good, and a medium sized slotted nut is quick to place with the left hand.  One awkward move in the middle brings you to easier climbing.  Walk off is recommended.  I think this is the most sustained and best 5.9 at this crag, and may be the best climb at the cliff, it's a toss-up between this and Twofer's for me.  I like the sand-bag potential for Twofer's better ;-) .
    Mar 23, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If Dementia is 5.10a, then this is .10b.  More physically-intensive then Dementia for sure.  Small stoppers and/or big RPs help protect the thin crack before the 2nd roof.  It is possible to traverse right at the top and lower off the Dementia anchors with a 60m rope.  However, if you do this make sure to use a long sling on any gear placed after the second roof.  Great route!

    Remember those 5.9 overhangs in the gym that you thought didn't exist outside?  There is nothing slight about the overhang IMHO.  A fantastic climb at the grade with plentiful pro; albeit a little tricky to place going around the roof.  This was an awesome climb, I can't wait to do it again!

    Along with Dementia, the best route on Happy Hour.  Sustained, interesting climbing throughout with a burly layback crux past the roof.    Set up a gear anchor to belay, then traverse right and rap from the bolts atop Cheers (aka Thrill of the Chaise) to get down.

    This route is the best on the cliff...really spectacular and 10 times better than Dementia. The crux is definitely getting over the chimney roof, then there is some more hard laybacking up above. This climb is probably a sandbag, but the protection is excellent.

    I thought this route was almost as good as Dementia (which I think is the best pitch in the canyon) and as good as any other route at Happy Hour.

    You can easily set up a TR from the tree at the top of this climb. I would suggest hiking up the left side to set up the TR and hiking back down vs. rapping since the top is rather blocky and would make for a slow and careful rap. Great exposure to rock for beginners.

For pro, bring single and double-length slings, as there are quite a few good spots for them during the climb, as well as at the top for a bomber anchor.    If you're looking for something a bit spicier, you can traverse climber's left about 15 meters and do an easy down-climb to the chains above Thrill of the Chase. Good TR. Use slings to protect the traverse.

    Not sure about the "sustained" comment.  Sure, many of the moves are 5.7, but there are also good rests after every 3-4 (maybe 5) moves (or maybe I'm just lazier/better at finding rests than many) ;^)  There's a short OW about half way up.  There's good gear below this, and a double length sling can be used to sling a chockstone near the end of the OW, but it's a bit strenuous to get in place.  All-in-all a good, well-protected climb, if you're creative.

    This was one of my first 5.7 leads and is quite momorable. Fun variations of moves keep things interesting and the gear is usually quite abundant. I was able to place anything from a blue TCU to a 3.5 Camalot, but since the route is a bit on the long side for Happy Hour, pack an adequate amount of pro. Right before the top you will see two finger-ish cracks: keep to the left one to avoid crossing ropes with anyone on Nightcap. Also, the belay ledge is quite roomy enough for two or three, should you need to share it.

    This route is a lot more fun than it looks from below. Nice variety, good length, takes good pro but requires some thoughtful footwork to get comfortable stances. A great lead for the grade if at the crag. imho, grins has a harder crux.

    This is a solid and sustained 5.7.  The key is it is sustained.  I had a friend who climbs 5.7 but rarely makes 5.8 that went up it quick and easy.  I'll use that as a good [gauge] on the rating. Lots of varied moves make it fun.      It is quite long for a Happy Hour climb.  Previous posting noted setting the anchor in the block above Nightcap.  Instead I went left at that block and set the anchor off the tree (looks dead at first glance but is very much alive) and a few pieces to back it up.  You can see the plaque for Mike from the anchor stance, and comfortably escape off to the top whey you want to pull the anchor later. Rope then comes down directly between Malign and Nightcap.  At the anchor I was a little ways past half rope.  Pulling all my pro on the belay down to let the rope hang straight instead of curving right in the route freed up enough rope to make it back to the ground.  As you then climb to the right near the top, flick the rope over the rock and you're fine.  I also TR'd Nightcap off this anchor and it was fine.    Lots of excellent opportunities for Pro on this route.  A 5.7 lead will tend to put in a lot of pro since it is sustained 5.7, but be careful of the resultant rope drag due to all that pro and the right wandering nature of the route.    DON'T use the chains above "Thrill of the Chase" for this route.  They are way to far left.  You'll be looking at a huge swing and some good non-equalized side loading on the chains.

    An interesting and varied climb.  My wife thought it was tricky and didn't like it, but its puzzling nature is what makes it fun.  A tallented newby climber cruised up this route with not much problem and came down shaking with terror.  "That's _really_ high up there!" she commented.  Amen.    If you rig a TR anchor from the small ledge at the top of Night Cap, you'll be looking at a long swing around some sharp edges.  Dropping an anchor over the ledge about 8' to climber's right of Night Cap is probably optimal.  From the ground, I can see a set of chains that might work, but I'll be damned if I can find them up top!  Knowing Happy Hour, it's probably a mid-5th class scramble just to get there.  Let us all remember the lesson of Mike Sofranko and Happy Hour... :-(

    Regardless of ratings, I think this climb is [trickier] than its 5.8 [neighbor, Grins].  It's got some interesting moves and [isn't] that [wandering], great gear the whole way except maybe right off the ground depending how you start.  [I'd] vote for 1.5 stars, it's worth doing.

    It is possible to plug in a 0.5 Camalot at the crux move. If you set it low enough, there should still be room for a good finger lock above it. At least there was for me. A 0.4 might also work well. Fun climb!

    I also had some trouble with the crux move in the corner. I may have plugged up the key finger lock for the right hand with a #0.5, so I French-freed the move to get my feet high enough to snag a good left hand finger lock and I was out of the corner.    I think I made the move harder than it needed to be, though.

    Fun route, a good one to warm up on before hitting some of the other moderates.  It didn't seem of very sustained nature.  The crux was short, some interesting little bulges on the granite.

    I agree with the 3 stars for sure. The 5.9 section is very short indeed, also you dont need to build an anchor if you just run your rope back a little to a tree up and left and belay from here. You can scramble down and right to get to the anchors for 'grins' and rappell or downclimb. A very enjoyable route with a mix of everything. Enjoy..

    This is a fun route.  It's a little easier than a 5.9, the only 5.9 sections is the small overhang 3/4 the way up.  Even thought this site says that it's a trad route, you could easily top rope it with an anchor between a big rock and a tree.

    I think this route was actually really cool for what it's worth. It's nice to have a moderate or two at this crag. It's hard to rate a 3 move boulder problem. I did find, however, that you can place the #3 (red) BD micronut right after you do the roof mantle. There is a thin crack on the left. I wouldn't think of it as pro, but it does hold a toprope fall for a follower. I also found that the rope runs nicely for the leader if you don't place until the hand jams under the roof, and if you are average height you can clip the bolt from a perfect handjam.
    Jun 13, 2016
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I thought this route was ok.  The start caught me off guard a bit - I didn't even look at it until I started climbing.  Not hard but not exactly easy.  The move over the roof felt way awkward.  Good hand holds but really scrunchy feet. Probably considerably easier if you are short, as the hand movements are pretty small.  Good quick after work 12a, worth doing once.    Also, if you are doing this one with somebody who will have trouble TR'ing the roof cleanly, you will want a plan.  You don't really get gear after the roof until you go way up to the right.  You will need to either back clean and try to get a piece way out left above, or do some other shenanigans.  Otherwise, if the 2nd falls after unclipping the bolt, it would be an unpleasant, rope-grating swing.

    I do agree it was a 12 move, but somehow can't give it a 12 rating seeing as it finishes so easy.  For you taller folk, did you have to use an intermediate after the left hand 3 finger shelf?  If not, I can see how that makes it easier.  At least with my foot smear, I def had to use that intermediate.

    After doing it not knowing anything about it, I guessed 11c or 11d. Call it 11+ and we're good. I doubt it was 12a, but maybe I got lucky or something. Fun moves marred by discontinuity of a line and lots of guano below the roof.
    May 7, 2008

    Definitely .12- crux. One bolt on route (protects crux), is easy to clip from funky layback. Power up off tiny tiny holds to big finish. Rest of route gets R rating. Takes a few TCUs the rest of the way up.

    I would strongly disagree that this route goes at 5.11,  12 minus in my opinion.  It is actually quite enjoyable lead if you angle up and right and join Dementia at the roof.  A one or 2 move wonder with fun climbing above. 1.5 stars in my book.

    I've always enjoyed "Thrill".  I had no idea it was a trad route, but I usually augment the route with a few cams (it's pretty exciting if you only bring quickdraws). This new route seems a bit close to "Thrill", kind of like some of the grid bolting at Sport Park.  I've noticed that most of the bolts at Happy Hour see very little traffic, as most people there choose to do the trad routes instead.  I will most likely enjoy the route, all the same.
    Aug 21, 2004

    A historical note, since I was involved in the FA of Cheers with Rick Leitner and Kent Lugbill. We didn't knowingly retrobolt Thrill - we had no idea that the route had ever been done. We also did not drill the anchor bolts; these were apparently added later by local guides.    A good route worth the two bolts, I think.
    Aug 20, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I would have to agree with the above comments.  This route doubles the bolt count on any other route at the crag.  The lower potion of the route is easily lead on trad gear 3ft to the left.  The 3rd bolt can be clipped from Dementia.  The climbing looks interesting, but it probably should not have been bolted with 8 bolts.

    Chris, Thrill of the Chaise has only two bolts in it and didn't encroach on any other route. I didn't know if it was a trad route and I don't really care.

Maybe this is why you called it Seeing Double....

    Easy to toprope, but the long "runout" up to the first bolt is all really easy (5.6 maybe?), and protectable with gear.

    After pulling the roof, there's definitely enough options for two or more gear placements (if you didn't already use the size, c3s work well). Then it's either a 10-15 ft runout with 5.6 holds or you can take the easier crack to the left, which provides more security.    Expect lots of rope drag caused by the roof if you try a toprope, even with a well extended anchor up top. Even lowering and cleaning was rough on the rope.     There's a perfect horizontal slot at waist level below the roof that gives the best pre-roof placement, either a purple or green c4 if I remember correctly.

    Super fun roof! I had my helmet bumping the roof, and it took me a minute to find the great handholds above. Once I found the hold, it was pretty easy to turn the roof but still really fun.   One of the more fun climbs I've done at Happy hour. Solid 5.8.

    Mostly straightforward. At the roof, both of us did things a little differently.

    What a great challenge for the Gym climber gone outside.  I took a few gym climbers up today and found ourselves (among many others) with a great end of the day climb.

The slab directly above the roof is really thin for slab... just the way we like it.  Jeff Burley

    The name of this route is Brat Slamet (not Slamit). I cleaned, bolted, &amp; led the climb with a hang. F.A.: (5.12 A0) in April 2001. F.F.A.: Henry Lester on March 15, 2003. I belayed Henry, my friend &amp; longtime climbing partner, on this desperate thin, shallow seam. It tweeked my right hand ring finger tendon badly. I was forced to stay on jugs for a couple months to heal it. I returned on January 10 2004 to finally redpoint it. We rated it .12c. It definitely earns its grade.    I have ignored Taylor Roy's slightly inaccurate, incomplete posting of this route for 9 years. The information can be found in my guidebook "Boulder Canyon Sport &amp; Adventure Climber's Guide - Volume II" (2005). There was a time when more climbers got there info from guidebooks &amp; this website didn't have much credibility. Times have changed, so has the great climber that this route was jokingly named after. His editorials used to slam much on the sport climbing in this canyon. I figured if he saw this route, he would say it should be a highball boulder problem, done with a good pad. I don't believe anyone has done it this way. It is a short route with a bit of narrow flat spot at the base. A 30 meter (100 ft.) long rope is more than long enough to descend.

    Like most of the routes at the Hideout, this is my route established in March 2003. The reason the 2nd and 3rd bolts are right of where you climb is for good reasons.  First, placing these bolts left of the tiny arete &amp; corner would mean putting them in a hollow flake. Secondly, putting the bolts to the left would encourage climbers to stem to the dirty corner &amp; ledge to the left rather than stay on the face &amp; lieback up the flake. It is also possible to climb this section on the arete next to the bolts. The way I usually climb the line is to move straight up to a good jug &amp; clip 2nd bolt &amp; then reach left to the flake. Lieback up the flake and then reach back right to clip 3rd bolt.  It is easy to clip &amp; I have never noticed any problem with the draws scraping over the arete. Having these two bolts here also makes for a cleaner fall, as you swing away from the ledge below.  As for calling it PG-13, I struggle to think it deserves a seriousness grade, but if 5.11 is at or above your limit, perhaps it could fuck with your head. It is not dangerous.

It is also possible to traverse right, which is slightly easier (.12b) but not as cool.  Then gain a rest on a shelf on the right side of the arete.  Move left, at 7th bolt, to ascend the left side of arete for an exciting, committing finish.  Clip the last bolt when your hand are above it on the sloping shelf below the anchor.

    Good job Taylor, I worked on this route for quite a while but the crux holds always felt a bit too far apart. The grade seems very solid and probably harder if you're much shorter than 5'5".

    The name was inspired by a friend's childhood memories of playing in the pool with a girl named Chrissy.  Apparently, he was a very naughty shark.    We went up to this route thinking it would be much harder.  Ben quickly unlocked the moves but didn't think he was very close to doing the route.  So, he let me try it, and after breaking a foot and falling on my first attempt, I sent it second go.  Ben did it quickly after me.  A little awkward, and short lived, but really fun.

    Harder than 5.10a.  10b or 10c to onsight it. Apparently both my partner and I missed a key hold and "burly-d" through the crux, finding it later. No less, the climb is difficult. Fun too, but too short to be a destination climb.    Under the roof there are 2 flakes the inner flake seems socketed in pretty well, but the outer one, and one which is tempting to put gear in behind is dicey at best. Beware!

    Probably a little stiff for 11b, but might have seemed easier if I had taped up. I am writing this with holes in my hands from jamming the crystals in the crack over the roof. Fun regardless. Would be 3 stars if it was a 100' pitch, but it isn't.  A single set of cams from 0.5" to 3.5" are the pro, and I used a few med/large nuts for a bomber directional before starting the roof. The second may encounter some issues if they plan to hangdog- I would imagine that they might end up pretty low after a fall, particularly with any slings on the pro below the roof.     As well, like the roof on Vertigo in Eldo, the rope gets sucked into the crack and maybe into the gear. Be mindful and consider taking a hex for a "bearing" placing it sideways out at the edge of the roof to keep the rope out. Set a 2.5" cam above for a directional, then belay up and at climber's right on a big sling around a boulder and a large solid tree.

    The low crux is a single power sequence.  Maybe 10+/11-. Not sure. The start also need not be as for Red Bull, you can do the slab left of that lone bolt for some new territory, and it's not too hard or unsafe.  The arete up top has cool moves- look for camouflaged holds instead of getting sucked too far off to the right.

    A good climb for the short distance it covers. As well, I did it "belly to the bolts," but a different sequence than was done for the FA. I found it to be perhaps 5.11c and more gymnastic/powerful.  Gear: The bolt below the potential gear placement is only at your knees when you reach the next one, so no gear is needed. Why hold on to crux holds for so long when big jugs and a clip are coming?  I placed one to see how it was, but not until I was at the last clip anyway.  Felt like a little bit too much effort since the route is adequately bolted for a safe ascent.

    This felt harder than 5.9, but only for 2 meters. Then again, we did it in sub-freezing temperatures at sunrise. I suspect it might be easier for smaller people, and Mike is a Hobbit, so I can see where he is coming from....  Climb the easy slab with a hand crack in the corner, put in overhead gear (larger) then pull into a lieback and some grunting for a body length.  A #5 Camalot is at the knees for a crux exit, but there is some suspect rock around, so be attentive to place it carefully. I think this would be a very hard and potentially dangerous for a 5.9 leader.  To belay, walk back 5m from the top and sling a few big rocks.  If only the climb were taller than 25', it would get more stars and respect.    Post script edit:  Mike has admitted that the assigned grade was a sandbag and was assigned because this is the 'traditional offwidth sandbag grade.'

    No gear needed.  The placement comes with a bolt at your knees and easy moves after it.  The route is perhaps 50-60 feet, but has a big ledge in the middle  So it feels like a 15 foot slab to a 30 foot climb, with some messing around on a ramp between. In the end, if felt like a very short route.  But it was OK, if you don't mind short routes.  Climbing the seam/flake to the right of the bolts would go on TR or with an added bolt, but be very hard (V6+). I partially brushed this, but didn't do the last move. Maybe more cleaning would fix it.

    Nice climb.  The crux getting to bolt 2 can be a bit of a stretch for the short.  I got my left hand on a crimp, got my feet high, and reached way up for the pocket directly to the left of bolt 2.  From there, it is a balancy move up and right before clipping 3.

    Hard for the grade.
    Oct 28, 2016
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Having done this route both ways (i.e. following the bolt line up and left, going straight up/slightly right) here are a few comments:    The left version felt way hard for 12a, particularly considering that the FA party generally grades things pretty friendly.  I don't know if the heat/humidity had something to do with it, but there are some brutally smooth holds up there.  Clipping the bolt was a bitch.  I would probably call this way 12b or so, definitely as hard or harder than any 12b I have done yet this year.    The right version is easier, but there is some mud and vegetation to contend with.  Also, the bolt ends up being way out left and hard to clip.    Between the poison ivy choked approach, length of the route, etc., this is probably a half star route.  Not the worst route in Boulder Canyon but probably not worth the hike.
    Jul 3, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a nice, short 12 that makes the walk up worthwhile.  Rolofson shows three 12 cruxes (12a, 12b, and 12a), but I don't agree with this assessment.  Clipping the first two bolts is much easier than 12.  From there, reach up and left to the sidepull.  This is the crux section, but is easy 12, not mid-12.  A key hold is a crimper ledge above and right of bolt three; don't mess around with the slopey stuff left of 3.  Another cruxy move follows to get to bolt 4.

    The crux didn't seem dangerous at all.  After bolt 2, reach up and left.  This is the crux, and it is right above the bolt.  The next moves to the bolt are juggy.  There doesn't seem to be any groundfall potential so I wouldn't be worried about leading it if you are pushing the grade.
    Sep 21, 2008

    The Rolofson guidebook calls this PG-13 between the second and third bolt.  After a move just above the bolt, you get good holds to clip the third bolt.  You can even get a red Black Diamond C3 in a crack a couple feet above the bolt if you want it.  Good route that is worth doing so be careful, but don't let the PG-13 rating keep you from doing the route.

    I led this climb twice in 1985.  The first ascent &amp; then months later, repeated it with Cindy Peiropan belaying me. There is actually a lot of protection, but most of it is tiny (#2 micro stoppers or RPs). The start is a very short, small right-facing corner with a #5 or #6 micro stopper, that protects the traverse right to the shallow thin seam ascending the steep slab. Marginal #2 RPs protect moves to the end of the seam.    Here is a deep, thin slot where a #2 and/or #3 micro stopper can be keyholed in. In other words, place the nut the narrow way into the slot, and turn it around to the wide profile. A few feet above, a #4 micro stopper can be placed behind a fragile tiny flake before running it out to the ledge. Double ropes were used: one rope into the keyholed placement, the other rope into the flake. A fall or lower-off will distribute your weight onto both peices of gear more equally this way. The good news is the run-out gets easier the further you climb. Above the great rest ledge, the wall is vertical, but the pro is better (still several #2 RPs and a small tricam). Very exciting but not X rated. I rated it R/X.    One other note is the line draw in Bob D'Antonio's Boulder Canyon Guide is incorrect. This route is not on the west face like the other routes.  It is on the south face and was the only route on that face.    Lastly, I did not place the bolt anchor on top. I believe John Payne added these years later.

    The route is very fun. The core muscles inside of my rib cage were sore for days after I TR'd it; however, I actually don't think that Cor and Wayne can tell the difference between 11- and 11+ sometimes.... I think it's harder!

    There is another route on this wall to the left of orange you lichen it.    The other climb (not sure who did it) goes up face with three bolts,  then goes to trad out some small overhangs.  At the top, there is a one bolt anchor.  You can back it up with a cam, then scramble right to my anchors to descend, or walk off top.    This climb is 5.10ish.

    Bring tape.  You pull pretty hard on a few fist-jams in some pretty coarse rock.  Feels more like Vedauwoo than Boulder Canyon granite.  A fun climb if you don't mind hiking a long way to do 30' routes.    Single set of BD #1-#6 protects it well.  Walk the 6 with you -- it's nice to have for a constriction in the upper section of the crack.

    First ascent:  Mark Rolofson on August 26, 2004.  I repeated the climb months to a year later.  I haven't been back in over a decade, so I won't insist that the grade I gave it of 5.12b/c is correct.  It definitely felt harder than Blue Flame or The Harder They Come.  It is short, but I find it hard to believe this route is only 5.11 &amp; not at least 5.12a/b.

    Different, but certainly no harder than Blue Flame, IMO. I really thought no harder than 11c. Not trying to be a tough guy and downgrade a full number grade, but you reach from a jug to a decent sloper, lock in the bomber heelhook and reach to a decent to poor hold. Then bump to a jug. I warmed up on this route, and I legitimately had more difficulty on The Harder They Come than this thing. Perhaps it's a size thing. I'm tall (but overhangs and roofs are my biggest weakness), and I have fat fingers (so The Harder They Come was tough to get my tips in - but I'm also best at cracks). Regardless, I thought it was as fun as anything else at this wall even with all the sharing of common ground.

    I stick clipped the 1st bolt.  There is an empty &amp; probably partially drilled bolt hole at the start. I have always thought plugging it with a bolt would be wise.

The line really caught my attention years before I bolted it.  It was worth the effort to send it.  I originally rated it 5.12d/13a, but 5.12d is probably more accurate.

    Climbed this on 12/28 after playing around on Huston Crack.  It took some effort to find the rock, and I wish I had read Tony's comment before being there -- the buttress that's directly downhill from the Lost Flatiron threw me off a little.  I probably took a line that was a bit too far to the right of the arete, because it didn't feel like there were any moves even remotely approaching 5.7.
    Jan 1, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Definitely a one pitch route.  I seem to remember that Rossiter's book says it's even three pitches long...now that's an overstatement if I've ever heard one!  Pretty straight forward, no funny traverses that would cause rope drag or anything, so there really is no reason it shouldn't be done as one pitch, seeing as how it isn't even 200 feet.  Oh yeah, the very bottom balance slab getting up on the face is the crux and didn"t feel any harder than five seven with the rest being five five or easier (forgive me my keyboard just fritzed and I can no longer type commas or numbers). Happy climbing!
    Sep 27, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Granted, the approach takes some time, and the descent is steep and messy.  In addition, it seems less than 5.7, and I would say there really isn't a crux.  However, I thought this was a terrific moderate climb with good pro and neat exposure.  Also, the views to Blob and Eagle are excellent; it's a fine place to be on a sunny day.  Although it can be done in one long pitch, two pitches keeps you in sight of your partner for the most part.  I think this climb is well worth doing -- once.
    Aug 13, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If the rock seems crappy, then you are on the little buttress about 50 yards down the hill too far.  Go up and around to get to the right rock.   Take a single 60M rope and do it in a single nice pitch, as the route is less than 200 feet long.  Rossiter's description of a crux at about 200 feet up would have to be correct.  Anyone climbing over 200' on that rock is INCREDIBLE. Seriously, it is nice and it's probably easier than 5.7.  It climbs and protects like a flatiron. Take a single 60M rope and do it in a single nice pitch.

    Couldn't figure out a way to get past the 3rd bolt without going over into the gully with my left foot.

FWIW - the anchor hardware is gone except for the bolts and hangers. It may be possible to utilize the anchors on the route to the right, but that would be difficult.

    Oct 17, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    For the record, my position was and always had been only that the route was 12c or harder based on other Boulder Canyon ratings (excluding S.P.).  I didn't know any more than that. My judgement once I get past 12c/d is just too spotty to have any meaning.  Had AC or Duncan said 12c in the beginning, I would never have said a word. I just felt based on my Boulder Canyon experience, that 12b for EG was outta line with other Boulder Canyon ratings.  The difference between b &amp; c is pretty small, so maybe it wasn't worth quibbling over.  The rock should speak for itself.     I think that a significant thread that hasn't really been pulled out of this mess is exploring the question of "Are Boulder Canyon ratings seriously outta whack with the rest of the world and, if so, what should be done about it?"  My philosophy on ratings has always been that ratings within an area should be consistent, but an alternate philosophy (that I think AC has) is that there is an absolute universal ratings scale that should be everywhere uniformly applied.  That's a fine philosophy, but doesn't address the problem of what to do once a whole area deviates from the universal absolute.  I'm guessing that AC's solution to that problem is to try to "fix" the ratings of certain routes to meet his understanding of this absolute standard, but that creates the new problem of inconsistency within the area.  I don't have any good solution to this problem and thus I fall back to simply grading to be consistent with the published ratings within the area in question, in this case Boulder Canyon.    Regarding quality: we rated EG two start out of three.  That means pretty good, but not classic.  We never said it was classic and that was never our position.  I thought Interrogation was brilliant, that's why we gave it three stars.  Dan did an outstanding job on that one and people should check it out.
    Jun 28, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This has certainly been entertaining and fun, but I think we all can agree it's starting to get old.  Some final closing comments to hopefully bring this chapter to a close:    Quality: EG is definitely not a classic, but a decent route worth doing if in the area.  I agree with Duncan, my other two new routes (Fall of The Wall &amp; Interrogation) on Berlin Wall are better.    Protection:  When bolting the route, I knew the well-protected crux would draw criticism.  Actually, on the redpoint attempt, I didn't clip the last crux bolt until I was well past it.  I agree, it's over bolted here and the top crux bolt should be removed.  I'll do it when I get the chance.    Glue:  I hated to glue the block, but I was afraid that the block might come off and someone would get seriously hurt.  I feel that safety is more important than ethics.    Ratings: I honestly felt that the short EG crux was harder than the crux on Radlands (12d), which is of a similar genre: high-angle face.  EG may well be mid 5.12, as AC firmly states.  I just don't know anymore. Ratings are subjective, and AC is correct, everyone is entitled to an opinion.  The Charlie Fowler quote sums it up best:  ratings don't mean shit.     Comments: It's easy to take things personally when one feels his/her achievements/contributions have been criticized, I apologize if any of my comments have offended anyone.  Be safe, have fun, see you out there...

    I exaggerated.  There are 3 bolts not 4, protecting a body length of crux moves evidenced by your own photo.

    Not that I am about to go get on this route, but I [looked at the] 3rd picture and though to myself- Hmmm... a X'd flake hanging there- looks like a death block.  So if one were to spend the time rap bolting this thing, and putting epoxy into it to hold on the key holds, wouldn't it have been proper to clear the deck below and get rid of the death block?  This is something I wondered [about] for Free Willie at Animal world too, though there I am sure the concern was that it'd bomb the road after smashing down through the Boulderado.  What is the normal and accepted ethic in the sport arena that sort of concern not-withstanding?    Is extensive gluing really that widely accepted? It bumbed me to see it on Empire Of the Fenceless- since the climb would go without that glue-reinforeced hold just the same.    Again, I acknowedge that I have not been on this route, so my questions are rhetorical, but since both FA-ists are obviously reading, please share your thoughts...

    AC onsighted... it was moderatley impressive :)  I got it second try, despite my enormous reach, it was still hard(12b).  I agree with ac too, that local routes like evictor, hairstyles, your mother are all way harder than this one.  Even more local, Grand Inquisitor(12a), frogman pinnacle(12b/c), the arete at animal world.... So big deal, it's overrated.  Now let's talk route quality... crux moves are cool!  That's about all of 6 feet with 4 bolts to clip.  The rest of the route is nothing to write home about, not to mention the gallons of glue it took to hold the sucker together.  With so much wonderful climbing in boulder, this route doesn't even show up as a blip on the classic radar screen.  No offense Bob.

    Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. My opinion is 12b, you guys can rate E.G. anything you want. What's the big deal? Sometimes a subtle variation in beta (especial on a slab) can make a hugh difference. My sequence was 12b! E.G. felt easier than Camouflage, Genesis, The Evictor, Power Bulge, Animal Instinct, Hairstyles, Pretty Hate Machine, Big Sky Corner and Mystery Arete. That is why I think it is 12b. If you want to do a 13a check out Bed Hog, Buddha Belly or The Rainbow Wall.
    Jun 27, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    East Germany (EG), being a new climb, has only seen a few ascents, thus a consensus rating hasn't emerged.  Based on my experience, I think the face crux, albeit short, and very well-protected is a technical 12d/13a.  Both Jim Redo and Vaino Kodas (credible Boulder climbers) feel E.G. merits a 12d rating.  12b seems way off, AC, but in the realm of things, what's important is that it's a fun route on beautiful granite.
    Jun 26, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Hey AC (Pat Adams or Duncan Burke),  you're welcome to your opinion, yet we beg to differ.    12b is outside the range we think is possible for East Germany.     Take ''Plan B'', as consensus a 12b as there is in Boulder Canyon. Saying EG is the same grade as Plam B is not credible, the very first time I got on Plan B, I did every move on it (but didn't redpoint it that time). Compare this to EG which took something like 10-15 tries before I did every move on it (and I think I'm climbing better now than when I got on Plan B the first time several years ago).    While EG may well not be 13a (since I don't have the exeperience at that grade level to be sure), neither is it 12b.  If you (AC) are Duncan, then please note that your height would pretty much let you reach past the hard parts of the crux whereas those of us of shorter stature don't have that advantage.  If you (AC) are Pat Adams, then you climb at a much harder level than the rest of us and maybe are not as good a judge of easy to mid 12 grades in the canyon, which is the range where most of my accents are.  So I think I know 12b.  EG is not 12b in my opinion.    A more productive discussion would be possible if you identify yourself and your background and credentials would then be clear to all of us.  Having someone like Duncan come up behind me in Mountain Sports and say ''12b'' is not exactly the way to start a conversation about such a topic as the consensus grade of this route.

    There is a fixed rope to aid in getting up the gully if coming from Boulder Falls, it looked solid, so we used it to rappel back down the gully. Great route! Sustained.

    We were originally gonna name this route "The Fall of the Berlin Wall", but that was approaching paragraph length so we shortened it to just "Fall of the Wall"    Given the current Boulder Falls trail closure, note that it is possible to approach the Berlin Wall from the Dream Canyon parking lot and rap in.  If you do so, please respect the private property near the parking lot and stay well away from the cabin that's located there.  Also, at the top of the Berlin Wall be aware that there is lots of loose rocks and knocking any of it off could nail someone below you.    Hope you enjoy this route and it neighbor, East Germany 13a. :-)

    Great route, give Dan credit for finding this hidden gem!
    Sep 9, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Hint: You can rap into the anchors for this route from above and hang draws on it. This also shortens the approach a lot. Park at the Dream Canyon parking lot and head left and down the hill, avoiding the private property. There is a faint trail that you will find between the edge of the woods and the clearing, follow that thru a wooded gully formed by a spring (wet) and then follow the trail up a short hill. Keep following the trail past an old fire ring on your right, then look for a cairn on your right slightly down the hill from the fire ring (which was at the high point). From the cairn, head down the hill to the top of the Berlin Wall. You will find a modern two bolt rap anchor in the rock on your left. Beware the loose rock in this spot and the exposure, its a long ways down if you screw up. From the rap anchors, rap to the top of either Interrogation or East Germany. Either route is easily equipped by rapping from the anchors on the routes. In other words, once you rap down to the route anchors, clip in, pull your rope and rap again. 60m works for sure, don't know about a 50m.    Its much easily to approach and climb this way than going up the yucky gully from Boulder Creek to the base of the Berlin Wall.    Hope this helps

I am hoping the bolts on Bobby's Wall have not been chopped.  I'll go check it out at some point.  Have had a lot of good feed back from people who have really enjoyed these routes over the years. Such a nice, isolated spot.

    A one-pitch sport route that feels like an alpine adventure route.  This is a good time of year to climb this because it starts right out of the creek and the water level is very low now. There is a 5 ft waterfall a few feet away adding to the atmosphere. Still lots of lichen on the upper slab.

    Great climb and a pumpy warm-up for the Berlin Wall, but I am disturbed and disappointed by the bolts that are not 3/8" wedge bolts, like the bolts on "Vishnu", but 5/16" bolts with a 1/2" nut.  My guess is that these are not wedge bolts, but externally threaded 3/8" diameter sleeve bolts.  If you are going to use this type of bolt, I think is best to use the 1/2" diameter ones (a 1/2" sleeve and a 3/8" diameter bolt). If they are wedge bolts, then that's really lame and dangerously weak.  If I am going to drill 3/8" diameter holes, I use a 3/8" Hilti or Fixe stainless steel wedge bolt.  I usually prefer to place Powers (1/2" diameter X 2-3/4") 5 piece sleeve bolts.  They stay tight unlike bolts with a nut on the end and are very strong.  I stopped using the 3/8" diameter 5 piece bolts in 1995.  The 5/16" bolt used in these sleeve anchors is fairly easy to break from overtightening.  Once placed, they seem to work fine, but they are not as strong as the 1/2" diameter sleeve anchor with a 3/8" diameter bolt.  It is very, very rare to hear about one of these 1/2" diameter sleeve bolts breaking from being tightened with a 8" or 9" wrench.

    We went up to do Vishnu and noticed this new route.  This route is a junior version of routes on the Red Wall at Devil's Head.  Excellent incut holds on a slightly overhanging wall.  Great position.  The top still has lichen and the holds are a little grainy, but it doesn't distract from this fine route.  Excellent find guys.  The knife-edge arete to the left looks wild (Pranja?), but there are some scary-looking flakes on it.  Anybody done it?    This route and Vishnu are located on an exposed pedestal in one of the most scenic spots in the Boulder Canyon/Dream Canyon area.  N Boulder Creek makes a big bend here so you can see up and down Dream Canyon as well as up Boulder Canyon towards the Narrows.

We only left my draws on the route since there was a rockfall incident resulting with a rock hitting me in the head and injuring me (fortunately not too seriously - blood running down my neck and stuff from the wound, but a CAT scan at BCH showed no internal damage). Wearing helmets while belaying is probably not a bad idea. We recovered the draws this morning, thinking at first that someone had swiped them since they were no longer on the route. Fortunately, I could not quite believe that someone had swiped my gear, so I looked in the nooks in the rocks at the base of the route for my gear and lo and behold it was there. :-)    Was it one of the Jim's who cleaned and stashed the gear for me?

    The original rating of this climb was .12c. I have redpointed it twice, first in 2003 &amp; then returned in 2014 to redpoint it again. Neither time did it feel easy. It is harder than Lucky Strikes, which I repeated on the same day in 2014 that I repeated Art Of Dreaming. Art Of Dreaming is very technical with a difficult, committing clip to the 3rd bolt. I suggest hanging a medium &amp; a long Petzl draw on the 4th bolt to clip early before the crux moves. A fall onto the 3rd bolt can land you very close to a ledge below the route.

    I wasn't that impressed with this route, given the hype I had heard about it.  Lacks an independent start, crumbly/flaky rock for the feet during the crux, the bolts through the crux are located to make the clips as awkward as possible, greasy unpleasant climbing, lowering and retrieving the draws is a pain, etc.  Definitely glad to not have to do this one again.    Hard to grade as the crux is just greasy. Probably 12a during cool dry conditions but really gropy when warm and humid.  The roof probably isn't even 11a (not sure how it gets described as 12a, the holds are huge and the feet are good). Mostly easy filler climbing above, which is ironically probably the best part.

    Surprisingly good.  The route climbs much better than it looks.  The crux is height /reach related, which may explain the differing opinions on the grade.  For my size 5'8" &amp; 0 A.I. it's 12b to the rest, followed by a fun 11a/b roof and a romp to the anchors.

    12a, you're joking A.C.  The traverse after the third bolt and getting to the good holds under the roof is highly technical and merits a solid 12 b/c rating.  The roof is 12a, and above is very easy.  Anyway, I agree it's a great climb, especially now that it's cleaner due to the some climbing traffic.

    Interesting climbing for the first four bolts. Getting past the second bolt is a bit snappy. Moving right might be reachy for some people. A gem at 12a. Keep up the good work.

    Gear is really not needed for the belay. Simply clip the first bolt with a long piece of webbing for your belayer. On a breezy day, there is no wind in the gully, which makes for a very pleasant belay with an alpine feel to it.
    Apr 3, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A fun route.  If you brought gear it is best to belay on the ledge behind the gully.  If you did not bring gear this is not an option as a fall would pull the belayer off and into the gully.

    I agree with Roger on this one.  The gully is a pain, but it is a nice route.  I found the crux to be getting to the third bolt.  Maybe I missed something (or I'm short), but I ended up clipping off a crimp.    This is a route where it is better to bring your second up.  The view is great!  It was much nicer to belay from the large ledge, rather than lowering and belaying in the gully

    Personally I think this route barely tips the scale at 5.12. A hard entrance move leads to easier climbing and then probably mid-11 climbing on Bobsled. More like 5.12a as the entrance moves are barely V4, but, nonetheless, this climb is good with a weird finish on Bobsled.

    Rolofson lists this start as War Sled, and escaping the line even higher as Freedom Sled.      His description of the full War on Freedom mentions stemming out to the holds on Bobsled, but I've been trying to stay the line.      Edit: I finally unlocked the stopper move and know the line will go without any use of Bobsled holds.  It's an intense high step/rock up move off the slopey crimp to the high sidepull seam.  Now I just gotta put it all together on lead!

    The righthand sidepull that Stephen (above) speaks of is definitely loose and about to go. Though thankfully there exists a sidepull slightly lower and to the left of said loose sidepull. Certainly makes the crux (which I thought was between bolts 1 and 2) a bit more reach and difficult but still doable. I normally wouldn't rate sport climbs of this nature PG13, or R for that matter, but this one warrants the PG-13 rating. First of all, the moves between bolts 1 and 2 are now considerably more difficult and above a) a large protruding boulder that could potentially injure the wary or fledgling 5.11+ leader, and b) you might receive a pinewood enema from a abnormally sharp branch located on the tree directly behind you when pulling crux moves. Other than that, this route is pretty good and can be combined with "Art of Dreaming's" roof pull for an interesting and more physical alternative than the OG Bobsled finish up the dihedral... let's call it "The Art of Bobsledding."

    Interesting route. the crux is, well, setting up for the crux. Luckily you can easily get back down to the ledge to try another setup.  I thought the bolt could have been placed a bit higher. It was a little spooky with the potential of swinging into the ledge/corner. The upper part is a lot of fun with nice rock.

    I thought the crux was pulling up around the small roof, near the forth bolt.  The moves by the first bolt are a little tough to figure out, but not that hard to execute.  A little awkward getting to the anchors.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Nice route, overall. It has a few 5.11 cruxes with entertainment between. The first bit was fairly clean, but if I were to go back to it, I'd probably spend a little time cleaning it with my fingers, particularly the crystalline granite band by the feet by the first 3 bolts.I found that the sequence was a little something to figure out, but not much to execute. Transitioning into the undercling was tough until I backed down and found the right hands to start from.  As well, moving to the second bolt was no prob with the right sequence, which requires either height or flexibility. I got a nearly-hands-free sequence between the two bolts with a great toe-hook/toe lock up and left in a "crotch" of the dihedral.    Good fun and interesting moves.  Mind puzzle not physical problem.    Depends on the sequence and upon your height. It's tricky and so I suspect a lot of people will not find the easiest way on-sight.  I did see one very good climber trying to figure it out before resorting to aid this AM.

    Jul 3, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I would concur that Bobsled is a bit soft for 12a, however, there is a reach problem passing the first clip that would be very hard if one lacked the ape index or were simply too short. This reflects the primary reason that it is difficult to assign an intrinsically optimal grade to a climb; the subjectivity of the rating can depend so much on exactly how one's own body "fits" the climb. I'm reminded of watching various of the hard core working The Seven PM Show in Rifle where a particularly wide pinch-grip would fit the big bear claws but a small pair of mits could never pop a thumb over the edge of the pinch. So for those with smaller hands the problem was essentially not doable. In the same vein, the reach from the start on Bobsled could be 5.12 for some and 5.11 for others. Overall, Bobsled seemed to offer interesting climbing with very brief cruxes followed by good, no hands, rest stances on solid rock that was well bolted.

    I think the best option for a warm-up on this wall is to link Smell the Coffe with Cafeine Buzz. It's a super 160ish foot pitch. As far as getting off, I think lowering the second to the ground from the top would make the process pretty simple.

    Best done as one long pitch, continuing from Smell The Coffee or The Daily Grind, thus avoiding a hanging belay.  Good face climbing past the third and fourth bolts; the loose-looking flakes on the left are easily avoided.    The rappel to Napster leaves you at a small stance at the anchor; cramped for two people.The second person down  can wait on the ledge just above the Napster anchor until the first person has rapped to the ground.

    Not knowing what this was we did this as 1 pitch as a continuation of Daily Grind. Nice enough. Didn't seem particularly loose. A good pitch for a weak second to lead if he/she can't lead the easy 10s at Plotinus (which are very easy as 10s go). To see how soft many of the ratings are at this crag, do this climb and then do Cozyhang, a classic 7 trad on The Dome (which was rated 5.5 way back!). After Cozyhang you might conclude that Caffeine Buzz is 5.5.

    The crux section difficulty is definitely based on the climber's height.   At 6'6" I would give the crux 10-.  The hardest part for me as the tricky top out move to get to the anchors.    The first time I led it with no gear.  Not very wise.  The second time I used a 0.5 and a 0.75 on the runout and felt much safer.

    This and Snooze were the best pitches I've done at Plotinus. So at 5'7" I made a dynamic move at the point I think all you tall people are saying this climb would be hard if you are short. Bullocks! That reachy move is only hard if you are short and refuse to let go. Easy catch but I welcome exciting moves with a 1 foot fall potential. Yeah, very brave.    As far as the rating I'll say 5.9 unless you are saying this is harder than Cosmosis 9+? It is hard for me to consider different ratings standards for different areas of Boulder Canyon. Maybe 10c in Sport Park. Okay, so maybe Cosmosis is just hard for me...but this climb was not. So you short people need not fear the spray of these tall guys with their huge positive ape indexes and go climb this route. Climb the Snooze to the left as well.

    I racked up for this route with a slew of small-to-medium gear after reading these posts and it ended up being nothing but dead-weight.     The "run-out" sections were always accompanied by easier climbing (and a nice new bolt) and I felt that to stop and fiddle with a placement would have been a waste of strength.     That said, the event of a spontaneous fall (aren't they always spontaneous?) probably would have resulted in a rather unenjoyable ride down the feature-ridden face.     The moral of the story: Bring gear if you like to feel safe, but whatever you do, get out and do this route. Dream Canyon is a very special place and is held very dear by those who visit.    Many thanks to Bob D. and Vaino for their route-setting and effective bolt-placement.     A final note: I chose to rap myself  to avoid rope-drag on the edge of the headwall. I came all the way to my stopper-knots on a 60m rope.

    This route is definitely harder than 5.10b for shorter climbers.  Maybe it is 10b if you're over 6' but for me (5'7") the crux was desperate.  The route to the left was a lot easier in my opinion.

    At the lower crux, there is a little sidepull crimper you can use for left hand. It's my secret hold. It's about 6 ft left of the 4th bolt.  I'm 5'11", and I can't reach that top hold. But using this crimper, you can work the feet up without barn-dooring and voila - reach the top holds, and you're done!

    I agree on not needing gear.  we hadn't read this site, of course.  Being in sport-weenie-mode, it didn't occur to us either to bring gear, or to desire it while doing the route. I didn't notice the run-outs.     However, like so many things, if I had had some gear with, I probably would have used it.
    Dec 8, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Roger &amp; Dave, as Ray indicated above, the need for gear was reduced by the addition of one bolt a few months after the route was put in. There was a section of about 40 feet (below the top 3 bolts) where gear was needed. This was also the area where the block was removed that nearly took out Jim. Although I don't think it was that close but did make a good story. I drilled the bolt. The rock in that area seemed a little crusty. The only reason you would fall is if the rock broke, and it seemed that the flakes over that small steep section could snap off.     To add another perspective on the "lookout Jim" episode, I was lowering Bob as he was to remove the flake. We moved everyone from the area (Jim was not yet in the area). Next thing Bob was holding this large flake screaming to be lowered. I got him to about 40 feet from the ground when he released the object. That was about the time Jim was ascending the fall line of the approach gully. He started hopping pretty quickly for an "old" man!

    Climbed this Sunday 10/20. Great route! There's is a large block (1/3 'frig) just to the right of the last bolt that is quite loose. There is an X on it now, but it could have monumental consequences if somebody pulled it off.
    Oct 20, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Bob - a simple solution. We have lowered trundelers that were far too large to carry by drilling a bolt in them and then lowering the rock via a block and tackle pully system attached to a higher bolt. Most of the ropes will handle the job, but a static line has saved beating up the lead cords. Even a two-pass pully will handle some big loads (several hundred pounds), and smaller blocks can even be lowered with a GriGri. Beats getting stoned to death.

    If you can protect a climb to prevent an injurious fall, you owe it not only to yourself, but your partner, who will be forced to deal with you and your injury.  I agree with Peter that falls sometimes happen well within your ability (remember Derek Hersey?).
    Oct 16, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The relationship between difficulty and protection is not as straightforward as that. On this route, there is at least one15-20 foot stretch with no bolts. If, for whatever reason, you fall, it's going to have serious consequences. Merely saying that gear is not required because you lead a given grade and had no problem can mislead others who may not savor 40 foot fall potential regardless of difficulty. On this route, there are sections that are very closely bolted and others that are not. If you have no problem soloing 5.7, which is basically what you're doing on the runout part, then don't bring gear (and don't screw up). Otherwise be prudent and take a light rack. If you find you didn't need it, great.

    One of the better 10s on the wall. A single crux of maybe 2 moves can be done a number of ways, but most will feel harder than the given grade. One way, at the given grade, makes it all finesse, but does require 5'9" height or greater if I am guessing right (I'm 5'10" but have LOOOOONG arms and had 5" to spare).    ~5.10b. The shorter, the harder...

    Excellent route.  .10b/c seems about right.  I'm 6'1" and could juuuust reach the key hold at the crux.  Shorter climbers will definitely have to do a hard intermediate move to get there.

    The bolt count is actually ten -  a single bolt was added (not by the FA party) on the very day that provided that little bit of excitement for Jim.

    Nice 5.10 climbing spoiled by an awkward 5.11 clipping crux.  One of those weird big-stand-up-on-one-leg with no hands moves.  Then you basically are balancing on one foot, swaying in the breeze, and swinging a draw at the bolt.

    For a nice warm up (if 5.10 is hard you that is): climb the first 4 bolts of The Daily Grind, then at the small overhang before the route gets thin along that little seam - traverse left up and over the overhang and finish on Smell the Coffee.  This I thought was a decent 5.9 climb as you avoid the crux moves of both routes.  Even with normal draws I didn't feel much rope drag as the two bolt lines are pretty close.

    Definitely 10+ if you go straight up at the mini roof. At 6.4 I can just about reach anything, but pulling that highstep with the seam layback was pretty thin for mid 10.     We thought this and Smell the Coffee were a bit forced (also climbed Snooze Button and thought the same thing). There are definitely some cool features on each route, but linking these features within a suggested rating and trying to climb the route the way the first-ascensionists envisioned felt pretty contrived.     I have a beef with routes where a much easier variation can be had by climbing within a wingspan or so of the intended line. Why put in a 10+ sport climb in 10- territory? Such is the nature of sport climbing, I suppose.    Oops, didn't mean to rant. This was my first sport climbing visit to Boulder Canyon, and ended up feeling a bit cheated.

    A few points, since I guess I [stirred the] pot...    1) If the bats are what I think they are, there nowhere near endangered. Perhaps the first thing to do is for someone (I guess I can, if nobody else is better qualified) is to establish what they are so we can react with respect to what pressure the species is under. 2) The bats probably are NEW there.  There was not the typical stream of crap and piss out of the crack, although it was quite pungent.  The colony was large and LOUD. If they'd been present on the FA they'd have been noticed. Let's conclude that the moved in later. 3) There are no bolts directly on this section.  Also, you don't need to stick your hands into it to climb it. It's gripping a flake.  They got most upset when I stuck my head over there to look in on them to try to determine the species. 4) Aren't Bats seasonal?  I can't imagine they'd [rather hibernate] in the crack living in [icy] runoff in the winter rather than in a mineshaft 400 yards away in the winter. They may move off and not return. I asked that question before so as to establish this possibility. 5) Maybe nobody should climb the route until late fall/winter and then see what the situation is. Since the primary source of info about this cliff seems to be this site, we can self-impose a closure of the route here.  If we're worried about people just showing up and getting on it, we can clip a laminated notice to the second bolt (where land managers won't be, but climbers will see) regarding the request not to climb the route due to BATS.  Thus we close this route and don't get an over-reaching and over reacting closure on the whole thing. [After all]- the closure of the cave was for a general area the bats were in. This crack is not so general, and the bats didn't even notice and had no reason to notice what was happening on nearby lines. A total cliff closure would just be stupid. 6) I brought this up in good faith that nobody would overreact. If people do, I will have learned my lesson in front of a huge community- that will all learn not to try to 'help' and just keep concerns quiet in the future. This would be an unfortunate and counterproductive result if the county freaked out this time.    Any bat experts out there?

I am sure that the bats would find a new home and survive (ok skip the BAT RAID), and we can continue to pull down!

    What is holding the pillar up top in place...Well, to some degree the dirt back behind it, to some degree inertia, and to some degree, just plain slip Vs tip statics. Gear low on it shouldn't pull it off- gear up top might pull out, but I wouldn't think so. If it did, I don't think it would tumble the tower. Maybe I am taking about a different tower?    In any case, if it did fall, the absolute SWARM of bats back behind it would be really pissed off.  On my way up there, I first smelled them, then they started tintering at me. I looked in to see about 50 of them crawling all over each other and further into or out of the crack.  I moved on pretty quickly to avoid much more disturbance. They were probably Brown Moytis, but I'm not a bat expert, so maybe there is a look-alike of which I am unaware...    The route is not bad, but not that great. It still needs to clean up a little, and the bats take a little away from it. When (if ever) do they move out and go [someplace] warmer/drier?    The climb in general is more honest at its grade than some at the cliff.  10d seems fair [enough].

    If anyone could explain exactly what is holding the big pillar in place, and what is likely to happen if any of the gear placed on the left side of it actually had to hold a fall, that would be interesting. Fortunately since that section is easy it's not likely we'll get an answer to the second part of the question. But don't pull too hard up there all the same.

    My Vote: Bob did us a favor, neo old school: pitch a few more rocks, call the finale 5.11-, it's a winner...
    Nov 8, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Just for the record: I did the first ascent of this route  sometime in 2000 with Dave Goldstein, entirely on  natural gear. We thought it was 5.10+ or easy 5.11, and  we would have given it an S rating for the loose rock  near the bottoms and the sketchy traverse into the  corner, past what is now the third bolt. I didn't name it.    I climbed right of Bob's line after the third bolt, staying in  the obvious corners. In my opinion, this is more fun and  logical climbing than the way it is bolted, and since you  need to carry gear for this route anyway, give it a try and  see what you think. At the top, I traversed left just below  the second-to-last bolt, which is a tad easier than the  bolted finish.    Just to be clear: I am NOT advocating that the bolts be  removed.  The bolts (and cleaning) have improved the  first 30 feet of this climb, which was difficult and  somewhat dangerous. Though the upper bolts don't  really add any safety to the line I climbed, I'm not  worked up over them either. The climb is a bit more fun  now.

    Fun, steep route with very good holds. Clipping the 2nd bolt is the crux. The first bolt is uselessly low. It will not keep you off the ledge. The route is strangely bolted, in typical Bob D'Antonio style, with too many bolts in places the don't necessarily protect difficult moves above ledges. 3 stars for movement, but the bolting somewhat detracts from the climbing. This was pretty easy, albeit pumpy, to onsight with plenty of good rests and jugs. There is certainly not a single 5.12 move on the route, including the heinous 2nd clip. It is a V3 boulder problem into 5.11 climbing. Of course, you can always choose a more difficult sequence. The way I climbed the route, onsight, ground-up, 5.11+ could be overly generous. Compare this to any mid to hard 11 at Castle Rock, Eldo, or the Flatirons for a reality check. Worthwhile and top 3 on the wall after The Scientist and Lucid Dreaming.

    Since Fall 2002, I have climbed this route many times. I have always stick clipped the 2nd bolt. I would recommend this to most people trying this route.  Blowing this clip would be a ledge fall &amp; really impact the belayer. The crux is the overhanging start with powerful crimpy moves. Once you at the 3rd bolt, the climbing is sustained 5.11 with a second redpoint crux after the 4th bolt (.11d/12a). Gain the shelf &amp; no hands rest at 8th bolt &amp; it's over. There is an exciting runout 5.10 finish. Great route offering a powerful start followed by a good forearm pump.

    I thought this route was pretty damn good from bottom to top... save for the last contrived 15 feet where it's easier to go right at the ledge into an easy corner system and then step back left using jugs to clip the last bolt and up climb to the anchor. I also thought the lower section was pretty difficult, but honestly clipping the 2nd bolt was not hard. The moves \after the 2nd bolt are hard! I think lock-off strength and precision footwork are a quality skill set to possess when climbing this route. Pretty spot on for the grade I thought.

    I clipped the second bolt and downclimbed to the ground, then went back up, stuck (struck?) the next move and finished the route. I thought I had flashed the route until another climber complimented me on my "nice try." Is downclimbing considered poor style these days?

    Good job, Young Doug. Pay no attention to the spineless downgrading. The route is 12b even when compared to Rifle routes at the same grade &amp; even with the kneebar rest which is probably more taxing than making the 4 more moves to the slab.

    Sometimes it's hard to determine whether a hold is "on" or not. Try this simple rule, which works well in Boulder Canyon: When you are touching the hold, can you touch a bolt with your elbow or your knee? If so, the hold is "on" and you can proceed to use it with a clear conscience.

    Hey D. Rivers that is a great way to put it!  I agree.  Your friend is right on.  I have never been  a strong onsight climber but I've always been able to "whittle" a route down until I can do it.  I'm sure most of us have had the same experience:  we work a route and when it finally goes think "man that felt like 5.11 (5.10 whatever)"  I think I've read a lot of people downgrading routes after they have them so wired the can do laps on them.  Its always been my opinion that the grade of a route is a subjective measure of a route's difficulty, onsight, on lead.  Your friend says "whittle it down to 5.10.  I've always said "beat it into submission"  same idea.  But beating it down doesn't change the grade does it??

    A good friend of mine, who regular on-sights to soild 5.12 and redpoints to 5.13, has a phrase for hard redpoints.  In his mind it's all about "whittling the route down to 5.10."  Redpoints are always substantially different from onsights, whether it goes after one or one hundred tries.

    (beta question following...don't look if you're an on-sight type)    Is the large crescent crimp up and right of the first bolt "on"?  Going there, then back left to the second bolt, was really not that bad. All the holds are pretty incut.  Of course, you don't think it's good, just looking at it, but I saw someone use it, so I tried it, and like-alot.    Oh, and the top is a little strange. The easy corner is so inviting! It's hard to avoid.     I say 11d, because it certainly wasn't harder than "James Brown's Wild Ride", which for some reason always sticks out as a benchmark 11d.

    Full disclosure: I fell off at the crux on my first try, then hung at the top (easier, but pumped). Lucky Strikes is a really cool route. Good moves, tricky in spots, several cruxes, although none as hard as the bottom. Hard to on-sight because of the strenuous nature at the bottom and the caution used going up and checking the holds and figuring out the moves. Once you know the moves, they feel better/easier. I got thrashed trying to move with caution through the bottom.    Really nice line. Too bad it is not super-straight.  Close to a 3* line though.    There are 12b's I can't even dog my way up... but then again, this route is really hard to get on-sight. It felt easier after finding the holds, but the difficulty is in reading the route, not just doing the moves, so give or take a little, the grade is probably about right.

    To go back to an earlier question you asked, I believe "getting" a route of this nature, as opposed to an aid route or an ice route for example, means no weighting of equipment on the way up. If that is the definition, then the route could be gotten in any manner of styles of ascent. Climbers have names for most of those styles, many of which I listed previously with the possible exception of "top rope". I think that, with respect to the grade of a climb, that should be an objective number, unaffected by the style of the ascent. Without doubt, most if not all climbs feel easier with rehearsal. However, the holds remain the same whether the route is onsighted or not. I believe that this is why the style of the ascent is just as important as the grade number attached to it. A true onsight of Lucky Strikes would be a much more impressive achievement than mine, even though both ascentionists could claim they had gotten this route at 12a (or whatever the grade is). What's your opinion?    I agree that the purpose of doing a free climb is not weighting the equipment and that any number of styles can be used to realize the achievement. The question is whether a number really reflects the achievement or indeed really holds any value at all except as a rough guide to the potential physical and mental demands of the route.    Your phrase "the holds remain the same" reflects the truth most of the time but how often have people said "a hold broke so it's harder" when no hold broke at all. The thing is that people change day to day, even hour to hour and their ability changes with it. That, combined with the sheer complexity of routes, means there is no such thing as an objective 12b grade. It's like saying a cloud looks like a dog. When I look at it, it may be a parrot. Is it the same cloud? What can we agree upon about it?    The same point applies to style. Yes, a graceful, naked solo onsight would be very impressive, more so than a typical hangfest culminating in a sketchy, draws in place, shakefest. But style ultimately remains a personal choice and as long as you're not altering the rock or affecting others with your choices, go for it. Paradoxically, this can result in conunundrums such as whether soloing routes (theoretically good style) with other parties on them is maybe not such good style. In the end however climbers who seek to standardize, codify, or regularize the experience are chasing an illusion. Yes, doing a "12b" onsight is more impressive to someone who is impressed by that sort of thing but I am impressed more by people who think and ask questions about the assumptions we all make about even such a trivial pursuit as climbing. So, thanks for making me think about this some more.

    I've done this route at least half a dozen times, mostly with no-preclipping. By now it feels like mid 5.11, except for clipping the second bolt which is still pretty tenuous. Given the amount of space devoted to grading comments, I shouldn't add any more but I would like to say this. If you find a route easy you may be a better climber than you thought. I'm ready to downgrade everything in Boulder Canyon and Clear Creek along with everyone else but it seems kind of pointless. Some routes feel easier, some feel harder, all of them are challenging in different ways. Getting all wrapped up in a number masks that truth.

    I would say that all the aforementioned advantages would certainly make the route easier  than 12b if that's what you're asking. If it qualifies as "getting" the route, that is a question of a deeper, more philosophical nature. What does getting a route mean to you?

    Just Wondering:  Does a prior-knowledge, no-falls, first go, draws pre-hung, rope clipped through the second draw, ascent count as "getting" this route?

    Two comments: First, Lucky Strikes gets my vote as the best line on the wall. It has interesting moves that utilize some very nice turns, ascends largely excellent rock, and has good continuity with a developing pump. Second, we found the nut on the first clip to be completely loose (2/16/03), in fact I took it off by hand. Knowing how much Bob and Vaino have done, I reckon that this is not a case of poor craftmanship. Here is how this nut loosened up. The crux climbing on Lucky Strikes comes between bolts one and two and as a result bolt one receives a lot of hangs and therefore a lot of torque. Since a wedge bolt has the nut on the outside, unlike a Rawl, rotational torque on the hanger will tend to unwind the nut if the rotation is clockwise. In this case one is moving right for a jug and any pull on the hanger will be clockwise, as a result unwanted torque on the hanger will unwind the nut. Its hard to beat if clips one and two receive all of the dogging. Stick clipping bolt two can help, and may be advised for the near future. Cementing the nut can help, as can a lock-washer. My personal preference is to use a Rawl, where, although some loosening may still arise, it won't dissemble the whole unit. This not a Tom Ridge panic button just a cautionary note for a sweet line. By the way, it may be a good recommendation to drop in some Rawl bolts on the new line going in to the left of Lucky Strikes, although the crux on this route will be higher on the wall - just something to think about.

    My favorite 5.12 on the Plotinus Wall.  The crux is definitely clipping the second bolt after the powerful start.  I was able to find a decent rest in the upper alcove below the ledge, and down low between the second and third bolt.  I thought the route was generally pretty clean compared to the other routes on the wall.  Thumbs Up overall!

    So, am I the only one who thought an all points off dyno to the little shelf out left on the arete was the way to go?  After 2 tries of trying to get there statically the dyno worked really well and was super fun!  Afterwards on TR, I just reached out several feet above the shelf and used the arete with the thin crack as a sidepull for my right hand (instead of the dyno).   I placed 3 mid sized cams for pro, which seemed just fine.  Agreed the top section is consistent and can pump you out quickly.  And yes 60m rope mandatory...even with one you just barely hit the ground so be careful raping or lowering.

    I'd call the "low" crux traverse left from the corner to the ledge .11b. But, since it's only one or two moves, .11a makes sense too.    For me, the most enjoyable climbing was on the final headwall. It's never harder than .10c(?), but consistently thought-provoking.    The 30+' corner between the 3rd and 4th bolts is well protected with two or three pieces chosen from 6 - 9 Stoppers to .75 - 1 1/2 Friends (or similarly sized Aliens, Camalots, etc.)     This and The Daily Grind are probably the two nicest climbs uphill from Sleepless in Boulder.

From my point of view, skipping crux holds doesn't make a route harder, it makes the ascent of it harder. Maybe I am missing what you are saying, or maybe somehow this explains the differences in the grades I've been feeling between sport or trad lately.  That maybe sport grades are made on the onsight by people used to redpointing?

    Good route that starts a little grungy and maybe loose, depending upon the path taken. The route soon improves. The other day I saw "medium gear" scribbled on a topo, so I took 1.5-3" gear.

If the bottom 30' were more like the rest, it would be a better line, but it is very worth doing.    I just have a really hard time saying that this is harder than Left Wing, let alone Pegasus, Kangaroof, or FM... I can't grade it 11c.

    This is a nice long pitch with a variety of climbing. Between bolts 3 and 4 in the corner, I placed a few cams ranging from about a #.4 to a #1 Camalot. (I think that a #.5 and a #.75 would be particularly useful.) I also placed a finger-sized stopper in the easy-but-runout section between bolts 1 and 2.     A 60-meter rope is useful, as ours just reached back to the base of the climb while lowering, although this depends on where your belayer stands on the steeply sloping ground below the route.

    The easiest climb at Plotinus and one of the best.  It's not difficult, but the moves are esthetic and fun the whole way up.  An awkward move past the second bolt seemed about 5.8.  The traverse left at the last bolt looks intimidating, but seemed about 5.9 once I got into it. It could be more difficult for shorter climbers to make the reach left to good handholds, however.    A comment on quality ratings:  Some people seem to find easy climbing boring and uninteresting, and give easy (or unsustained) climbs few quality stars.  In my opinion, a climb with a single crux, with lots of fun easier moves, should not be downgraded in quality just because it isn't sustained at the crux level.

    Another good climb seriously overrated.  I appreciate above posts that reference rating against several other long established lines in the region.  To continue that, this is easier than Hair City and West Buttress, any 5.9 on Castle Rock,... and that list could easily continue.  I can't think of a lot of 5.8s that are harder around here, so in that vein I'd have to say 5.8 seems more like it.  I know this is touchy ground, but keeping the rating inflation under control seems like a good idea.  - Cindy

    Even funner than it looks from the ground, but nowhere near as hard as Over the Hill. Easier than Bolting for Glory, too. I vote 5.9, if a majority grade makes sense.    5.9 **

    I first did this route shortly after it had been put up, and thought Bob's grade was right on. It has cleaned up nicely, and I found holds today that I had completely missed in the grit and lichen before. It is easier now, yes, but certainly not 5.9. Sandman is harder than a typical bolted BC 10a, and for that matter, Over the Hill. I'd call it  10a/b, and do be careful getting to the first bolt.    A two star route at a three star crag.

    Pretty good line and if nothing else, nice &amp; long. There are a lot of good 10's at the cliff so that a 5.10 climber can make this a day's destination and do good routes all day- in which case, this should be one of them.    Pretty good route, but not the best in the area. So far, Sleepless In Boulder or Lucky Strikes seemed the best at the cliff.    The route seems easy at its grade, but a 5.9 leader might be a little tweaked on it, eh?

    Another vote for the quality of this route here. This is indeed an excellent route on quality rock, with moves that are surprisingly aesthetic and continuous. This is one of the finer bolted routes I've ever done, bar none. Thanks to Bob and Vaino for this line.    These days I'm more inclined to see route ratings as unique to the area as much as being strictly conforming to the YDS. I.e. "an Eldo 5.9" or "a Vedauwoo 5.9" seems to mean more, if that information is available.    That said, I think this route is "a Boulder Canyon 9+".

    I had been up to Plotinus Wall twice before, but skipped this route because of the one-star rating.  What a mistake.  It was reading Richard's comments that changed my  mind and he is right on.  This route is destined to become one of the most popular moderate sport routes in the Canyon given the high quality of the moves and rock combined with the tranquil setting away from the highway.  Regarding the rating, I thought this route had no moves harder than Animation 5.9 (aka Jaycene's Dance 5.8) at Animal World, but anyone who skips this route because of the rating is missing out.

    I would like to add my vote of at least another star for this climb. Grade possibly 10a although given the downgrading mentality for this area, let's call it 5.8 to be on the safe side. Whatever the difficulty, certainly one of the most enjoyable moderate sport climbs in the canyon and the best warmup on the wall.

    Two stars for sure, at a minimum. In two trips to Plotinus Wall, I found myself running up this pleasing pitch each time. The line has fine , thoughtful movement on largely excellent rock that is well protected. And it gets good sun. This leads me to musing about good climbing. Sometime in the middle 80s Alan Watts crystallized the one thought that has driven much of climbing for two decades or more. He said that "difficulty is the objective" - and (arguably) that statement set the whole quest in motion. Frankly, it may be equally important to recognize that "esthetics is the objective". In most circles, esthetics and difficulty equate nearly perfectly, but esthetics also allows that some moderate climbing contains some of the most pleasing movement you can find on rock. Mr. Sandman offered up pleasing, esthetic movement in a nice environment without amping up the difficulty quotient. What more could you ask for?

    A fun route, which is still a little dirty due to lack of traffic.  It shares the  pumpy layback start of Bedtime Story before branching off after the fourth bolt.  A fun stem left at the sixth bolt, a neat bulge with good handholds up higher, and a crux slab at the top.  The hardest move was at the next-to-last bolt; 10b/c seems about right.  I may have skipped another hard move at the last bolt by sliding to the left.      After leading the pitch, I lowered from the anchors and my partner followed and cleaned the pitch on top-rope.  It would be hard to clean the pitch while lowering or rappelling due to the traverse from the fourth to sixth bolts.    If you scramble up the loose gully to do Bedtime Story, be sure to do My Buddy as well.

    This is a nifty little problem with a flake system that just begs to be climbed. There is an interesting transition from the angular movement in the flakes to a fingery crux passing the small overlap.

    This reminded me of climbing in the ADKs; the runouts keep it from being actually blah, especially the last one up the headwall!  You can easily belay from the Morpheus anchor.

    This line starts off with some interesting opposing force moves to attain the good holds at the 3rd bolt and then immediately sends you in to a powerful lieback crux. It's really pumpy from the ground up through the 4th bolt and warrants an 11c rating in my opinion. I think the given rating of 11a no longer applies, since the big flake directly under the crux was removed. Grab some big jugs at the top of the sequence, and de-pump while on a nice cruise up through rock features similar to its neighbor Mr. Sandman. Come to a big, chalked-up flake, and prepare for the second crux to gain the arete and then up to the anchors. A long route with lots of intriguing moves, great rock features, and two distinct cruxes makes for an excellent sport route!

    Burly start but luckily you are fresh for this part.  Mostly easy climbing.  I didn't really like the bolt placement up at the 'step across' move.  The move isn't that difficult but a little awkward.  The bolt should have been placed higher, so that you could clip from the high point of the good hand holds.  There is a ledge about 10 feet below, and your belayer can't hear or see you at this spot.

    Nice variety, fun route.  From the perspective of a TR watching someone suss out the moves, I'd agree with Bob, this felt 5.11a/b.  Around 7th bolt, there is a foothold R to make the move easier.  Seemed the crux was around the 9th bolt moving R to the lieback.
    Jan 15, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I finally got this yesterday and I give it 5.11c.  I never climbed it before the flake was removed and I think it has probably become significantly harder.  Instead of standing on top of the now-defunct flake, you have to lie back and get your left foot high on a flaring crack that is above where the flake used to be.  This entire bottom section is fairly burly and leaves you tired when you finally pull it.    I think another tough section is at about the 7th bolt as seen in the photo.  At this point there is an edge on which to layback, but it's difficult to get into.  The layback is left-facing, and you start to the left of it, so there is an awkward swing into the layback position.  Once you clip and mantel onto the holds over the clip, there are few holds on the face and I had to reach right for the arete.  I think this is on-route.  You also have to reach right for the arete before achieving the anchors, unless I'm a wuss and there is some way to stay on the face without using the arete.

    I did this route on Saturday and it felt a bit harder than 11a to me and it appears that the missing block may have assisted in the feet situation between the second and third bolts.

It is an excellent route, but a huge flake has broken off between the first and second bolt changing the difficulty of the climb the ease of clipping the second bolt.

    Variety is the spice of life. Overhanging laybacks, moderate face, and some interesting moves to reach the arete.  Didn't see any loose rock on the route -- but reaching the bolt that protects the hard move right to the arete is a stretch.
    Mar 22, 2004

    Hard and strenuous at the bottom. Easy in the middle. Perplexing moves right and up at the top. I moved right onto the "arete" for the last moves to the anchors. Is that what people do? There was a bit of chalk going straight up the thin crack using small sloping footholds. But you'd have to reach right anyway to clip the anchors.    I didn't notice anything loose, but I see the big yellow question mark on the big flake in the photo. I, and presumably everyone else, hung on this flake with full body weight.    I rate climbs by Eldo and Boulder Canyon trad standards, so I'm calling this 11a. Could be 10d by those standards. I typically struggle (ie, hang once or twice) on 10c trad, but onsighted this.

    Climbed this a couple of weeks ago.  Good jugs on steep rock down low.  Upper headwall moves are pretty cool.  Agree with the comment about the huge flake between bolts 1 and 2, although it *sounds* completely solid.  Didn't notice the loose flake up high though so maybe its gone now.  Check for loose nuts on the bolts -- two bolts (one at the anchor and one a couple of bolts from the top) had extremely loose nuts.
    Jul 8, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    On May 31, my partner and I counted 11 bolts to a 2-bolt anchor. And there is indeed a slightly loose flake near the top of the route.  At first glance, it is an inviting hold, which you reach right for, just below a clip (at the 10th bolt, I believe). When I grabbed it, it groaned in a sickening way. Also, at the beginning of the route, be wary of a large slabby block (about 3 feet by 4 feet by 8 inches) between bolts 1 and 2. The top of the block is a very sharp juggy rail that you use for your hands and later your feet. This block seemed solid, but there doesn't seem to be much keeping it attached to the wall; it is undercut below, and there are cracks on all the other sides, including underneath.

    If you go straight up instead of heading off to the right, this route is definitely more difficult than Mr Sandman. Fun, balance-y, reach-y and technical enough to make it interesting. Check it out and watch your feet at the first crux!    Also, if you want to make things real interesting, try a full four-limbed layback on the roof fin. Felt like I was in yoga class... forty feet off the ground.

    After having done this via the left seam and straight up past the bolts (more like just right of the bolts but not wayyyyy right) they seem kind of equal.  Balancy on the left seam and a high-step/throw to a crimp on the right of the bolts.  Felt 5.10 both ways.  There is enough rock in Boulder that I didn't need to go literally straight up the bolt line, but yes this would be harder.  Definitely not the path of least resistance.  Funny though coming from Washington, DC where all the local crags are tiny - there would be three variations to this climb.  When you only have a few climbs to choose from you explore every option.

    For a nice warm up (if 5.10 is hard you that is): climb the first 4 bolts of The Daily Grind, then at the small overhang before the route gets thin along that little seam - traverse left up and over the overhang and finish on Smell the Coffee. This I thought was a decent 5.9 climb as you avoid the crux moves of both routes.   Even with normal draws I didn't feel much rope drag as the two bolt lines are pretty close.  You can call it Grind the Coffee or something...The crux was a balance, "do you trust your feet" thing.  It's all there you just have to find the little footholds.  Felt 10 on the left seam.

    We climbed this by going slightly left at the second bolt, liebacking the seam.  Felt pretty hard for 10a... definitely harder than Napster or Mr. Sandman.  It's tempting to even call it 10+.
    Oct 6, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    OK... If this a 5.10a then Napster is definitely not a 10c. The beta photo has the 5th bolt wrong; you do not go around the small roof, you go right over it.     I would put this route at 10b/c going straight up the bolts (crux between bolts 2 and 3) as Bob intended; even with the good side-pull it is a balancy move that is hard to reach if you are shorter than me.  If you go right, you are more on the start to The Daily Grind which is well-rated at 10b/c, and another fun route on this part of the wall.
    Aug 17, 2003

    When this route was being developed, it was envisioned to climb it slightly left of the 2nd bolt. That was the crux, I thought some kind of 5.11. The real good handhold that you clip the 2nd bolt from did not exist in its current form.  There was a loose flake on top of it, so you had to be careful how you pulled on it. When that flake came off, it made a very good hold that allows passage up and right. The farther right you go, the easier that move becomes, probably 5.9. It makes for a good route at a consistent grade.
    Jul 11, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Pretty good route. Going WAY right at the crux seems like the line of least resistance, as my partner did it, and we were both a little confused about the intended line. It seemed a little easy that way, but that's where all the chalk was.     Going slightly right (left hand stays in clipping range) seemed about right for the grade, and if you stayed direct, 'belly to the bolts' it seemed very hard. I wound up to do it that way, checked my head and asked "5.10a?" and then moved a little right. It will go belly-on, but it'll be mid 5.11.    Depends how you do it, can be a little easier or much harder.

Before I climbed it again yesterday I noticed that the 5th bolt is out left towards the arete and made me wonder whether I did it as intended before. I went left around the arete, and it felt 10c or maybe harder for me, but I'm not the best with smeary feet.

    I agree with the above comment that the rightward traverse across the roof (after making the second clip) is a little nerve-wracking.

    Great bouldery climb. Exciting moves that make you shift your hips like you're dancing on the rock. Even though the top 1/3 is uninspiring, the first 2/3 is great and worth repeating.

    Another fine moderate line, Wake Up Call, delivers an interesting crux after gaining a good ledge system. The move passing the second bolt can seem reachy but some inobvious foot work should make the sequence doable even for the height challenged. Very nice addition.

    Pretty fun route with a hard move down low and a sustained finish, being tall really helps. I think if you avoid the dihedral it's about 13c (pretty contrived) but otherwise sits in the 13b range.

    It's short with an interesting boulder problem start. I found some graceful beta off of a tenuous left sidepull. Foot placement and body-tension are important. I thought it was a better warmup for Lucid Dreaming than Mr. Sandman, for instance. Also more convenient. It was pretty dirty, so I gave it a decent brushing. The bolts are placed well, and the crux is engaging enough that it deserves two stars, imo.

    I'm with Adam 100% on this, i.e. please don't add perma-draws, and Jacob, arguing that draws are not permanent because you can take them off with a wrench is a semantic distinction. IMHO Boulder Canyon routes are a very bad venue for permanent hardware...especially on a wall where there are already quasi-access issues. Plus, there just isn't a need, because it is super easy to clean the routes here.

    That's a tough one, Joe. My initial thought about the route was that the top half was wasted mileage, although I came to see it as a fun cool-down after the business. Cleaning the pitch is pretty simple, and I don't think moving the anchors over will make cleaning the overhanging section much easier.     The route is a well established classic, which has been done too many times now to change it, IMO.
    Dec 13, 2016
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Anchor location on this route has always been a bit baffling which is shared w/ The Scientist and Rama. Probably the case of the FA making due w/ an anchor on a previously established route to make things "easy." However, in my opinion the anchor should be right around bolt six which would make cleaning on lower super easy. The terrain above bolt five is at best 5.9, and nobody who sends the crux and clips bolt five is ever falling off anywhere higher. In addition, the terrain after the crux is ho-hum.    I don't think this climb is a candidate for permanent draws. However, do bring a stick clip for bolt one as it's too risky otherwise.

    Jan 3, 2015

    Not going to mince words in saying that I oppose permadraws on a route like LD. Hanging draws on this rig is a breeze. I've done it several times. Moreover, having permadraws prohibits the ability of hanging draws for a traditional onsight, which still matters to some climbers. Convenience draws are best suited for gyms and steep, dry, cave-routes which are otherwise a major undertaking to equip. I own expensive Petzl Spirits for a reason, and I don't want to be forced into using permadraws because someone else wants them there for training-route convenience.
    Jan 3, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Equipping the route with Climb Tech type draws will not be permanent. All you need is a wrench to undo the quicklink. This route has had standard aluminum draws hanging on it for the past few seasons which have deteriorated fairly rapidly. I'm all for hanging a few steel Climb Tech draws on this route, they will be safer, and in my opinion look better than a bunch of mismatched B-team draws with potentially dangerous, sharp grooves worn in them.

    Hi Curt,    Please do not permanently equip this route (or any other, for that matter). Perma-draws are an eyesore and totally unnecessary for this route. Lucid is easy to clean, and this is a beautiful canyon that should not be blemished by needless permanent draws. Thank you for considering the natural beauty of the area over the minute of effort it takes to clean the route.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    KCP, the draws taken down in May were mine. No big deal. I use to do the route a lot and just had them up for ease of climbing and not having to clean. I have actually donated several sets of draws over the years. I have thought about permanently equipping this route with some steel Climb Tech draws to the first 4 bolts which should last a long time, mainly to prevent having to climb the 5.10 to the top and not having to clean the route. Most pull through the crux, and once standing pull some slack and take the whip. Maybe someday I will get around to it. Good to always inspect and pull garbage draws from routes though, so thank you. There are plenty bad ones out there....

    I hung a set of draws today on Lucid. They have a grey dogbone and black Omega biners.  Also there are two blue BD QDs for the anchors.  I fell and injured my foot while attempting the route and couldn't rescue the draws.  I will be back in a few weeks to retrieve them when I'm better.  If anyone cleans them before hand, please contact me. Thanks.

    There are currently no fixed draws on this route, and I did not find hanging the draws to be such a chore that this route should be equipped with permanent draws. Easy to hang the draws from good stances and good holds. I can see this pushing 13a for short folks and somewhere around hard 12 for tall folks. Either way, good movement, great holds, and although the climbing eases considerably after the crux, the climbing above the crux is still cerebral.

    I'm with J on this, Chris. The draws were sun-damaged, and the biners were worn enough to potentially damage rope running over them. The draw on the fourth bolt was curled up stiff into a 90 degree position from the sun-damage. If you can't see the danger potential from the pic, then I'm especially glad that I removed them before someone gets hurt.    As for replacing them, it's not my responsibility, nor am I in the financial position to. LD is not a gym route, and no one asked the draw owner to equip the route and leave his or her draws there indefinitely. It was obviously done out of convenience, with little regard long-term wear.     I took them down and posted that here so that the owner would know where to find them and the community would know not to hike up there expecting the route to be equipped. I even offered to deliver them within Boulder city limits. I felt (feel) that it was the responsible thing to do. Hopefully you can see it that way.     Peace

    ^^^^^  Why again is it Ken's responsibility to replace the fixed draws? Want a solution to your perceived problem? Bring your own gear, and clean it on the way back down. Personally I think it was awfully generous of Ken to take the time to take pics of the gear with an offer to return it.

    I removed the draws from Lucid Dreaming today. They're no longer safe. The one with the square-cut gouge in it was on the third bolt that people whip onto when they blow the lip.

    As reference, ac's bouldering scale is off by about a number grade (V8=13a), but you will find many more climbers capable of climbing a V8 boulder problem than a 13a.  I believe George's 12b grade may be a little stiff (that is most likley the result of being a solid 13 climber).
    Oct 18, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    To further the case for downrating you can dyno past the first crux from a jug to the shaky flake (height-dependent but easy V0+ move for most people).  To my belayer's dismay, this seemed like the most efficient idea, and after seeing him thrutch on the layback to get to the same hold, I figured he was doing it wrong anyway - he should spend more time bouldering and learning dynamic movement because this is nothing short of a giveaway to anyone who boulders.
    Jul 12, 2005

    I felt the route was 12c,  and I'm short.  The [Flying Beast] at Easter [Rock] is much harder and that gets the slash grade of easy 13a. Although the routes are a bit different in angle [The Flying Beast] is two boulder problems separated by a not so good of a rest as Lucid.

    Rating--depends on height.  Easier for taller people.Upper crux feels about like Hagan's Wall difficulty (V5), lower section feels about like Consideration difficulty (V4) -- so it is essentially a V4 with a good shake followed up by a V5.  Which adds up to something in the range of 12d.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Awesome route.  Hard to believe this line wasn't put up until recently.  I found the hardest single move to be the long move from the jug at the 2nd bolt... this was a low percentage move for me.  If you don't have a stick clip, you can clip the first bolt of Rama to remove the possibility of tumbling down to the creek.    Not sure what to make of the downgrading going on here.  I think people just like to give Bob a hard time.  I've been able to finish 12c's at Boulder Canyon and Shelf really quickly of late, but this one will need a bit more work for me to link.

    I'm bummed that I'm moving from Boulder, because I won't have routes like this in my backyard anymore.  Not too bummed to get away from all the mindless downgrading ego games, though.  Yuck.

And it is bolted just right for some good clean air when you blow the crux before clipping the 4th bolt.  Great job, Bob!

    Nice climb, nice moves: too bad I didn't link some of them...Speaking of the holds maybe breaking off, The hold on the arete from which to clip the first bolt is cracked back behind it and scares me a little. Check it out and consider stick-clipping bolt #1.

    My personal answer is that it is not a question so much for the community, but for Hare and Peisker, who did the route 22 years ago.  But if you are collecting opinions, I think the route is fine. I question why you think retrobolting it is necessary?  It is top-ropable already.

    TR'd this line after leading the Scientist.  that bolt is pretty darn high off the ground, and nary any good pro to be had before it.

    I stayed in the corner and stemmed all the way up.  Seemed like one dicey move to get to the last bolt but it wasn't too bad.  Above, I used one #1 Camalot and a gray Micro Camalot in the finger crack (.5?)  My partner thought it was going to be a clip up and didn't bring any gear.  She tied knots in slings and sent.

    I stayed in the corner including the crack at the roof, but still consider it only 10c.  Going out left at any point seems off route in a sport climbing sense anyway.    I used a green (smallest) Splitter 2cam for the last section to the anchors.  Get some if you still can!
    Dec 8, 2003

    Totally esthetic climbing, use good footwork straight up the corner past the bolts, then finger jam up the crack - awesome! Went well for me... hard 10? A handfull of small TCU's to Camalot Juniors, or stoppers if you prefer, are ample to protect the rest of this great climb.
    Oct 18, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The top needs narrow cams or RPs. Micro-Camalots are too wide to fit in the low profile crack up there. I consider myself crafty with gear, and I had all 4 micros... but I had to run it out. I had a ton of nuts in the crack/flake below though. A ledge-fall maybe, but not a grounder. I guess one has the option of stepping left and clipping bolts on The Scientist to finish there.    Good line, but a little flakey still. Needs some more cleaning down low.      I could have gone straight up the corner, but since I was already stemming to the left (might my right shoulder on the right wall), it seems natural that what's in for feet is in for hands, so if someone reaches out there, they'd seem on route to me. The climb felt like 10b.
    Jul 23, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Peter, your first comment above leads one to believe that if you don't have RPs, your only other option is to run it out.  Not the case at all.  Maybe you don't own Aliens but most of the Front Range climbers I know do own at least a set.  Small TCUs, micro-Camalots and small stoppers would probably work fine as well.
    Jul 15, 2003

    As someone lacking a quiver of Aliens, I stand by my comment. The climbing may be easy but without trick (and expensive) gear it may feel exposed.
    Jul 15, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Stay in the corner if you want... Move left between the 2nd and 3rd bolt.  I've done it both ways now and it doesn't matter how you do this pitch, it's a fine route.  Probably my favorite on the crag so far (out of about 9).  I'll agree it's a little contrived, and it's a committing clip for the 3rd bolt if you stay in the corner, but, fun either way.    For the gear, no RP's needed.  You can plug in the smallest thru the red alien in reverse order (starting with the red); all pretty bomber placements.    One last note about this route:  I find it pretty funky to get to the first bolt.  If you blow the move and come off before the clip, you and your belayer could end up in the creek (far below) if said belayer isn't anchored in.  Might be the same for any route along this sloping ledge but this is the only route I've climbed on this side of the wall.  Be careful.
    Jul 13, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The ground to the left is just too close to be avoided on this route. I don't think you should rate the route by calling this stuff (two feet to the left and never out of arm's reach from the bolts) off limits. That's just too contrived to make sense. So, it's not 5.11. 10a might be a bit low, but a lot closer.    Also, the gear section above the bolts is probably 5.8. I placed two yellow Aliens and a green Alien. I could have placed probably eight Aliens if I had wanted. This isn't dicey or thin. No need for RPs or even stoppers if you don't want them.     Ray's idea to head right looks fun. A bit more rope drag that way, but probably no problem.     This was a fun route, but too short. Cool moves in the dihedral and up the steep section.
    Jul 11, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is certainly one of those routes which tempts with nearby easier ground, but you are still funneled into a steep section past the last bolt where most aspirants will certainly want to place some gear.     The dicey upper section can easily be avoided by doing the soon-to-be-popular "Rama Dreaming" linkup. Power over the aforementioned section, place a good stopper, then shoot out right to the obvious bolt on Lucid Dreaming - it is maybe 5.9 to the chains, and all bolts.
    Apr 11, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I think if you follow the bolts directly up the corner, it's 5.11 but if you climb the obvious easy terrain to the left it's about 10a. This would be a really good moderate pitch except for some fairly thin pro up high. Bring RPs or run it out.

    One of the best slab climbs around Boulder. A real gem. On par with Bearcat goes to Hollywood and longer than with similar quality as Prince of Darkness. The bolting, unsurprisingly considering the FA, is a bit strange. The first bolt is quite low, and blowing the second clip, although easy, will land you on a ledge. The bolting at the cruxy start is a bit spaced, while the bolting up higher on easier ground is quite close. The route could easily do with half as many bolts up higher and still be safe. Why? Why is it OK to take larger falls close to the ground on harder terrain, but smaller falls higher up where it is actually safe to fall? I may never know. At least Bob didn't put a bolt next to the crack like he has on other routes in the area. Although a blue Alien/purple Mastercam works in the crack, small to medium-size nuts are even better.

    Could be one of the best slab climbs in the Front Range, but I don't believe this deserves the rating of 11a/b, even with placing a blue Alien, still felt along the lines of 10b/c, nonetheless, amazing climb.      Post script, not knocking the climb, I think if you are shorter this could be a more strenuous climb, but there are really incredible feet as well as great finger chips to grab on the entire way...again, I think 10b/c.

    i was kind of surprised by the difficulty of this route. it has one of those stand up moves on one foot with no hands that i generally struggle with.  a #1 camalot would work really well for protecting the diagonal crack.  the smaller crack has some pods and some vegetation that might make it a little more tricky to get a good piece.  like others have said, you could probably do without the gear, but it isn't a bad idea to go ahead and place it if you can.

    This is a classic no matter the area, it's good to see smart bolting on a route in Boulder Canyon. Toward the top there is a ledge stance which kinda takes away from this being a five star route, but the bottom 2/3 has really fun slab moves. 11a.

    Sweet Route BobD/Vaino!!  I am one of those short persons, at 5'4".  I had to make a shitty left foot smear to get to the left hand crimp (it took me a couple of tries high stepping w/ the right to figure this out).  Then, the move to the crack I had to let go of the rock and just teeter over 'til I could make a last second thrutch for the crack.  From the ground, we thought the roof would be most difficult, but after all the slabbing down low the roof felt easy on big holds.  We didn't know what this route was named or graded before we tried it.  That seemed to make it much more intimidating.  Before my partner went up,I said that it was probably 11a/b.  Good guess I guess ;-)  I think that's pretty right on!!

    I think this is a great route. I really like balancy slab routes and this one definitely fits this category. I think 11a is appropriate, especially for taller people. Moving at the second bolt requires a pretty far but decent left hand crimper. I'm 5'11'' and I barely reached it. My buddy was an inch shorter and he had to add a pretty crappy foot move. Just watch it as you're going for that really big ledge just before the anchors, some loose stuff there. I ripped off a hold and took a nice 15 footer, so be careful. Otherwise, highly recommended.

    Fantastic climb, thanks Bob and Vaino.  I had a raging calf-pump going by the time I reached the crack (I found the moves not only thin and balancy but difficult to decipher), and I was *very* happy to plug in a cam.

    RE Tony's comment about the gear: If hanging off a jug and placing a small TCU feels like 5.10, the moves getting to the next bolt will definitely not feel like 5.8.

I've done this route four or five times and consider placing the piece a lot more casual than going without.

    Good climb if you like small crimping. Actually, pretty good climb if you don't, but you probably won't on-sight it- because that's what kind of climb it is.  I like this route, which seemed to be a cosmic premeditated revenge upon me for downgrading everything else at the cliff. You are going to 'nickle and dime' your way up the route, so take the appropriate shoes.    If you like thin climbing (Eldo climbers, think 'Gravity's Angel' or 'Prince of Darkness') and want a bolt at your chest for the crux, this is 2*'s if you don't like thin stuff, it's one.    Harder than Bobsled, Sleepless in Boulder, Tooth Fairy, etc... At 5'10" and even with a +6" ape index, I was 2" from the crux hold from the good stance, so I still had to do a significant move. I toe hooked and went sideways to hit it static with the right (wrong) hand and had to piano switch to get to the big move right. I was wearing shoes that my foot literally hangs out the side of... but I think it's hard in any shoes- maybe VERY HARD for shorter people.    If all you brought was draws and no gear- no fear. The moves above where you'd make the placement are not that hard and the distance to the next bolt is not severe. This line goes pretty mellow without any trad gear. It's still not S. I took a cam at the suggestion of a pal, but it was easier to do 5.8 move than to try to place the cam and clip it from a 5.10 stance since the bolt was just left of my feet.

    This route is truly one of the best slab climbs in the area. Bring one thin finger-size piece for the crack or face a fairly scary but moderate stretch for the third bolt. Superb rock and excellent climbing, only slightly marred by the last ledge.  A must-do.

    This climb has been one of my favorites, having climbed it many times. The amazing quartz system followed by steep climbing through a strenuous bulge offers some of the best climbing in Lower Dream Canyon.    I just repeated it &amp; didn't find a loose sidepull. I am assuming Eric is talking about the good lieback hold in the shallow crack system that you clip the 5th bolt from. At this point, there are two ways to go. I go left to a flat edge then up to the undercling flake. It also goes up slightly right &amp; then underclings back left.    As for the belayer, don't tie in with a daisy chain to the belay bolt. I tie in to the belay bolt with the end of the rope &amp; 8-10 feet of slack, so I can stand directly below the 1st protection bolt. This way you are out of the line of fire should anything break.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    The last good right sidepull (right before the real business), feels like it's gonna break -- it doesn't move, but I could hear/feel this thing feeling like it's ready to blow.    It would suck if this hold broke, because it could not only make this climb much harder, but worse is that the bolt at the bottom for your belayer to tie into would be right in the line of fire.    Basically, I would recommend not belaying off the convenience bolt or at the very least protect your noggin'.    Anyways, this climb rules, have fun!

    What a neat route.  The climbing on this is really fun, the quartz cubes are unique.  Very well-protected and the moves flow nicely.  After getting through the first part of the crux, I thought it was in the bag, but it keeps a consistent level of difficulty for a bit.  I could see 11d or 12a either way without too much argument.  Might be easier on a cool dry day.  Highly recommended.    Easiest way to get your draws back is to TR it and clean on the way up.  I tried to grab them on the way down, but the route is steep and traverses a fair amount.
    Aug 1, 2012

    I managed two unlikely tasks- somehow climbing past the crux bolt, mandating a sketchy reach down and left to clip, and then getting the rope stuck when I pulled it down! Neither recommended.  Nevertheless a fascinating geological feature, a must climb for that reason alone.

    Having ticked pretty much all routes at Plotinus Wall, this is the one of the last that I did today. Very interesting and easy climbing all the way up to the crux. You can get a good rest right before the crux and the first half of the route in the quartz-filled corner can be made significantly easier if you get creative with the stemming and liebacking.  The crux has some funky high undercling moves that felt a bit desperate, but fun and well bolted. I used a hold out right and did a gaston to reach the undercling easier.  I completely missed this hold my first time on the route but felt significantly easier the second time when I found it. Overall, a great route. As other people have said, it's gonna take some time to clean up since it's fairly new. Some of the quartz foot holds seem rotten and I had a buddy bring down a fairly large-sized block in the last month or so. So, be careful on the belay! Enjoy....

    Finally a repoint!!!  Couldn't even do the moves last fall.    One guy in our party knocked some very large crystals down, so be careful here belaying or sitting under someone climbing.

    I found the clip right after getting out of the quartz to be really difficult and tenuous.  Maybe I was clipping from the wrong stance, but it just seemed like there was one good edge off to the left you use to get out of the crack, and then a dicey stance to clip from...  It'll go soon (I hate having to always say that :)

    Good climb. As Dougald said, this climb seems to be unique in the area. I've personally never climbed anything like it. nickle to fist-sized chunks of quartz litter the ground below, and the system in and of itself is going through a diagonal swath of quartz 6 feet wide. Somewhat of a surprise that the miners didin't get into that years ago, as quartz bands are usually co-located with sought-after minerals and metals...  A few small quartz flakes blew out under my feet, and under the feet of Peter, who followed it. Nothing large or dangerous, and nothing that caused a fall. The climb is still cleaning up and it will take some time, but the significant holds are pretty solid already.  That said, the route is fun. The crux comes when you step out of the quartz onto the granite underclings, then up and over. The feet are hard to find and the moves extended enough to be a gut-buster.  The 'crux move' is a "a hold must have broke off" move now, although that made the climb easier, not harder.  On my ascent I tried to pinch a little flake under the sloping undercling -- it moved significantly (nice fall produced). I went back up to it and removed it completely with a simple pull.  The crux hold is actually now more secure/square.    I have to give it an extra star for the overall oddity. The moves alone are 3-star, but the climb goes into a bonus round for the rock.    Easier now that the crux hold changed.

    I'm surprised this route doesn't get more raves. I thought it was excellent!  The diagonal traverse up the quartz dike is unique in the canyon, and the crux is very interesting. Hint: It seemed easier to me to start the crux up and right, then move back left.

    Good mixed climb. Bottom 2/3 eats stoppers or cams. Good fun.  If the trad line wne the whole way, it would be of a more continuous style and thus a better climb, or the same may be said if the top 1/3 of sport were more continuous, but neither of those is what nature gave us, so the extended nature of the two combined offer the best option.THe climb has a single crux of ~10+/11- climbing and then a balancy move up top, where a tiny TCU can add 1 pcs pro (if you are squeemish) but the fall would be safe anyway.

    Young Doug-If you start by clipping the 1st bolt on S.D., and head straight up past a patina-like knob, it is better than messing with the corner at the start of the pitch.  used a tcu in the horizontal crack to protect the awkward moves onto the face.

    There's a new(?) two bolt anchor at the foot of the Sominex/Sleep Deprivation Slab. It can be reached by a short trad pitch beginning on the Rama-to-Sleep Deprivation traverse ledge or, as Peter suggests, by third-classing up and left from the far right side of the traverse ledge. The two bolts to the right of the anchor are the start (and crux) of Sleep Deprivation, not Sominex. Sominex starts in the left-facing, roof-capped corner left of the anchor. There's a good I 1/2 Friend placement in the horizontal crack that extends right from the edge of the roof . After placing the piece, step up and right to clip the first bolt on Sominex.

    Is the bolt line on Sleep Deprivation supposed to be completely separate from the bolt line on Sominex?  My partner clipped the first two bolts of Sominex, then branched right to Sleep Deprivation, clipping 6 bolts in all.

    I'd like to second that. Doing these routes in one long lead is asking for heinous rope drag. It's probably better to go up easy looking rock to the right (fixed sling?) and set up a belay.

    At first glance, this route looks like a piece of Sh&amp;* compared to all of the amazing rock formations around it including Plotinus Wall, Berlin Wall, and Wall of Winter Warmth. However, this climb is actually really fun on bullet hard/ near perfect granite. This is really fun slab climbing that will test out your skills of smearing and standing on nothing and also having virtually no hand holds throughout the middle. I was quite impressed with the quality of this route despite it not getting very high ratings or looking that impressive from the ground. I guarantee if you do it you will think differently as well. In fact, the only reason I even got on the route is because my buddy got shut down on the last bolt before the anchor.  I have also seen bail biners on numerous occasions on the same bolt that my buddy bailed on. I still managed to get the onsight, though! The key hear is to trust your feet. Cooler temps are probably a must, as this would probably climb more like 12+ in hot conditions. If you are in the area or headed to Wall of Winter Warmth or Berlin Wall, it's worth getting on.

    In contrast to the comment by J. Albers above, I suspect that most local climbers are NOT at all in agreement with bolting next to established lines, and especially run out classics like Left Side. Actions like this are generally considered tasteless and not OK.      Many routes done in Boulder Canyon are offensive to many climbers, including bolting next to excellent cracks or other good natural protection, bolting too close to established lines, and chipping and gluing holds.  Fortunately, places like Eldorado Canyon and the Flatirons have bolt review committees that engage the public and confirm that the community interests are well-served.  It would be nice if climbers could organize and get involved with community oversight of new routes in Boulder Canyon, to help keep things reasonable and in the consensus of the community.

Really? Please leave the route as is.    And just FYI, I am guessing that nobody is going to give you Bob D's contact info. Wanna know why? I'll let you in on a little secret....Bob removed himself from the website years ago because of conflicts like the one you are inevitably starting here in the comments section of AoR. Seriously, I am not trying to belittle you because of your age, but perhaps give a little thought to the possibility that other more senior people in the community have considered the value (or lack thereof) of the bolts on AoR and decided to leave it alone. In other words, perhaps you should defer to the judgement of folks who have been around a bit longer instead of assuming that your judgement is novel, justified, and appreciated.

    I agree with Drew's comments.  We'd been challenged by the classic Left Side, with its devious moves and relatively sparse pro, when all of a sudden I ran into bolts, so close I could clip them from the crack feature I was working my way up, around the middle of the 3rd pitch.  Very weak to have a bolted sport route force its way right into a tricky section of a good trad route.  Not only these two bolts next to the crack but also the anchor bolts, which totally change the character of that part of Left Side.  Disappointing.

    I've climbed the 1st pitch and the dyno is slightly Sharma-esque. 5' leap to a glued on jug... total Hollywood move! good luck....           I'm very disappointed  where the anchors were placed on top of the 2nd pitch. The 2-bolt anchor has DEFACED!  the classic 3rd pitch of the "LEFT SIDE" route. The 3rd pitch of the "Left Side" climbs that airy traverse above the lip of the huge roof and up an awesome 5.9 crack. At the top of the 5.9 crack, used to be a heady friction move, to gain the roof above where you can get gear to continue to the top. NOW, at the top of the crack there are 2 bolts right in front of your face. Instead of leaving the crack, with a nut below your feet, and smearing moves to the roof... There has been 2 bolts thoughtlessly placed in the middle of a CLASSIC ROUTE. I know Boulder Canyon is a great place for thoughtlessly placed bolts and I should get over it BUT.......this is unacceptable! I wish people would think before they drill....

We did a (new?) bolted route as the approach pitch that starts at the big pine tree to the right of the 5.9 slot.  Climb past 4 bolts and then traverse up and left towards the base of Angle of Repose.  You can also sling a horn midway so that you can do the approach pitch with no gear.

    Pretty nice climb.  Its on the west face, so it not as warm as you might hope given the formation's name.  The two pitches are very different in character... the first, steep and juggy, with the second, slabby with friction being key.  V3? dyno to start the first pitch.  I thought overall, the second pitch was unquestionably harder than the first, especially with the fact that the two cruxy sections involve friction on quite flakey/licheny rock.Weird moves.  Solid 12a, I thought, though with some more cleaning the friction might be more reasonable.  Watch the ends of your rope if you rap from the top of P2 to base of P1, and also on the rap down to the ledges at the base.  Small rack of cams with a #1 and #2 Camalot for the 5.9 approach slot.

    We accessed this route by climbing the Berlin Wall (Fall of the Wall), and then downclimbing the gully to the start.

    If there was a Pulitzer Prize for routes, I'd nominate Bob D'Antonio for finding things that are classic in ground already well traveled. Now with that preface, I'd have to say that Angle of Repose, while a very interesting route, is also one of the weirdest routes in Boulder Canyon. On the one hand, it is very appealing because over its three pitches it seems to be going somewhere - a bit unusual for a sport route. On the other hand, it has some pretty weird sequences.     The approach is the trad line "The Slot" which at 5.9 seemed stout for the grade, and it needs a double bolt anchor at the lower ledge for rappel purposes. Angle of Repose proper begins from a double-bolt stance at the top of The Slot and above a stunningly loose and cobble-filled slot. This is a warning to be careful!!     P1 of Angle of Repose starts with a nice ballistic dyno to a very sharp edge that has been glued back in place (N.B. we filed off the sharpest part of the edge). This is followed by a reachy gaston and some pumpy moves in largely juggy, interesting terrain. Cop a rest between moves and this comes together nicely.     P2 is the weirdness. It took a bit to suss out the beta, shortly after the start, which is a tad inobvious, and I won't give it away. Things got a bit weird again somewhere near the 30' mark where we went up to a clip and then dropped back down for half a dozen feet to set up a traverse left on disappearing feet that coupled with a totter onto a good fin. Swim up the small fin to a nearly invisible jug and pull into a shallow corner for the route's only significant runout. And it's all 5.7 after that.     I'd go with three stars (two for the route, one for the weirdness) as well. Good solid rock, although it needs some serious flake removal, nicely designed pro, and a killer setting. The unusual hangers look as though you could rap from almost any point without fear of trashing the rope. The slightly surrealistic turrets at the top add to the line's appeal. Kudos to Bob and Vaino.

There are short crux sections with tons of no hands rest and plenty of gear opportunities. A standard rack to a #3 is plenty, but I did find having a set of offset master cams very helpful. Each pitch has different climbing and cool holds (chickenheads, jugs, perfect layback flake, thin face). I approached from the Upper Dream lot, working down to the river, and to the base. It's a short walk back to the car from the top, just watch for private property lines. Do it!

If anyone does take over this  site I pray that they can save it from you nutjobs.  Here is an idea, go climbing, come back home rest and reflect  and when your fingers have the strength, type up some good info on the routes you did. Let people know the conditions, how the route was, rap stations,,, stuff like that.  Do you guys wonder why the site moderator is calling it quits right after he complained about receiving 600 emails from tattletales about  jerks.

    Another go-nowhere thread on a go-nowhere topic.  Nobody is going to agree on this folks- haven't we learned that lesson?    For example, let me argue both sides on a couple of issues.      To start, let me argue the route had been done before, and counter some of Bob's points regarding consulting with local authorities, and the condition he perceived the line to be in when he first got on it::    Although Jim, Richard, and others are indeed authorities on local climbing, nobody holds the crystal ball recording every passage of every potential line on every crag. Furthermore, dirt, lichen, loose rock etc. on a line is in no way conclusive evidence that the line is unclimbed- have you ever climbed in the Black Canyon, or even on some of the obscure pitches in Eldo?  By the same token, the absence of fixed gear, or even a lack of suitable cracks in which to place removeable gear doesn't mean you are on virgin rock (people were onsight soloing FAs of 5.10 in the '70s, if you recall).  Nor does a tired statement like "we cleaned all the protection placements when we did the route" mean much; any competent trad leader on fuzzy rock knows how to clean placements out of dirty cracks.  If Bob is saying he cleaned these placements with a more aggressive methodology, I would then accuse him of chipping the route.  Indeed, the complete lack of any sign of passage does not indicate the line is virgin.    Now let me argue Bob's point that he did the FA of this route:    If a particular line has never been reported or documented in a guidebook or website, and prolific local climbers are unaware of the route- if indeed there is a complete absence of information in any form regarding it- and if first hand observation leads an experienced (potential) first ascent party to believe the line has not been climbed, long-held climbing protocol legitimizes calling a (potential) ascent the First Ascent.      How about arguing style and bolt placements/locations of a FA?    A first ascent may be approached in any of several styles: ground up with traditional gear, as a rehearsed headpoint, ground-up using bolts, cleaning and placing bolts on rappel, or as a free solo.  Each of these approaches is legitimate, but take your pick, it would be easy to find fault (or logic) in any of them.     How about bolt placements regarding this route?    The "modern" approach to establishing bolted climbs often entails following a line that may or may not be as direct, logical, or in any way similar to one chosen by a climber onsighting with a rack of cams and wires.  Often, when putting in a bolted line a climber will choose the more direct, cleaner, and often more sustained path.  This results in many fine sport climbs that present future climbers with the ingredients- difficulty, deviousness, problem solving, a killer pump- that make sport climbing so appealing and popular.      But what about those pesky trad climbers?    Well, from the strict traditionalist's perspective, the result (of the aforementioned sport-bolted line) may be a less "natural", overbolted, contrived, worthless tripe heap.  It may offend their sensibilities, esthetics, or their belief that rock is a limited resource, that style is critical, i.e. the whole argument that climbing is more than gymnastic movement, that it entails risk and calculation, etc., etc.      So, here we have another round robin go-nowhere argument with people getting a little too worked up.  I understand Ivan's logical argument.  I understand Bob's defense of his route.    In this specific example, a route was climbed in the '70s by someone who did not report it (I would give Ken et al full credit for their statements...innocent until proved guilty, eh?).  Then, 25 friggin' years later, a potentially popular sport climb has been established on this small crag in a heavily traveled climbing area.  Not everyone will dig this route, but many certainly will.      This route is insignificant, folks.  Follow the Middle Path- there will never be agreement between either side of a debate perpetuated by those who hold their personal beliefs infallible, who are unyielding, who believe they are "right".    There are many fine climbs to do in Boulder Canyon- both traditional and sport.  If you find some bolted route offensive because you personally can eliminate clips, by all means feel offended, skip the clips and finish the climb.  Then walk away.      Likewise, if you find some under-protected traditional climb offensive because, in your view, it is dangerous and foolish, respect someone else's foolishness (i.e. do not retro bolt the line), walk away and find something else to climb.      Fortunately, Boulder Canyon has a rich tradition in both traditional and sport climbing, and there is a ton to climb there.  Get out there and climb, and have a safe and fantastic time doing it. Nobody is right here, folks.  Apples and oranges.      I really liked the post a while back suggesting the "mixed" rack approach to climbs, and questioning why this did not happen in B. Cyn.  If there is gear, don't place a bolt, and record it as a mixed route so people will carry gear on it (several routes on Easter, Bell etc could be done this way).  Oh well, who knows....

    For what it is worth, I would advise Bob D. to believe Ken's account of his climbing. While he was my partner, he was not only always honest about his abilities but of his previous experiences; which were many I guarantee! It's a wonder Ken didn't document the very days (yes, plural) he spent on this route in the past, since like most climbers, he kept quite accurate diaries of his adventures. Overall, a very competent climber at the 5.10 level on traditional routes in the past, he now seems to be doing some harder routes while enjoying the security of some of the newer bolted routes. Also; I will attest to the Platte being a very special place to both Ken and myself and believe Ken when he said he had nothing to do with Bucksnort.

    To beat this dead horse again...Bob's 1st pitch variation is better than the old obscure way of traversing in from the far right, overbolted or not. Regardless of  the bolt placements or who did the 1st free ascent of the sentrybox this is a great pitch. Bobby D's all right with me....

    Bob said: Funny how Ivan can critique and criticize these new routes with the luxury of fixed protection in place. Doesn't matter if he use the gear or not, just knowing it is there and available makes it so much easier.    That may be true in general, but on Direct Copout the new bolts are in places that are totally unnecessary. P1 is ridiculous. The gear is excellent. P2 the new bolts are at the belay (is Bob suggesting we could quickly clip the new bolt as the belay is failing?), and at the crux where there is excellent gear a few feet below and decent although small gear almost even with the bolts. The only place the gear is the least bit sketchy is at the traverse right past the old bolt and the next move or two up, and, for some reason, Bob and Co. did not place a new bolt here.    Ivan

    I must confess to a bit of confusion here.  Maybe I'm missing something, but from reading Bob D's own description, it sounds as though there was fixed protection already in place on every pitch when he first climbed the route on the alleged first ascent.  Bob, or anyone, if your ascent truly was the first, then what would explain the presence of the old bolts?  Why wouldn't you just assume that the route had previously been climbed.  The bolts don't sounds like rap anchors.  I'm not trying to be a jerk, I'm just curious.    Also, just an FYI, I'm writing from the Boulder Library, so it would be a waste of anyone's  time to try to trace my identity.

    I think it's silly that there aren't more mixed sport/trad routes in Boulder Canyon.  The rock is very fitting for it, with some cracks and some faces.  I know there are some crack-routes around that have bolts, with the argument that "it is a sport area, and some people wouldn't know to bring gear" and there are trad routes that are run out because no one wants them to be mixed seems silly.  I've been to sport areas where cracks are left alone, and discontinuous routes become "mixed" with some trad pro and some bolts.  It seems to work very well, the routes are described as mixed in the guides, and everyone who can't place a nut steers clear. I am not anti bolt or pro bolt, I think there is a grey area we are all missing.  Why not have more mixed routes?  Also, if the ascentionists (1st, last, 1st in 20 years, etc.) had to clean a bunch of lichen and loose choss, it would be fitting for them to think they were the first. I'm surprised that Ken H. isn't devoting his attention to "Rosy Cruxifiction" or other Eldo routes with bolts.  It would seem like a better place to cry about than Boulder Canyon or the S. Platte.

    This ethical debate is interesting, but I don't want to get involved.

    Jan 10, 2005

    Good route, but it should have been trad. We climbed it without clipping any of the bolts, with the only gear difficulty being in the vicinity of the old bolt in the middle of P2.    P1 has excellent gear near the bolts, except that pulling the ceiling the gear is underneath and a bit left. But the holds are huge, and it would be nearly impossible to fall, besides being only about 5.8. The old bolt at the belay directly above the ceiling may indicate that this obvious pitch (obvious due to the big horn at the lip) may have been climbed before.    The P1 belay gear was 3 micro cams, a 0.5 Camalot, and a medium nut, all excellent. However they are all in a 6" section of crack, so the anchor might seem a bit unnerving given the difficult climbing above. Perhaps one new bolt at this belay would have made sense, especially since it could be justified as replacing the existing 1/4" bolt.    P2 is a a tad spicy and trad (no old or new bolts) until a step right at an old 1/4" bolt. Had I clipped this bolt, I would have much preferred this bolt be replaced rather than placing the 2 new bolts higher up. Hard moves gain a finger crack right of this old bolt and fair-to-good gear gets you to a good stance at the steep right-facing corner. There are 2 new bolts here, both unnecessary. There is excellent gear below the lower bolt, and a good but small brass nut just a little lower than the upper bolt. The crux moves here are perplexing. You could escape left below the roof to a big jug or perhaps escape right. Where did the people that placed that 1/4" bolt go? And how much of this pitch is new, given the existence of that old bolt?    P3 is moderate and somewhat runout until you get to the right-facing flake. You can climb at the old bolt up and left of the belay (gear opportunities), or climb more naturally directly above the belay and then move left. The right-facing corner has excellent gear and is quite moderate with good stances. 5.8 or easy 9. Above the ceiling, though, it's very runout on humps, but maybe only 5.6 or 5.7. It may be possible to climb left or right on easier ground.    The descent gully pretty much sucks. Very loose.

    The only part where this is above 5.9, in my opinion, is the very beginning of the crux pitch cranking into the black streak crack/slot system. The rest, is absolutely incredible climbing with tricky moves, amazing exposure, and good pro. I'm not sure why there are bolts behind the tree with the cord, it doesn't allow you to reach the ground after two raps. I rapped off the bolts under the roof at the top of the last pitch and got back to the ground with three raps.

    I can't say enough good things about this climb. Its truly an adventure. First of all, you can't figure how the %^ to pull the black streak without breaking your ankles. Then you can't figure out how to get up/out of the black streak. Then the second(third depending on how you're doing it) pitch comes and there is some thin gear on your left and reasonably incut holds until a stemmy/balancey move out right to some jugs then a fun traverse back to the anchor ledge out left. Then pull the roof and find yourself out on a face with four different possible paths and infinite combinations. Just start climbing and plugging gear where you can. There are some mildly large runouts on the easier third(4th) pitch, so be solid.    And have fun!

    I'm serious! The Black Groove is really hard and treacherous, and I was following. You have to struggle with the gear, because it's continually hard after you step off a big block which you don't want to land on.    The 1980 Erickson Rocky Heights guide says, "Chimney up the slot to a tree, 5.8".(!) He calls the second pitch 8+.    Pitch 2 was very good. You need to make a few moves above your gear, and it's confusing which of the two corners to use. I started right, moved left, back right and then back left.    Pitch 3 is mostly easy, with only a couple hard moves at the very top. Good gear where you need it. If it's slightly runout, it's only on really easy climbing. There's one exposed move left that's cool, as you look down on the very steep Angle of Repose (12a).    We rapped from the Angle of Repose anchors to the ground in two 2-rope rappels. Be careful if you're using just one rope. It looks like you could miss the intermediate anchors on the first rap and end up hanging in space.

    One of the longest trad routes in Boulder Canyon.  Perhaps analagous to a 5.9+ version of Bitty Buttress, pure joy, with much more excitement.  The rock is great, position incredible and moves were awesome.  A #4 Camalot came in handy on every pitch.  I experienced no run outs on P3, stemming; perhaps due to bringing a yellow/green offset Alien.  However, P4 has a substantial runout with much air, but is easier climbing.  Interesting flared cracks and grooves made for quite an adventure.  The black grooves were dry today, but still very hard for 5.9, I think it's more 5.10.

    Terrific route.  One thought on P3:  You can easily go past the statedbelay for P3 ("on the arete") another 30 feet or so.  Go left throughthe roof, around the corner, and belay next to a big bush (tricams pink/brown;camalots 3/3.5).  It makes it about a 90 foot pitch.    The advantage:  you can see your leader on the last pitch.

Awkward 9+ moves but we didn't have anything bigger than a 3.5 cam, and protected fine.  Was dry when we did it on Saturday.    P3. *** Pitch, best on the route. I found a few 'solid RPs' below the dihedral.  BOMBER blue Alien at the start of the dihedral.  One can sew up the rest with nuts and TCUs.  Great rock and elegant moves through this pitch. Fabulous exposure. 9+    P4. Going left through the small roof can be protected with a blue TCU and then a #1 rock in the corner near the roof. Look for good holds left as you crank around the corner.  This is a long wandering (some run-outs on 5.7 climbing) pitch to the second pitch anchors of Angle of Repose.

    Charles,    I had the same question about this area when I visited it the first time; I don't have any "concrete" land rules, only my experience to share (as well as my own opinions - he-he).  So here it is: In the number of times I've been there I've never had an issue with crossing the "cross or die" signs going up the hill past the erosion breaks.  And I guess that goes with the quantities of others through the ages who have crossed the signs in the past to put up all the routes in the narrow canyon beyond the falls.      I'm left with one conclusion why they are there: did you happen to see the hundreds of sightseers, gawkers and idiots on the tourist trail?  Isn't it a rush to be so close to nature with hundreds of your brethren?  Truly a transcendent experience if you ever get the chance to watch these idiots frolic in and around the falls.  I think the signs are to prevent these lemmings from harming themselves by climbing up above the falls and invariable falling from the cliffs above.  Even with the signs, land lubbors still seem to get themselves in over their heads in the area way too often.     Also (here's my cynical opinionated side coming through) you know that with the throngs available, if the signs weren't there, it would be the perfect invite to wreck the canyon beyond the falls.  If they saw how beautiful the canyon is, how strangely detached from the crowds below, how majestic the Plotinus wall, Wall of WW and adjacent domes make the canyon feel, well, it would be overrun with Easter Eggs with legs and aggro tourists.  Simply put, those in the know walk by undeterred, the tourists look on in disbelief and have something to point their digital video cameras at as they film your ass ducking through the Keyhole.  For the time being, the only folks you'll see above the falls are other crazy climbers and Boulder locals, and that's just fine with me.     The Cone shaped wall proudly standing above the falls IS the WWW (it's an optical illusion, the wall is up the canyon a bit, it just looks like it rises from the creek).  It really is impressive looking - like the Vampire, only this thing looks like good rock - and it mostly is!    Finally, go do this damn route!  It's awesome!  And if it gets climbed enough with gear, maybe it won't get bolted (snicker, snicker).

Michael or others, care to comment?    Also, is the wall visible from the Falls (I chose to obey the 4+ signs and not scramble up the hill)?

    Crusher and I climbed this classic route in perfect fall conditions in late October, 2002.  Bring a #4 Friend for the crux groove; there's a fine hold that's hidden at its top but was otherwise poorly protected without big gear.  We both thought this section was trad 5.10.    The two upper pitches are also quite serious climbing with lots of hard 5.9 moves away from good protection.  On the final pitch, I traversed directly right on the unprotected section in the middle to gain a good groove, and thought the final crack moves at the top were also in the 5.10 range.    Anywhere else but Boulder, this climb would get 5.10b s.  In Boulder Canyon, it's a three star 5.9+. Wear a helmet on this one; we did.

    I think this was a great find - snuck in between some old, established routes on a big wall (by Boulder Canyon standards anyway). I would agree with Dana that the bolt underneath the third roof is not ideally located, and it would be a lot better if it were moved. Especially since, as Seth said, that the big feature under the final roof is going to break sooner rather than later.

    Great route - technical in spots and thuggish in others.  Definitely thought provoking and worthwhile.  The first pitch has some difficult slab moves - I broke the crystal at the fourth bolt.  The area between the third and fourth bolts seemed to have some crumbly texture, a lot of which came off under my feet.  As the route continues to clean up it's sure to improve (and possibly get harder).  Be careful with the plate under the crux roof, it's ready to pitch, though it has a great jug... too bad.  The roof move is pretty hard to get onsight but really cool. The second pitch is pure fun, I think 10- is a fair grade.  I think the route protects pretty well.  Certainly not overbolted, but perfectly safe.  BC needs some more bolting like this... the general overbolting in the canyon is making me soft.  Overall it's a great route!      D - my compliments... Not only did you eye an excellent route, but you can kick some mean linear algebra knowledge.  Here's one for you - does the crack below the second roof span the range of Camalots; that is, is the crack a linear combination of the cams on my rack?  Cheers!     Thanks all!

    We've bumped the rating up to 5.11 from 5.11-.  Also, we've bumped the rating of the 2nd pitch up to 5.10- from 5.9.  Everyone I know that has climbed the route, thought that it was harder than its original rating.  The original rating was an attempt to be more consistent with the ratings on the rest of the wall and to battle grade inflation.  There are routes up canyon rated 5.11d that are probably easier than this route.  In addition, we've decided to give the route a PG13 rating.  There are a few places on this route where you are doing solid 5.10 moves a bit above small gear or a bolt.      The last bolt below the big roof on the 1st pitch is poorly located.  It is hard to see and not very useful.  We'll go back in the spring and move this bolt.  Depending on where we move it to, we may add another above or below the current location of this bolt.  However, it'll do just fine for now.    I think that this route is excellent, but it has one serious weakness.  There are a couple of places on both pitches where you have to fight the temptation to wander onto nearby routes and easier terrain.  The position on this route is magnificent.    You can also hit the upper pitches of "Direct" and "Right Side" from the anchors at the top of pitch one.  These are excellent crack pitches.  In particular, this is a much better way to get to the 2nd pitch of "Right Side"...no animal feces to battle through.

    Excellent climbing, but you'd better be a solid 5.11 leader before heading up on this route; not a good one to push your limits.  I'm not a solid 5.11 leader, and I got a) scared and b) spanked.    We rapped the route and I pre-placed draws on all the bolts on the first pitch, and I still had trouble finding some of them.  There are several choices for the climbing line; I took what I thought was the path of least resistance, and I found myself well left or right of the bolts several times.  Some of the bolts are just above roofs and are hard to see from below.    Some of the pro is small, hard to find, and hard to place.  At one point I had to look around a little corner to the right to find a small slot for a blue Alien to protect a 5.9-5.10 slab move.  At the roof, I had to stretch up to place a blue/green hybrid Alien (a green would probably have worked) in the bottom of the V-notch, and then make an awkward clip.    I was mentally and physically thrashed at this point and lowered off.   I probably would have gotten toasted trying to clear the roof had I continued.  As Dana points out, the roof move is hard to aid; it's a mantel and there's no finishing jug.    I was wishing for about 3 or 4 more bolts on the pitch (OK, I'm a wuss): one several feet left of the hidden blue Alien placement, one on the 5.6-5.7 runout move to the roof, and one under the roof, about 4' left of the V-notch. And another at the top of a right-facing corner with guano (the bolt was out on the slab to the left).  But if you're a solid 5.11 leader, you'd probably feel the extra bolts weren't necessary.    The second pitch looked like fun, knobby face climbing at a much easier grade than the first pitch (I didn't climb it).  I'll have to go back, rap down, and do it (and maybe top-rope the first pitch).    Thanks to Dana, Jonas, and Yvonne for their hard work putting in this quality line; I just wish I was a better climber so I could have enjoyed it a little more.

    Relax, the route cleaned up a little over the last few years- some of the holds have broken off, some becoming worse, some becoming better. I'll go with ~5.12b if done 'to the left.' The moves are pretty hard and the 3rd clip would be made from a not-so-nice crimper, or from the semi-sloper above. Definitely a heads up! It might be better just to skip it &amp; make a few more moves to the jugs and clip #4.

    This route was put up ground up by Pat and Azenda Thompson. I put the bolts in later to make a safe mixed beginner route. The name of the route is Don't Pull on the Udder. This is in relation to the big chockstone at the top of the route. I think it is solid but beware. We actually called this crag Bovine World. I used 0 TCUs and a .5 Camalot on the route. We thought the route was about 5.7.    The short hand crack 10 feet to the right also has anchors on it. It definitely does not get stars, but it was put up ground up by Gene Kissler [I am not sure of spelling] and Pat Thompson. It goes at about 5.8 through the crack and backs off to maybe 5.4 above to the anchors. We used a number 1 or 2 Camalot for the crack and TCUs and stoppers above.    Also up the hill and 20 feet to the right is another short crack with chain anchors. It starts in a right-facing dihedral and pulls the obvious roof and then ascends the short face on horizontals. You will need medium cams and TCUs for this route. I really enjoy this route, so I give it 1 star because it is so short. This route was put up ground up also, by Pat and Azenda Thompson and also Chris and Shannon Coney. We called this route Cow Patty Crack. It goes at about 5.9.

Check out the photo of the crux set-up.    Fun route. If you avoid going way left up top, then the route is NOT over after the roof.    A 60M rope just gets you to the ground.

    What a varied route! Steep slab climbing, slopers, crimps and a strenuous roof - all in 90 feet!    The scramble to the first bolt is fourth class, but beware of loose rock - my rope dislodged a pretty hefty place from the junk. This route is well bolted, pumpy and interesting all the way to the chains.

    Direct line on this is 5.10a. Old style ratings then a 5.9 to 5.9+. Very well-protected except the first bolt is a little high. Better to come from the right or use a clip stick.    Gets a lot of sun in February.

    I suspect that the folks calling this 5.7 or barely 5.8 are either on the tall side or climbed off to the left or right of the bolt line. That being said, I don't think it's 5.10, and my daughter who is 5'1" agrees. Would have been a lot more interesting as a mixed line and quite safe with 1 or 2 bolts.

    Just did this a couple of hours ago. Very fun face climbing, but I want to highlight there's a loose block precariously at the top to the left of the anchors.

    This is a nice route on mostly solid rock (one suspect flake near second bolt). We approached the first bolt on the face from the right, up a wide slot and then along a left-angling, hand-sized crack where protection can be placed. Walking the feet up this crack, with good handholds available above, seems easiest.    Rolofson's original intention for this route may have been to take a direct line right next to the fourth bolt, which looks rather difficult and would explain his 5.10 rating. We bypassed this by stepping right a couple of feet, to reach good handholds near a thin crack with a bush in it, then stepping back left. Just above this is the technical crux, the mantle-shelf maneuver to the Thank God finger pocket mentioned in the route intro (5.9-ish).    With a 60m rope you can lower all the way back to the ground; no need to scramble up to the exposed belay ledge 10 feet off the ground to start the climb.

    We ended up at this crag when trying to find Animal World also. The problem is that the approach to Animal World involves an easterly traverse along the sloping terrace just above the Boulderado, with some scrambling and a couple of slightly exposed spots. Since we were expecting more of a 'trail' to Animal World, this didn't seem quite right, so we left the terrace to head further uphill and bumped into Mine Hole Crag before we realized the error.

    I agree that this is not 5.10.  More like 5.8 with perhaps one move of 5.9.

    This is not 5.10, although it might be a bit height dependent.  At the start, it's easier to come in from the right before clipping the first bolt.  A 60m is plenty for lowering off, I think a 50m would be fine.
    Sep 20, 2004

    A couple of things: As others have pointed out, this route is not 5.10. I've taken first time climbers on this, and they've gotten up it fine on TR. 5.8 at the most but still a very fun climb. A couple of saftey precautions: be very mindful of loose rocks both on the approach and around the belay station. Also, if you decide to rap off the route to save wear and tear on your rope from the awful sloping ledge before the last bolt, be sure not to toss your rope anywhere near the nasty pine tree with lots of small dead branches that stands just to the left of the climb. It can really eat up your rope and may reqiure some toproped, licheny, 5.10 fingercracking to untangle said rope from said tree. And the mine hole is not a bathroom!

    Oh yeah, great climb.  It clearly is not 5.10, and I know this because I still struggle on many 5.9 routes, and this was pure joy.!  The only reason I would give it a 5.9 is because, like mentioned above, you can get psyched out if you don't just keep moving.  I must say, there are places where, being short, I had an intermediate move before the bolt. Those moments made it slightly challenging.  Oh, we dabbled with starting left, center and right of the line of the first bolt off the belay ledge...and each start was fun and unique.  The route is in the shade most of the morning.

    I concur with Ray's comment. Did this route today and it felt like 5.9 for the Canyon - no harder. The bolts might be a bit reachy for the more vertically challenged, but the climbing is not 5.10. Compared to Eldo, this is probably 5.7.     Great route though! Beware of loose rock and the potential for a nasty tumble getting to the first bolt!

    This route is very nice and worth doing, but no way is it 5.10-, even by Boulder Cyn standards. 5.8 at the most, and easier and safer than virtually *any* 5.8 than I can think of in Eldo. Getting started is a bit weird, though, and I agree that a 1-2" piece has a calming effect.

    I think if you hesitate you'll find this harder; fiddling around mid-sequence burns energy.  If you go with the flow (will the hold to be at your reach) you'll find the crux 9+.  Fight it and it will seem 10a.      This is a sunny climb in the afternoon on a surprising slab.  One last thing: if you want to make the first clip (which does involve a move over exposure up onto the slab) extra safe, it is possible to throw in some pro in a hand sized crack before the face.  I used a red BD hex and felt glad all over.

    Warren Shelly and I did this route on trad gear in 1997. It was likely climbed  earlier as it is the natural line. Back then, the first placements were marginal cams and nuts under the roof, making the roof moves a bit more thrilling. As Rolofson noted, it is ~80' long, on good rock, and has nice views of Castle Rock. The trad gear on this one was never all that good, but if you want some practice with marginal trad placements, bring some small cams along.

Now that it may be a better climb, I'd like to do it again.
    Aug 14, 2015

    Perhaps I am reading too much into your opinion. That said it really caught my attention to see this route rated 5.9 with a bomb for quality rating. First, the route was originally graded .10c. If you had led it with its original gear, I will bet no one would have called it 5.9. I could agree that in its original state you could bomb this route. There was a bail biner on the 3rd bolt when I led it rope solo. I went the easiest way finishing up the rotten arête. I thought there were 5.10 moves at what is now the 3rd bolt &amp; traversing to the arête finish. I retrobolted it to avoid climbing the rotten arête &amp; to stay on the face which definitely feels like solid 5.10. Perhaps the moves at the 3rd bolt have cleaned up &amp; gotten easier. So maybe following the line of least resistance is 5.9, but I have to wonder, does the protection affect the mindset of many leaders enough that the same moves receive dramatically different YDS grades? Seeing the significant downrating of the easier sport climbs at this crag makes me wonder.  Is it good for a 5.10 or 5.11 leader to downrate a 5.9 to 5.7 or 5.8- or is it an ego thing?

As you described in that clipping block pulling off, holds still crumble on this route.  A warning as such is warranted.  There are many better routes in the canyon, including many of yours, Mark.

    Yes, the name of the route is "Heat Wave", and I retro-bolted it in 2013 after leading it rope solo with its old bolts and gear.  I have since climbed the route with several people, all who enjoyed it. So, what's your problem, Leo? Traditude or just picky? Having more bolts is nice. I originally finished up the rotten arete, but I now always climb directly up the face with a crux above the last bolt.  When I retro-bolted it, I pulled off a large block that I had used as a clipping hold.  The route is safe. I used long 1/2" bolts, because the dynamited rock is softer than your typical Boulder Canyon granite.  I felt the crag deserved a 5.10 sport route, which at the time had none.

    GDW, thanks for the input.  Oddly, p 272 of Rossiter's 1999 Rock Climbing Boulder Canyon guide lists Heat Wave as having 3 bolts, protecting with RPs, climbing an arete, and being a 5.10c.  This little route climbs a face mostly, has 7 bolts, and is not 5.10.  The bolts look newer than 1999, too.  My guess is that it is newer than that.

    I'm reluctant to say a route is safe, but it seemed to me that gear is plentiful and solid. I would recommend nuts for anyone apprehensive, as they seemed extra bomber, and a bomber #3 C4 in the crack over the roof protects getting to the bolt.

    Climbing the roof line and pulling the roof are worth doing. The climbing after the bolt becomes much less worthwhile, dirty, and quite slabby with minimal protection up high.

Try it sometime, when headed to or from Frisky.

    Maybe the nicest route at the crag.    I used a #1 1/2 Friend and a #0.5 Camalot. You could place TCUs in various spots as well, if desired.    Going left at the tree/twig is really fun amongst the pegmatite, highly recommended, but beware of breakable crystals.

    I led this four or five years ago, finding only two bolts. Sounds like the third bolt wasn't worth finding. I did find lots of placements in horizontals, using C3s up through #1 Cam. So three new bolts is more than plenty.

    All 3 bolts were replaced today 8/1/15, and we added a two bolt anchor to the left of the dying tree &amp; removed all the tat off the tree (just a note - it's dying due to running out of dirt, it has nothing to do with climbers). The first two bolts were rusty 3/8" sleeve bolts (of the Lok-bolt design, e.g.  powers.com/product_06160.php - a very weak bolt even when new), and the third was a 1/4" buttonhead.     Hardware for the bolt replacement was provided by the ASCA, please support bolt replacement and donate! safeclimbing.org

    Climbed this today with my husband. We both had very different variations of the start (he's over 6 ft tall). The start stuck out the most to us. He was able to bear hug the wall to get crimps on either side of the corner sticking out and cross into the good edge above. Meanwhile, I used two crimps on the left to shoot up to the good edge above. Overall, we both had fun on this one.

    I concur with Rolfson, this is another fun climb along the Barker to Kossler Reservoirs pipeline route that was constructed in 1909. I didn't notice any chipped holds, unless you consider dynamite and pickaxe scars from 1909 to be "chipping." Regardless, the area affected by the blasting is only the bottom moves and the rest is a fun romp on solid rock. We gave it a 5.9 grade.

    Pretty funny! chipped!? Try dynamited up to 3rd bolt, to put the aqueduct in. Isn't it amazing how climbers worry about a possible chipped hold &amp; ignore the greater impacts that we humans are creating.  This route is a great addition to the crag.  Interesting slab climbing on solid rock.

    A fun climb; too bad the wide hand crack is only 15 or 20 feet long.    The climb starts with the same 2 bolts as the easier start to Excalibur, up blocky ledges on the right side of the face.  At the top of the first pitch, I got an anchor in the corner with an orange Alien, #1 Camalot and #4 C4 Camalot.    I protected the wide hand crack on the second pitch with a #3.5 Camalot and a #3 Camalot.  Using the finger crack in the corner and working the left hand and arm in the wide crack kept the difficulty at 5.9.  Above, an easier chimney led to the tree at the top of the crag.    On October 14, there were two yellow slings and a locking biner for a rap anchor at the tree.  If you can't see these slings before you start up, bring slings and rings of your own.

    This is a response to Bernard, but will serve as useful data for anyone.  MITHRIL is a very good climb, but is really too short.  Were it two or three times its length it would be a north American classic like Reed's Pinnacle.  The quality is there.  You will just wish that fat hands crack went on forever, or at least another 80 feet.  But don't despair, the other routes on this crag are really good...and longer.

    Hi Richard.  I've read the Hobbit only a couple times as well (I'm embarrassed to admit how many times I've read LOTR; it's been pretty much an annual ritual since I was a young lad), and I looked at it again to seek out the first mention of Bilbo's mithril coat (having already found one reference to Thorin's gift to Bilbo before I wrote the previous post).  In "Not at Home," it says:  "With that he [Thorin] put on Bilbo a small coat of mail, wrought for some young elf-prince long ago."  So we know at least one elf wore a mithril coat at some point (which means you're off the hook!).    It's clear it was wrought by the Dwarves in any case (per LOTR).  I've always regarded The Hobbit as separate from LOTR:  it was written many years prior to LOTR, before Tolkien had figured out his mythology.  Tolkien actually revised a few crucial passages in The Hobbit so that it fit in better with the history in LOTR (and unless you find a 1937-8 printing of The Hobbit, you've read the revised edition).  Thus I'd look to LOTR for the definitive word on mithril.    Re:  "I didn't know you had girls (two?)."  Would you believe four girls and one baby boy?!!?  It's been a while since we've crossed paths (was I even married last time I saw you?), and we've got enough at home to field a hockey team.  Imagine climbing with Raoul and 3 of his buddies, and you'll get the picture.    I'll put Mithril on my to-do list next time I'm in Boulder Canyon -- sounds like a good route.  I've always admired your gift for picking out strong lines; it's nice to see that you are still so active on the new route scene.    Bernard========

    Bernard, thanks for clearing this up.  Everyone needs an editor and I much prefer to be accurate.  I have gone through the Trilogy three times starting in 1986 and The Hobbit once.  Looks like I should have read The Hobbit  three times too.  While I was writing (too late at night as usual) "of the Elves" I was suspicious that I may have had it wrong.  Minas Tireth is just a typo, I took it right out of the book.    I didn't know you had girls (two?).  That is great and I am sure you are a great dad.  It is good to hear from you, even indirectly.    Kindest Regards.  Richard Rossiter

    Hi Richard - I can't let this one go without a friendly comment from a fellow JRR Tolkien fan. "Mithril, as any JRR Tolkien fan knows, is the legendary chainmail armor of the Elves worn by Frodo in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. "    Mithril was mined by the Dwarves; it could be found only in Moria ("Moria-silver, or true-silver as some have called it:  mithril is the Elvish name.  The Dwarves have a name which they do not tell." (1))  "The Elves dearly loved it, and among many uses they made of it ithildin, starmoon, which you saw upon the doors."(2)  Gandalf is speaking in both of these quotes, and the doors to which he refers are the east doors of Moria, which were inlaid with ithildin.    It may be that the Elves used mithril for chainmail (though I doubt it), but the mithril coat that Frodo wears was definitely made by the Dwarves.  Thorin gave it to Bilbo in "The Hobbit".  Bilbo then gives it to Frodo in Rivendell, just before the Company leaves on its long journey to Mordor.  Frodo loses it in the tower of Cirith Ungol (Shagrat gets off with it), and then Gandalf takes it from the Mouth of Sauron at the Black Gate ("Dwarf-coat, elf-cloak, and blade of the downfallen West..." (3)).  It is returned to Frodo in the Field of Cormallen ("Then Gandalf came and in his arms, to the wonder of Frodo, he bore the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had been taken from him in Mordor."  (4))    Mithril, then, is not chainmail armor; it is only used to make it ("...the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered steel." (5)).  It really isn't "of the Elves," either, because the Dwarves mined it (and likely traded it or gave some of it to the Elves).  At the time of the story, most of it was in the hands of Sauron:  "Of what they [the Dwarves] have brought to light, the Orcs have gathered nearly all, and given it in tribute to Sauron, who covets it.  Mithril!  All folks desired it..." (6))      When the climbing companies get some mithril, we can all expect stronger and lighter biners, though that [presupposes] they will be able to locate some dwarves who can help them forge it correctly.  I'm waiting for the day when we can purchase Elven rope (leading the Diamond on a lithe 5mm rope would be sweet).  Of course, free climbing standards will shoot through the roof if the scientists can locate some Gollum DNA and bring him back to life.    (1) (2) (5) (6) -- See "A Journey in the Dark," Book II, The Fellowhip of the Ring (3) -- See "The Black Gate Opens," Book V, The Return of the King (this quote tells you it's a dwarf coat, but you already learn that in The Hobbit) (4) -- See "The Field of Cormallen," Book VI, The Return of the King    You might also want to change the spelling of one of your routes on Watermark (on this site and your own).  It's "Minas Tirith," not "Minas Tireth."    Nice route names, though.  I just put up "The Sword-that-was-Broken," (5.3 **) and "Ring of Power," (5.4 *) with my girls a few weeks ago.  These were inaugural FAs for the kids, and Katie (my 8-yr old, who finished The Lord of the Rings last spring) suggested the names, so I went with them.  (Anyone who wants a friendly place to climb with the kids:  you'll find these routes on the slab left of Git-em Up Scout on Scout Slab, opposite Scout Rock in SSV Canyon -- these landmarks are all listed on this site.  Very close to the road, so super short approach, but far enough away from the road that traffic is not a danger.  Two bolts and gear on the left line to hidden chains at 60 feet; the right line -- Ring of Power -- goes to the same anchor and can be led or top roped, with a 5.6 R/X variant finish on the arete.  The kids didn't do the arete finish; it'd be 5.11 for them due to lack of reach.  There's a ratings debate this site hasn't seen yet:  how to rate climbs for six year olds who are 41 inches tall).

    An excellent and sustained route; one of the best sport pitches at this grade that I've done in Boulder Canyon.    There's a tricky move just getting started at the first bolt.    I removed some loose rock on the ledge between the second and third bolts. There still is a small loose block in the corner on this ledge, but it would require a prybar to remove.    Above, sustained interesting stemming and  chimneying led to the top of the V-slot, where there is a committing layback exit left at the fifth bolt. This bolt is around the corner out of sight until you start into the layback; look for it and make the clip before pulling the move.    The final steep headwall also has some hard moves. I got gray and yellow Aliens in horizontal cracks between the sixth and seventh bolts. The moves straight up past the last bolt looked very hard, so I went left to a hand crack and battled past a little bush before angling back right to the anchor.

    I was going to downgrade this to 11-, but after ripping off the starting foothold, the crimp on the starting handhold, the second handhold, the undercling, and part of the edge of the fingerlock, I think it might be harder now.  I was scarcely able to hold on with each broken hold, and falling off that first foothold (can't clip before it) could have injured me pretty badly.  I tried to clean up what was left of it (now 4" lower down) to avoid anyone else breaking their back falling 1/2 way on/off of the starting ledge.    As a result of my experience, my opinion of the route quality reflects the rock quality.

From the ledge, I can barely reach the totally horrible, right hand slimper...smear the left foot and bump the left hand to the unique sidepull...but make sure you use the thumb catch, so it's more like a pinch...then comes the hard part...the left foot smear made me fall repeatedly, so instead I basically do a pullup off the slimper and pinch combo to the high right foot...which is also terrible...then get the left foot over the roof and make a desperate right hand bump to the sharp flake-like hold...find a better right foot and then go to a series of good hands to the anchors...totally awesome!

    I could not stick the "paste high and reach" beta at the crux, but here is an alternative sequence that worked for me.

    This one is superhard.  I ended up going right to the finger crack and then lowering and doing the crux on TR.  I do have some beta.  Fortunately, I can reach up to the crappy right crimper and then bump my left hand to the sidepull before the right smears off.  It's hard to see from below, but there is a hole by the sidepull that you can put your left thumb in.  This is key:  now you can squeeze with the left hand which is significantly better than using the sidepull alone.  Then, I get the left foot on lame almost-vertical edge under the roof and get the right foot up on an infitesimal nubbin.  Then the left foot goes up to a smear over the roof.  I have to use the left knee for balance just to get the left foot there.  Now, you have two crappy feet, a crappy right hand, and a just somewhat-poor squeeze with the left hand.  Now, go for the top of the ear (not big) with the right, get the right foot up to a small ledge below the bolt, and you are done.

    So this is what a 5.12 feels like, huh??? Ouch. I like the above comment of paste your feet high... There really isn't a defined feature upon which one must place such a paste.     Shameless Beta. Beware!!! Left foot goes on the tiny vertical crimp (you can see it plainly from the roof-rest pedestal), then get your lieback on, reach for the crappy positive crimp, then smear the right foot wherever you can. Power up to the small "ear-looking" feature with your hands (I had to be a little dynamic with this) and put your right foot on a thank-God tiny but long-ish ledge that is colored with lichen. I didn't really use the sidepull much to get over the roof. I just used it for stability AFTER getting over.     Do what you will. I don't think I'll ever be leading trad .12s if this is par for the course. Freakin' hard. Props to those who can OS this crap... (Up to the crux IS REALLY fun though)~Wm

    Tony, I've read other comments of yours that state you have pretty long arms.  While I found similar to you that this climb was more or less impossible to me, it was actually because no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't reach the crimp beyond the roof.  I climb all of the route alright until the roof, where I past my feet as Kristo said and reach hard, falling short by almost a foot.  I don't know if you had the same difficulties as me, given your long arms, but I, too, think this climb has to be extremely relative in grade unlike many others.

    This is a great route. The crux is very well defined and you know to save the juice for this part.

    May 20, 2002

    This route, I believe is at least a 10b maybe c if you  continue up, staying a bit to the right just beneath the  last bolt instead of moving left around the arete then  going up and finally coming back around to the right to  clip the last bolt.  I have seen many people do this  including myself.  When it is done this way it is  definately put at 5.9.  If you go straight up an undercling  is needed to make a good reach to clip that last bolt.
    Dec 21, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A good route, did it awhile back. I can't justify the 10d rating but would give it 10b/c, if you are using the holds all over the left face perhaps the route is 10a, but being an arete and doing the route keeping this in mind I think the rating stands. The proper name of the route, just for bookkeeping sakes is "Sunshine Arete".

    There are a lot of loose blocks at the top, but there's a detached block on the right wall - a logical foothold if trying to move around right to the anchor for the arete - which is ready to go and extremely dangerous for anyone on the ground. I'd recommend heading straight up and belaying from the tree.    This would be OK if the bushy start and rubble-filled finish were cleaned, but it's hard to recommend it as is.

    The theory is that a broken hold has upped the grade for Mr Stiffie to 14a from 13d. There is no new line, just an altered route. BTW Mr Stiffie should be its own route as it uses the arete more than the crack as it heads right along the upper section.

    Instead of going to the break in the roof, pull the roof.  There is a good undercling and then good holds over the top... adds some fun to an easy line (pulling the roof directly is probably still only 5.7).

    The more difficult section of the climb, the roof and above, has reasonable pro opportunities. Study the route from the bottom and plan accordingly. While perhaps not a good beginner 5.6 trad lead, I rather liked the "tricky" pro-placing scenario. For that reason, the climb is a good mental test at the grade.

How about we compare the grade for a climb in one are to other climbs in the same area. (i.e., compare Gyro Captian to other climbs in Boulder Canyon).  The result of within-climbing area grade comparison will of course be that some areas will have a reputation as soft and others as sandbagged, but hopefully there will be consistentcy within the climbing area (in this case Boulder Canyon).

    This must be the hardest 10 at the cliff. Perhaps one of the easier 11's?  Moving right under the roof is difficult and getting to the jug is a pretty stiff move for 5.10. Or maybe I was totally missing something, but I did it twice and it was hard both times despite trying to find another way.  Maybe I did not find the crux head-jam.  The bolt protecting the tricky mantle above the roof is pretty crap. An old [Star-Dryven] with a rusty [Leeper]. The route runs out above the bolt too, so this requires some either element of faith, confidence, or stupidity to get far above.  It should be replaced someday and is probably not good to push your grade on. I could write a small [article] called "how to epic" on 5.10 regarding this route.  '...It all started by placing my red camalot down low, just for the heck of it. I didn't want or need gear, but the placement was [begging] to be had, so I placed it.  [Then] I got up under [the] roof, where the red would have been perfect. I tried the green- pretty crappy, so [I] shoved the yellow in. [This] resulted in an over-stuffed crack with a solid placement, although tricky and with one lobe of the camming unit in a crux finger edge... Now I'd placed the red and yellow. Climbing the roof I came out and up above the crap bolt a ways and out left to what would have been a good yellow camalot placement., but I'd placed the yellow where [the] red should have been.  So I shoved in a blue in a flare and traversed left out a bit and up to the belay, which would have been perfectly set on a Blue Camalot, but alas...  It all started with a red camalot.

    Lots of scrambling in between 2 sections that make that up. While not a total bomb, there are reasons why people bolted a lot around there but not this one.    I more or less lead/bouldered/soloed everything around there in 2001 and never thought it was worthy of mention or attention. This line does protect on a few small cams low down prior to bolt #1. Here is the question - isn't that about all the protection you need? If you can do that, the rest is a cake walk.

    There are a bunch of large loose rocks near the ledge around 4/5ths of the way up. I removed a few of the melon-size rocks that were ready to knock out a belayer, but there are still some sketchy pieces up there. Be careful and you'll be fine.    Note: Most of this route can be toproped by walking out onto the ledge referenced above. Anchor yourself to the easily accessible bolt for safety, and use the large boulder in combination with the bolt to build your toprope anchor.

    As a fledgling 7 trad and 8 sport leader, I got freaked below the 1st bolt. The #7 stopper placement looked a bit iffy. Backed off and spotted a nice little crack from the ground. Double zero C3 saved the day, I hung on that puppy to test it... beautiful! Absolute comfort cruise from there.
    May 26, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Not the greatest route. The start is the best part of the route and the pro is reasonable if you are confortable with trad climbing. I put in a small cam in a horizontal crack low down and the nut in the undercling. Both were good placements. So, as a 5.7 trad route, it's fine but unsustained.     As a sport climb, this sucks. Once you get to the first bolt, you walk past three more to the ledge. Then there is one way too low and two above where the climbing gets fun again. So, basically there are three reasonable bolts on the thing. Would it have killed them to put one bolt down low? I guess I understand not putting bolts next to gear placements, but I think it's lousy how many grid bolted climbs have a highball boulder start, as if it's some kind of ego thing. This is clearly a beginner climb, so trade one of the plentiful bolts on the 5.0 ramp for one down low and you have a safe, beginner route.

    I think this is a good beginner lead, depending upon what you lead. If one is just breaking into 5.7, probably not! The first bolt is high up, I did the aforementioned small cam in the undercling, I felt it was solid and did not worry going for the bolt.  You gotta admit, it is 5.7, no harder. The second crux is not thin really, just have to spend a minute figuring it out.  I think it's great to have a quick warmup climb before hitting other stuff on the crag!

    Only a good beginner lead if the first bolt is clipped as Tonya mentioned. This was my girlfriend's first lead (sport or trad), and she's been on Supercrack Buttress with me in IC. She follows 10a trad and didn't feel comfortable clipping the first bolt. Be advised.~Wm

    We climbed this route yesterday...after trudging through four feet of snow to get to the base.  Gosh, do I sound like my grandpa telling stories of walking to school in the old days?    Here is my two cents on this one....my hubby is a "beginner leader"....this was his second lead and he cruised it...now he is 6' tall and has been climbing for three years.  After he led it, he pulled the rope, and it fell leaving the first bolt clipped so I could lead with little/no risk of hitting the ground should I fall off doing the initial crux move.  This is my second year of leading, and I am 5'2".  I was thrilled to have the rope running through the first bolt given the ground rush potential.  I agree....there was protection had I chosen to place a piece before the bolt.  I actually found this section to be easy (of course - I had no risk)....it was the upper crux where the two bolts are close that I found to be the hardest moves...it is protected but a fall before the second bolt would result in hitting the ledge...it is a couple of dicey moves and very thin.    Beginner route....the verdict is still out....I vote "no."
    Mar 31, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I applaud the 'ground-up' style (very reasonable on this terrain) and can easily understand the qualms about this being a 'beginner route'; however, the use of clean protection at the bottom shouldn't preclude 5.7 leaders from trying this. There are two placements possible to protect the initial section, and while neither is ideal, it should be quite easy to climb back to the ground to test them if you are having any doubts about pulling past them. This is a good habit to adopt - beginner or not. (I led it w/o clipping the bolts, since the first couple also offer nut placements and the climbing is about 5.2 anyway....the last 2 bolts seem warranted though.)
    Sep 11, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The crux 5.7 protects with a single #7 stopper at about eye level. Clip a single biner to this, and then clip the bolt once you're through.  If that nut pulls out later, who cares?  The other partially cruxy section is after the ledge, but the bolts here protect you real well.  Maybe not such a great beginner route, since the start can be freaky.     I saw two guys trying this route in hiking boots and a 2-foot runner on that #7 stopper.  You can imagine how far they got.  Plus, that nut placement got stuck, and they walked around to rappel down to get it.  Ha!  Don't do this.  You really have to rappel this route from top.  Otherwise, you're in for some vertical bushwaking w/no belay.  If you really wan't to, you can set up a belay/rap at the ledge with a bolt and a #2 Camalot, or something weird like that.

    This is described as located left of "Sunset Arete"... is this the same as "Arete", which is left of the classic finger crack?    I saw some bolts here - the first one is high, and the route continues up low angle rock and a sort of a headwall. In semi-darkness it looked dicy to get to the first bolt.

    Good beginner route? Ha!  The start is the best part, but the tiny cam stuck in the undercling (I eshewed the RPs in the cracks to that point) at the 5.7 crux is a couple feet below you, and I wouldn't want to fall on it.  It was actually kind-of fun, but we were kidding each other that we were in England, on Gritstone, climbing at the crux above marginal gear.  Not a really good beginner route.

    If you are comfortable on class 3/4, you can quickly approach this climb from the left as well - 5-10 feet of climbing is all it takes.     On another note - there is a huge pile of crap right under the first bolt. We really couldn't think of a large enough animal that would be also agile enough to get to that spot.

    Great moves, but you clip one bolt before starting, then 2 more and then the anchors... the bolts are 5' apart.  So the meat of the climbing is 10-15 feet.  Great fun, but over quickly.

    The crux is protected by some awkward gear in not-so-great rock. The bolt just above the overhang can be clipped from above the crux, but frankly, I skipped it until after due to an awkward stance.  Not a great route. As if to punctuate the questionable nature of some of the rock on this climb, a hold broke off just above the crux while I was downclimbing it from the top. This might have been one of the options for a clipping hold.

    Dangerous for a 5.9 leader, easy to deck on the sharp ledge if you blow the crux moves getting past the first bolt. Also it's solid 5.10 if you try to go straight to the second bolt instead of staying right (and even staying right is very tough 5.9). I wouldn't be surprised if a hold or two broke off at some point. Short leaders may need an extendo draw to clip the first bolt.

    Height or arm-length dependent. A reach followed by a scrunch problem. You have to make a semi-hard move to clip the first bolt, so in reality, you might as well be bouldering the start.

    Definitely bring the stick clip for this one unless you're a solid 5.11 leader.  The crux sequence requires some precise body position while the pump meter is ticking.

    The first move of this climb is interesting but the rest not too exciting.  If you had a pad you could do this as a boulder problem, since the crux isn't that high.  The first move is burly, requiring a powerful powerful shoulder to push off the left flake to get the left-facing incut with the right hand.  (I don't recommend trying the intermediates.)  Being taller helps.  From here you can lock off and clip.  Then you reach up (I crossed over with the left) to the right to a big jug and the climb is done.

    This is a fun little pitch. I found a perfect #10 stopper placement in a finger slot that protects the moves up to the bolt. You could plug an Alien in here, but then there would be no room for your fingers, and the stopper is bomber. There was also what looked like a good medium cam placement just above the lower shelf, although I had no cams with me.    Not to start a shit storm, but I am inclined to say that this would have made a better sport route. It is basically a face climb, and the placements are definitely not in a crack, per se. I just don't see the point of carrying a rack to do twenty-five feet of moderate mixed climbing. Just my opinion.

    A fun bouldering traverse along the flake to get to the crack where you can place your first pro (#2 Camalot).

    If you start sitting way down and left, there is a cool, gaston boulder problem to link into the original start of BFK. (Bring a pad to protect this part.) Not perfect rock, but really cool athletic movement. Probably adds a letter/or V-grade to the route. One of my favorite "mini" routes in B-Canyon. With a lot of pads and fresh knees, it would be pretty reasonable to just boulder this route out.
    Apr 13, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Some additional beta for getting with Brenda from Kansas: You can pre-clip the first bolt leaning over from a rock; use a locker on this and a short draw on the second. Because the wall's so steep, you'll skid backward a little if you fall below the first bolt, so having a crashpad down there to cush out your landing might help; we used packs and jackets.    The starting hold is the lowest, four-foot-long horizontal rail down in the pit at about chest height. Start any higher and you're cheating on Brenda...from Kansas.    On the upper part (Obscurity Risk) you can back up each angle with an RP near it, as well as a bomber yellow (No. 2) Master Cam in the horizontal from which you clip the second pin. The angles stick out quite a bit, so it's good to back them up and/or tie them off. This upper part is spooky 5.11.    BONUS tip from Brenda: Once you're on the ledge, have your belayer huck up the gear and draws for the upper bit, so you don't need to lug them with you on the V-Brenda bouldering crux.

    I cleaned the route hard on lap #1 and then went for lap #2. It improved a lot with cleaning- as well, some good footholds came up from under lichen and dirt on the second crux, stepping right into the lower angle crack.    The start is still hard and has a bad landing. As well, it is strenuous to place gear there. I elected to continue climbing higher and place below me after getting the bomber flake and side-pull on it.  Since the rock below is pointed and sloping, and far enough to hurt a climber, I suggest approaching this route with caution.    Difficulty?    Bottom moves: 5.11-, PG13.   Rest of the route 5.10-, good gear.

    Sweet little route, 2nd bolt tough to clip.
    Jun 2, 2013

    I tore off a chunk of rock just above and left of the second bolt while climbing today. I was just happy it did not hit my belayer. This was from a stance just after the 2nd clip (which would be from the incut below). The remaining rock nearby is solid. Fun enough- but the upper slab still needs some cleaning.

    10a if climbed up from straight below at the start. If coming in from the left, easier- perhaps 5.9. This is a good climb with good rock and good moves, teh best at this small cliff, but it is pretty hard to call a 50-foot line a 'classic' when climbs like Country Club Crack and Athlete's Feet are within view from the anchors.

    A little scary at the start. I climbed up and hung off the first fixed nut to back it up, then lowered and fired from the start with the fixed nut and back-up nut already clipped.  No decking potential that way. Cool route overall- steep and funky with a back-up available next to almost every fixed piece.

    I thought that the moves to the shelf after the first bolt were the crux. I wish I'd had a dust-mask, goggles and alcohol up there- so I could brush the guano off of the crux holds without contracting some odd infection or disease. Save for that it's a good climb.  I didn't find the feet out and right at the second roof and was goofing off- and found that a good jam and a double toe-hook up and over the roof was bomber. The climb goes up-side-down there with good heels and toes. Fun way to try it anyway and skips the tenuous moves.

    On my first lap I ran the crux, sight unseen similarly to the way the pictures show.  Second time I found a way to do it without going right of the main feature which was actually a nicer line and more technique, but less gropey.  This route might not be so hard, but it would be hard to onsight, so I'd give it 11c.  Also, it might get another star someday if it really cleans up, but meanwhile it's a bit dirty.

    I aid soloed this a while back and almost seriously hurt myself using RPs at the start. Later, I returned and used Leeper cam hooks with much better results. Doing a couple free moves at the top is much easier than goofing with hooks-IMHO.

    This route goes free at about 11a, plus or minus, depending on how you attack the 3 cruxes.  The pro at the first crux is decent (with an attentive belayer), so-so at the second crux, and good at the third.  Just over the ledge at the top is an old button head bolt, evidence that this route was done long ago.  Really good route with diverse, technical climbing.

    What's the crack right above the boulder at the base? Is that "tricky nailup"?    I heard of a good practice C3 line on Practice rock (go figure) so I went looking and soloed that one, lots of cam hooks up high (or RPs I was too pansy to commit to). Turns out I wasn't on this route. I kinda followed the route labeled 1 (traverse left then right) then about halfway up I stopped traversing and went straight up those 2 thin cracks right below the huge block on top. Anyone know what I climbed, cause it sure was fun?

    I want to thank whoever removed the #1 copperhead from the start of this route. At the time it seemed like the most novel idea but in retrospect, its existence is not warranted by any need. Instead, I would now advocate maybe using a micro cam-hook, or some offset brass. Another part of the climb even goes free with decent gear. Use your own judgement and climb as clean as possible, I know that I will after this.

    Old timer again, I must be getting senile.  The seam of tricky nailup is the one that goes all the way to the ground (2 over from the route marked 1) so this may not be the same climb that DZ is talking about.  A random bit of history however.
    May 17, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Thought that you might want to hear from an "old timer." This thin seam was listed way back in a 1972 (?) guide book by Pat Ament for the Boulder area that had the title "5.10" (a little red book).  It was rated A3 (old school) and was considered a practice nailup.  The name was "tricky nailup" as I recall.  I also solo aided it about 2-3 years ago and I don't think that you could zipper to the ground (but then I used a BD Pecker in the seam - which was actually hard to get out).  HB offsets and tiny TCUs worked great at the pods in the seam (which by the way are old pin scars).

    I just recently solo-lead this climb again and the pink tricam comment is total bull. You might need two #5's but one will definitely be half-way out(bring along the Smirnoff). A blue TCU can help at the crux along with possibly a #3 stopper equalized with something else.  I flailed around for a hook placement.  Anyway, only double on the #4s needed, and the crux is just totally fun. Just be sure to duct-tape the sling around the horn real well.  Otherwise, you're in for a long fall...

    I sincerely apologize for posting this as a first ascent. At the time, there were three reasons suggesting that this real was an unclimbed route. 1: I asked employees at Neptune's and Mountain Sports as well as Roger Briggs about this route. All told me that they didn't know of this aid line.  2: I looked on the internet and in the Neptune's New Routes Book, there was absolutely no mention of it there either.  3: When I climbed it, the cracks were absolutely chalk-less and filled with dirt/grit, forcing me to clean thoroughly before piece placement, which left me to believe that the route was previously unclimbed.    Once again, I am very sorry for saying this is a first ascent.  The name and rating of the route are by no means official and probably wrong.  However, since my climb was not an FA, that just goes to show how cool of a route this is.  Also, if you have indeed climbed this route before, send me an e-mail, iradj@mho.net.

    Warning! The roof is made up of three or four detached blocks which look ready to let loose. Even avoiding them by pulling on the left side requires pulling on a large block which is resting on a sloping ledge. If these blocks came off, they could potentially reach the road. This route should probably be avoided. You can go right at the roof to climb "thin crack" instead although that requires some tricky gear to protect the crux.

    Fun climb. I thought the lower part was the hardest. Probably easier if you use the left bulge, but that is "off limits". The roof was pretty easy and the crack above easier than the start. Still felt like 5.9 to me or maybe 5.9+. Probably easier for climbers with longer arms.

    Though I don't believe in "+" ratings for 7s, Chan has it right; this route, really, is a breeze--especially for those with monkey arms (though my shorter partner crushed it anyway on lead). I call this down an "8," though, against the grain, I also upgraded the 10a on the right to 10b.
    Apr 1, 2010

    Good gear makes this route a breeze.  Down low, a couple of good wires and maybe a TCU in a pin scar.  A number 3 camalot above and right of the overhang is bomber and a big stopper behind the expanding flake will sew it up well.  Be careful not to set the stopper to deep behind the flake, you might not get it back.  Feels no harder than some of the older routes in the 7+ range in BoCan (Owl, Cozyhang, Empor).

    Feb 8, 2015

    Forget the "wide" gear.     Start with a yellow Alien, pump up to a #3 Camalot in a fat slot, then stuff a #4 up there JUST BEFORE the flake gets superwide, then walk out that lieback around the corner, baby. It's pumptastic, but the friction-friendly feet are better than they look from the ground. And it's a hell'ave-a trip wondering out that far up and left above good gear. Great for head strength. Bring some finger cams for the 5.8 scrambling at the top out.    As for me, I held and had to lower. Needed to psyche up hard before I could re-climb and send.    And? This is pretty F'in pumpy for 10a. I'm usually one to grade DOWN (see "Left Crack), but this one I call it a solid 10b, even though the magic is short lived.    Q: Anyone know why--in Boulder Canyon, of all places--there aren't anchors above these lines? The tree pendulum anchor is kinda nasty....

    We've been rating this 5.10 for a long, long time, and after untold laps on all of the routes on Practice Rock  think "Lieback" is definitely is harder than the route you call "Thin Crack" which is listed as 9+. Also,  what is listed here as "Left Crack" is more like 5.8 than 5.9.

    It's a good one, for some reason we found this easier than the 10b flake next-door.   It took fiddling with gear at the crux would love to get back and lead it clean.  Here's what I remember placing (it was like 3 hours ago, but short term memory...  you know how it goes):    -#2 BD to keep you off the deck at the first wide part.   - Something thin past that, maybe a blue Metolius or similar (if needed, it's not hard to the jug), then to the "jug" before it zags left,   -you can place a 0.75 if you reach far up, this one held a whipper for my friend.    - up past that a 0 TCU in a pinscar at the crux seemed quite solid but wouldn't hold much more than a 3-4 footer reliably,  - you can then place a good small nut.   I put in a #8 Metolius Astronut, but a #1 nut would fit in there nicely, then run it out to the rusty pin.  -  clip the pin, get to a nice rest and throw in a solid red Metolius (0.5?) cam in a big pinscar on your left and make the exit moves out right.       Anyone ever taken the line completely left instead of zagging back right?           That's an embarassing amount of spray for me, at least it'll help me remember what to place for next time.

    As a variation, if one avoids the finger lock above and to the left of the mini-overhand and instead directly tackles the mini-overhand from below (reaching up and to the climber's right for a good flake), this route can be significantly harder (perhaps middle 10s).

    This is a surprisingly good route, and I am almost tempted to give it three stars, except that it is a bit short. The climbing, on positive edges and sidepulls, is interesting all the way to the anchors. I didn't find the lunge mentioned above. On the contrary, I found good holds within reach the entire way.     Good job, Bob and Greg.    Hey, Greg. Screw the wheelchair access. I enjoyed bushwacking away from the crowds for a change. I liked it so much that I'm going back, tomorrow, to do the 5.12.

    After the second bolt, there is a stretch of blank face.  This is the crux.  The move, as I did it, is a lunge/deadpoint to a good left hand.  The hands and feet for the move are good but it is committing.  This move is probably somewhat height-dependent.

    I went up to do this route, today, and broke the crux handhold off. It was a good edge, and it is now a bad sloper. The route felt like 12- with it, but it is solid 5.12 without it. I was up there with Matt Samet, and he redpointed it without the hold. He said it is probably 12b/c now. The third clip is harder.    Be careful standing on the detached blocks at the first bolt. A basketball-size chunk broke off, when I stepped on it, and almost took out my belayer. Make sure that the belayer and rope pile are back far enough away from the wall in case the rest of this huge block goes. It is probably a hundred pounds, and could easily kill someone. It is not a matter of if but when.    Otherwise, this is an okay route.

    Was on this today. Pulled off a couple pieced of dangerous choss that must have loosened up over the winter because I don't remember them last summer. I don't think they effect the grade unless you climb it substantially differently than I do. Adds a foot after the crux, but there's another good foot there anyway.    Still feel like 10c is a good grade. It's essentially a V3 boulder problem that's 15 feet off the ground and surrounded by 5.7ish stuff. Maybe unaesthetic overall but I really dig the crux move - sequencey and powerful.

    Yeah. The thing is, it's a really short problem. After the pullup to the flake, the rest of the climb is 5.7. The two or three crux moves are solid 5.11 (IMHO), but given how short it is, I think 10c isn't a bad rating.

    You're right, Big Wave, actually the rating I posted is what it was before I watched (in horror) some Frenchie with a hammer pull loose a piece of the old handhold because he thought it would fall loose under his weight.

    Hey Rick, I saw you guys on this the other day when I was coming down from the Second Buttress.  The two bolts mentioned are there, they are about 5ft down and to the right of the poorly placed bolt you speak of, but it's a little hairy accessing them; I think the bolt up higher is meant for safely accessing the two-bolt anchor.  In any case, they don't provide a good position for the route either.    On another note, anybody know of the name and grade of the straight up route with a chalk tick on it?  Seemed 5.12 to me....
    Oct 26, 2013

    Fun route that makes you look for holds a little.  Top roped it, so I wasn't looking for gear placement.  I'd say the first half would be easy to protect and the second half not as easy especially the last moves.  Easy to start with a few mantle moves, but it's mostly cracks.  The last few moves are a bit chossy and vertical, and I'd say this is the crux.  Luckily, the BC path was still closed due to the flood.  You belay from almost middle of the path where there is typically a lot of traffic, so expect gawkers.  There is one very short steep section section on the hike up to the anchors to set a top rope, but you don't necessarily need to rappel back down it.  I only found one bolt but apparently, as stated below, there are 2 somewhere down there but not in position for this route.  I didn't see them on the way up either.  I used a 30ft sling to back up the single bolt and get the master point over the edge.
    Oct 25, 2013

    I did a couple laps of this with a friend on a freakishly warm day in the middle of December. We setup a top-rope using the bolts. After the dihedral, there is a traverse right on the "bridge" which feels a little exposed even on a top-rope. After that, we finished the route up the nose to the bolts. Just before the end, you can traverse a little left to some nice granite for a finish that requires some reachy moves to slopers - it's little variations like this which have me giving the route a 5.8-. On the second lap, I tried to climb straight up from the top of the dihedral - this redder rock is pretty crumbly and dirty and I slipped off a few moves in - I don't recommend this variation. Also, beware of swinging around on the top-rope. In hind-sight, I might have used a directional.

    Interesting, but a little contrived and grungy with a lot of groveling.  The holds on this route are also a big contrast from the routes elsewhere on the rock.       As for finding the route, start at the awkward bulge about 10' left of a huge iron eye-bolt at ground level.  Moving straight up from the eye-bolt gets you to a much lower pair of cold shuts on what looks like an easier line.

    I think this is way more appropriate as a boulder problem than the gill crack.  The gill crack is more fun on a rope if you finish on black crack.  This is a really cool roof crack however you decide to play on it but I think a bouldering pad is all you need.

    Very fun.  My vote would be solid 5.12 compared to Gill Crack and Thunderdome as far as area grades are concerned.  If Gill Crack is an eleven, I need to go to corner. This area get blazing afternoon sun.  Curious how people do it.  I stayed in the right hand crack - straight in the whole time.

    I found the crux to be right above the lip of the overhang, where the crack opens up. I mostly used face holds at this point, making full use of the arete on the right. TR rope solo was my choice for pro, but it seems like placing pro would be strenuous to say the least.

    For anyone thinking of bouldering this route, it is a clean fall from and above the roof.  You should miss the slab below the roof, as well as the big rock by the parking area.  I bouldered this route yesterday with a couple of friends and hit the pad cleanly everytime, even slipping off on the top out when I was above the entire crack when my feet greased.  Also, as for the route being soft, I'm not sure that I agree.  I felt that this route was harder than the Gill Crack, which I'm willing to argue is 5.11+, making this route at least 5.12a.  Both cracks made for awsome boulder problems though.  Leading them seemed kind of lame for how short they both are, but the moves are great!

    The route is pretty good for its length. To give it 2 stars means that that 20' of climbing is truly good climbing, and would be 3-star if it were long enough to be a route. It would be a great boulder problem, right? 3 stars then? So, I'll give it 2 as a route.     As for difficulty, there are plenty of V9s that are no taller and that's what, 5.13? So anyway, I don't think that the height changes the difficulty.    That said, I don't know if the route is 5.12a or not, but I doubt harder.  My first go with one busted-up ankle (foot in a splint) I got over the roof and jammed into the hand-crack. Fully dangling off of said jam, I was able to campus above. At the time, not knowing what the route was suggested to be, I had guessed possibly 11c or 11d. 12a is fine, too.    The real difficulty is in ignoring the pain of the finger-wrecking locks. 2 days later, my arthritic knuckles are still aching.

    Jun 30, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    In my experience, the crack only accepts small (up to .75 cams) and stoppers are pretty hard to work in there. Also, if you want an interesting bouldering (or TR) problem, climb the broken crap just right of the crack (it's no harder than 5.8, if that). If you want to set up a TR, there is really only one solid way, and that is to hike up the loose slope to the top of Rock Island and sling a big horn. Then hike down or "rappel" to a ledge just above and right of the crack to belay.     You can also put in some nuts or TCUs at this ledge, but I think the placements aren't exactly top-rope worthy.

    I love this area....it is great when the kids fall asleep in the car and I can pull over almost right under Candelaria's Crack and do some easy but fun bouldering for 30 minutes.  There is a great hand crack/lie back corner down the wall about halfway, there's an old piton protecting the upper moves (in case you want to lead it....great beginner lead but short, 25 feet topout).  It is maybe 5.6 but great to just work on jams eliminating feet (only in crack) and toping out and down climbing it.....I like climbing it in the rain for fun. There is another traversing lieback crack that joins another sweet handcrack....an easy arete, easy slabs, some huge roofs (if your strong and like those scary high balls), a couple easier finger cracks just to the right of Candelarias. Most of the bouldering here is pretty easy with some hard and scary (the roofs, Candelaria's Crack) ones also.....very close to town and fun for killing 30 minutes while the kids are napping.

    I thought this was an interesting climb.  There is still some lichen, but otherwise the route seems pretty clean.  There are a lot of scars where rock has flaked off, but hopefully the remaining holds are stable.  There is a scar right between the last two bolts, making me wonder if there was a crimper there at one time.  The crux here seemed pretty thin.  I went up to the right to reach a knob, but there was nothing for my feet except licheny smears while I made the last clip.  It's definitely easier than 5.12 though.

    This is a great little route! Fun boulder problem with varied holds and movement into a stellar arete / flared crack feature. Honestly, I was surprised - I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Not sure on the grade, I'm horrible at rating boulder problems and this is by all means just a 8 move boulder. My guess would be that it's more 13d as Peter originally proposed. Who knows. More people should climb this!

    Glad to see that Matt climbed this route.  It is a great route that rarely gets done.  I have not returned to repeat this technical vertical face now for 19 years. I established this route with Bob D'Antonio on February 3, 1995 &amp; then repeated it a few days (redpointing it twice).  Ian Spencer Greene redpointed it on the day I repeated it, being the second person to redpoint the route.   Since then, I have seen almost no one on this climb.

    This is a very odd comment by Taylor Roy. I established the route on March 9, 1995. I redpointed it twice that month. I also cleaned a lot of lichen. It is hard to believe you could spend a hour more, but I guess it is possible. I also don't remember leaving a loose block below the anchor. I am curious now if the block is really loose or just a hollow flake. Perhaps it is too big to want to trundle. As for placing gear, it didn't seem necessary if you can climb this route.   I originally tried to establish this route via its direct start, Agony Of The People, but was unsuccessful. So I finally bolted the indirect start that the line takes. The route is quite sustained, but I thought the crux was around 4th &amp; 5th bolts using the edge of the vertical seam on the right side of the arête to lieback on while palming with my left hand &amp; pasting my left foot flat on the left side. Pillar climbing technique used on buildings. A memorable route that I have not revisited in 20 years.

    Unfortunately doesn't climb as nice as it looks.  Easy start, hard to avoid the dihedral on the right, which makes you feel kind of dirty.  Good crux, but the sharp pinky lock with marginal feet is a little tense.  As with a lot of GH routes, the bolt placement above the crux is ridiculously reachy.  Actually it isn't even reachy - you have to leave a really good stance for some tweaky moves and a screwed up clip. This really detracted from the route in my opinion.    The climbing above is unclear.  I moved left to the arete, which seemed the most natural thing to do but couldn't figure out how to clip the last bolt and had to skip it. Not sure if you are supposed to go into the licheny flared crack on the right(?).    I almost gave this route a bomb, but the crux was pretty cool.

    My brother and I flailed on this a couple of years ago. Yesterday I TR'd this on self belay after doing Security Risk. Got it, but it was very desperate this time. Total lunge at the crux for a big sidepull and then pumpy with not much feet to the anchors. Much harder than the other 11a's at Security Risk. There are lots of scars in the crux area from broken flakes and crystals, but those scars were there 2 years ago, so I'm not saying it's gotten harder recently. You could, but few would, continue trad from the anchor to the top at 5.8 or so.

    The bottom of the route looks grungy, but I'd say the rock is solid and takes pretty good gear.  I used Aliens at the bottom and bomber large cams at the top and got in a couple of nuts.

This route and Security Risk combine for a nice morning of trad, though one shouldn't leave without getting on at least one of the stellar sport routes.

    Pretty fun if you can get through the loose stuff at the bottom.  Big stems avoid most of the rotten rock....  Then a nice crack and better rock all the way to the anchor.  Easy for old school 8+ but hard for a bolted 10.  I guess the consensus is 5.9....

    I submit that *many* multi-pitch routes are not done today following the exact line of the first ascent.

    Great climb. One of the best of the trad climbs in the Boulder Canyon area (Left Side - WWW, Where Eagles Dare - Blob Rock, Cosmosis - Bell Buttress, and Security Risk). The 10d start is protectable for any competent trad climber and should not be avoided unless 5.9 is your limit. I had gear above my head the entire way. There's even a fixed nut directly below the crux. Great stemming options throughout (no hands rest below the crux, though strenuous on the legs).
    Nov 11, 2009

    Terrific route, which is the namesake of the two Security Risk formations.  It seems odd to grade the route according to the easier and less interesting variations and to describe the variations as the route.  The route starts on the 10+ corner. It is not 5.9.  IMO the route should be listed and graded as originally climbed, with the easier variations being noted as options.   Good gear is available, but strenuous to place on the original first pitch The route gets another star if you run both pitches together, which is quite straightforward to do without rope drag.
    Nov 24, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    One of the best cracks in BoCan IMHO.  Get pro in on the 10d start early as it is hard to place through the crux section and you are right above the deck.  Awesome varied crack on the second pitch.  No gimme for a 5.9 leader.  You might want a double set if cams on this one to sew it up or bring a few hexes.  A #4 can be placed, but not required.  It varies a lot though so a single set of nuts, cams will suffice if confident on 5.9 crack.
    Nov 9, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Why would you skip the true first pitch at 10d?  Yeah the gear is a little strange, but you get two bomber nuts to begin with and two small cams before the crux move.  The first pitch is tough and well worth climbing.    However, it is tough to do as one long pitch this way due to drag.
    Oct 21, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There is a nice variety of techniques to apply on this route - jamming, stemming, and thin balancey moves.  The 5.10a variation on P1 is great, though I thought the pro was lacking near the upper section.  Managed to place a purple TCU in the little hand-sized flake at the crux, but I wouldn't want to fall onto that piece.
    Oct 7, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The original start is great and I disagree with the author on avoiding it. It protects well with smaller cams and make the the whole climb constantly challenging. Climb the left-facing dihedral to the left of the 5.7 start. This makes the first pitch 10d.
    Sep 9, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Climbed this for the third time recently, I have now done all 3 start variations.  The 10a start is accurately described by Ivan.  The upper pitch is shorter than I remembered, maybe only 120' or so.  The jams also seemed less bomber (flared) than I remembered, and it helps to have big hands on this pitch.  The crux on this pitch seemed to me at the small 1' overhang (between the cracks).  This pitch will uncover any flaws in your crack climbing and stemming technique!
    Jul 12, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Damn, what a fine crack this is.  For me, the balancy 5.7 section off the deck was the scariest, it's a wee dirty and funky.  Once above the ledge the stemming is fabulous then the jamming goes on for a longish time.  I was glad I had 2 #1 Camalots, and a #3.5.  Several rests provide opportunity to de-pump your left arm.
    May 13, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    10a start: This is the shallow left facing corner and thin crack right of the regular start and just right of the 5.7 variation. The Rolofson guide calls this 10a, and that's about right. The start, up to a ledge, is harder than it looks. The step right at a ceiling is a little exciting, with gear up high and left, and about 5.9. You probably don't want to combine this start with the second pitch due to rope drag over the ceiling. You would need a really long sling to prevent drag, and that would make the step right a little too exciting.
    Jan 6, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I combined the first and second pitch easily with a 60m rope, for a very enjoyable long pitch.  I stayed near the 5.7 start, but actually went slightly right of the 5.7 section, climbing through the bulge via the 5.9-ish squeeze slot.  Granted it doesn't sound very appealling, but it was a short section, well protected with a standard rack, and quite fun.  Combining the pitches is highly recommended, but the average 5.8/5.9 leader will want to double up in the 1-3 Camalot sizes to do it.

    We thought this route kind of sucked.  Awkward first pitch but pretty well protected.  My partner had a little bit of trouble clipping the bolt before the crux but managed.    Second pitch completely blows.  Wanders all over the place trying to find the hardest climbing.  Bolts are poorly located resulting in biners loading over edges, rope running over edges, etc.  The anchor is kind of a botched job as well as it isn't well equalized.    Not really worth doing.

    The first pitch is indeed cryptic and on the first attempt I was perplexed.  Aided by beta, the second attempt went much better.  The second pitch is pretty good but is still somewhat dirty, unless I was way off-route.  I'm pretty certain you can rappel from the 2nd-pitch anchors with a 60m rope.

    If you don't do the 2nd pitch, then you're missing out.  The first pitch, in of itself, is probably not two-star quality.  I thought the better climbing was on the 2nd pitch.  The position is also excellent, though there is a bit of looseness.  Climbing all the way to the top from the anchors at the top of pitch 1 is about 90 feet of climbing and one 60m rope easily gets you back down to that anchor.
    Sep 19, 2003

    I also believe that 11b is on par with other sport routes in Boulder Canyon.  The climbing is not powerful, but good use of your feet is key.
    Jan 9, 2003

    The first pitch is a little ugly compared to the other routes nearby. The upper pitches look good, but I didn't do them. I'll be back for those pitches.    The first pitch seemed easier than two 11a's I did the same day, Led Astray and Cold Shot. One hard move between good stances. If it were trad, I'd call the first pitch 10b/c. I say that, because I more often than not cannot onsight 10c trad clean (I know that's redundant) yet I onsighted this quite easily. The rating of this may be consistent with modern sport climbing standards, but I can't say, being new to sport climbing after 30+ years trad.
    Jan 6, 2003

    I did all 3 pitches and liked the whole route. It is aptly named, as the crux is complex but not so physically hard. I didn't high-step either. The first pitch was 5.11, and the second was 5.10. The third felt like 5.10 as well, but maybe that was the pump factor. I lead the first two pitches as one for sure, and if I remember correctly, I lead the entire thing as a single pitch on a 70m rope. Sorry, but I don't recall how much rope was left at the end. I did skip some clips and use some 2' long slings along the way to avoid drag. We walked off of the top.

    Not sure who replaced these, but the anchor bolts are now fresh ASCA hardware.  Support them and your local re-bolting efforts (the BCC) if you value safe hardware.    The top 2 bolts prior to the anchor still need to be replaced.    P.S. very good hand-jam at the roof-crux-flake.

    This is a wonderful route.  The only problem it has is one of consistency--most of the route, save the roof at the very end, is good 5.10, and the roof itself is 5.11.  There is one confusing point about halfway up below a small roof.  There appears to be a blank face leading to a small roof with no holds and a huge runout to the next bolt.  There is actually a bolt obscured by the small roof.Get your feet high, stand up with the aid of a small 2-finger sidepull used for balance, and then reach for the big hidden crack underneath the small roof and make the clip.  The roof at the top is the star of the route.  When approaching the roof, you have to go left, clip the bolt in the middle of the roof, and then work your way right and undercling the huge flake.  Then you can clip the bolt at the edge of the roof.  The next moves are super-burly.You have to get your feet really high and you are really exposed (although there is no dangerous fall potential).  Work your hands up and move to the right to get a big hueco and another big hold over the roof.  Then, with the left foot really high, haul your way over the top.  Stellar.

    Great route! I'm surprised it doesn't get climbed more. We only had a 55m rope and had plenty left. Maybe a new anchor was put in lower on the pitch?     The "OW" start is not bad, and much more logical to stem around given all the feet. Single new #5 is plenty on the big gear.

    You can get by with a single #5 C4, if you don't mind bumping up the cam for 25ft from good stances. The crack is mostly #5 sized, so an extra #5 or Big bro could be used instead of the #6.

    I highly recommend this route.  I don't know about soft for 10d, but who knows? 10+ seems about right.    I wouldn't call the start "burly offwidthing".  It felt about 5.9 to me.  Could be a little harder if you had really small hands; I was able to get a few good fist jams along the way.    For newer BD sizes (C4s), I used one each of 4, 5, and 6.  This is sufficient to be well protected for the start without sewing it up.  There may be other gear there.  I had the big stuff so I wasn't looking. I'd take doubles in the 0.5 to 0.75 Camalot range.    This climb doesn't have any bad sections.

    Steve, We considered continuing up and right (but without consulting a guidebook), but it looked easy and there were bolts that are, apparently, a continuation of Plan B.

    I believe the "serious" rating in the guidebook pertains to the 10d s last pitch that comes after the route description by Adam above.  I don't think it gets done very often... it looks fairly lichenous and perhaps a bit chossy, as well as run out! And it's also very short, 30 or 40 feet?
    Apr 19, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I've wanted to do this route since I first saw it about 2 years ago, but Rossiter's 10dS rating scared me away. Adam's posting of this climb reinspired me. Turns out you can get as much gear as you want, and it may be soft for 10d.    You'll want a 4.5 and 5 Camalot for the wide crack. I placed a couple more big cams since we carried our nuclear arsenal up the hill, not knowing what we'd be up against. We all stemmed the wide start, and it was fun and interesting--not at all a grovel. Above the wide crack is an airy moderate overhanging corner. If you don't have double in hand-sized cams (#2 Camalot), you'll want to move your one cam that fits up at least once. You could belay (or bivvy) on the lie-down ledge, but it's better to keep going so that you'll have more rope out for the hard part.    The crux shallow right facing right leaning corner is made reasonable by the occasionaly positive foothold. I placed 7 pieces in this corner from a #3 Camalot at the very bottom to a 1/4" nut at the last move. The other pieces were in the red Alien to #.75 Camalot size. No micro cams, although you might get one at the last move. The crux for me was, as Adam implies, the last move over the overhang, due to accumulated pump and placing the last piece rather than to technical difficulties. Both my partners, Luke and Chuck, avoided this by stepping left onto the face directly below the anchor bolts.    Overall, the start was better than I expected, and the upper corner was easier and much shorter and safer than I expected.

However, along with Archangel, I am glad that this route is bolted. There are very few natural gear placements, and not many of them are very good. This would easily be R/X rated without freshly placed heads. In contrast, there are many routes in the canyon that would be far more enjoyable and still reasonably protected without many of the existing bolts.

    Pretty sustained climbing to a little rooflet boulder problem.  This route, along with its neighbor, Plan B, made this little crag one of my favorite sport climbing areas in the Front Range.  Can't wait to get on the rest of the .12s at this wall!

    Thank you, Randy, for your historical account of Hot Flyer &amp; complimentary remarks of my retrobolting the climb. There are a few things I would like to clarify. I was belaying Andy Parkin in 1982 when he took the 50-60 foot fall. He fell once at the roof on two fixed copperheads &amp; they held. On his next try, he downclimbed rather than fall &amp; grabbed the heads. His outward pull unseated them. Had the heads pulled in a fall from the roof, he would have possibly decked. As he fell, poor RPs &amp; a #1 Friend zippered. A good nut he placed (above where the 5th bolt is now) caught him. There was a fixed pin a few inches lower. He landed out from the wall, left &amp; slightly above the ledge where you now clip the high 1st bolt. He was unharmed, but that ended the day. A day that began by Andy onsighting Enemy Of The People (.12b).   As for retrobolting the route. It was actually Randy Leavitt, who first suggested it to me around Thanksgiving 1993. Henry Lester &amp; I climbed with Randy on our visit to the Virgin River Gorge. Thank you Randy. I retrobolted it in July 1994. I climb the route about twice a year. It is one of best 5.12a sport routes in the canyon.   As for the 9th bolt at the roof, the rope biner on the quickdraw hangs below the lip. I do use a medium length quickdraw. It's a clean fall, &amp; the rope doesn't touch the rock. There are two ways to go at the lip. Straight up (a bit harder &amp; less obvious) or left over to The Juice &amp; then back right. I have only fallen once going this indirect way. It was very exciting.

    Wow, 22 comments and only 3 of them relate to the beta of the route...you have to admit, that kinda sucks.  My two cents, if you don't like the bolts...don't use them!!!  Now let's get to the nitty gritty.  This is a fun route, but if you are just breaking into 12s, it may get into your head as there aren't many "clean" falls.  Climb this in the shade and at cool temps to help the redpoint attempt.  The going is pretty easy through the first few bolts.  A temperature-dependent crux awaits halfway up, and the last roof my deceive some.  Stay cool, calm, and collected, and this climb holds excellent onsight potential with decent rest opportunities.

    I just recently stumbled onto this thread about Hot Flyer. I am glad everyone has enjoyed the route, and that brings me happiness.     Before the first ascent, I rapped from the top to see if there was actually a line there. Dan Hare was kind enough to show me this crag, and I had already been to the top. On rappel, I could see there was enough protection, except for the roof. While hanging on the rope, I decided to place the fixed copperheads below the roof. My background was that bolts were to be avoided, so the copperheads seemed justified. I did not try the climb or rehearse it on top rope. My rappel was merely to establish that there was a line there worth risking my ass for. I came back with a double rope belay (and two belayers). I believe Harrison Decker and Dan Hare were with me. I led the route, probably without falls (because I don't remember any). I thought it was scary but reasonable. On a subsequent trip, Harrison made the second lead, and I photographed him. I recall, he did fall once above the roof (heads held) but got it clean on his second go.    There are a lot of well thought out comments from the folks who post here. I know several of you and have tremendous respect for you (Bob and Chris).     That era was a time in Boulder when a lot of talented climbers were putting up routes that had been previously overlooked in the Golden Years of Boulder climbing development. Skip Guerin was the most talented and boldest of the lot. Alec Sharp, Jeff Achey, Harrison Decker, and Bob Horan were also very motivated and talented. Of course, there were Jim Collins and Roger Briggs, who were still active. Anyway, I was proud of Hot Flyer, even though my rappel inspection and copperheads were not perfect style. The comment one of you guys made about fixed copperheads being good for the FA and not for later parties is true, unless the copperheads are beat into the shape of a stopper and wedged into place. That was not the case here. The heads were not that good, even for me.    Maybe a year or two later, a top Brit climber, Andy Parkin, tried Hot Flyer. I was told he fell above the heads and almost decked when the heads blew (that might be a 60 foot fall). So he almost died.    Years later, Mark Rolofson called me and asked if he could retrobolt Hot Flyer. I remembered Andy Parkin. Who would rap back in to replace the fixed heads? Should a bolt go there instead? In this case, Hot Flyer was a perfect candidate for retrobolting. In fact, I thought it would be selfish of me to say no to Mark.    Rolofson was opening the fantastic route for everyone to enjoy. I tell people if they want the thrill, do Limits Of Power, which is safer than Hot Flyer ever was.    The lesson I learned is that every scary route doesn't have to stay that way. On the other hand, I would not want to see all scary, classic routes bolted (like Jules Verne). I think it shows a reasonable compromise by the FA team to let some of them be bolted. Bottom line is that many more people have enjoyed this awesome route.    I hope to return soon to climb this route again, but clipping the bolts (jeez, like the 30 year anniversary or something). I haven't done Hot Flyer since that FA. I assume Rolofson did a good job on the bolts, because he is probably good at that craft. Thanks, Mark and thanks to all of you who commented on this route.    - Randy Leavitt

    Best to traverse in from the right to avoid the choss below the first bolt.  However I always go through the choss for some reason?  Maybe I should climb in Glenwood.    Excellent route.  Glad it is bolted.  Doesn't let up until the chains.

    I agree that the bolt protecting the crux at the lip of the roof is not in the best place. The bolt is placed such that the carabiner on the rope end of a short quickdraw rests against the lip of the roof. There's pretty big whipper potential here, especially once you commit to the insecure moves on the slab, and big falls could cross load the biner, open the gate, etc... if you use a short draw. Use a long (more than 6 inch) quickdraw here.    This route's kind of a sandbag at 11+, compared to similarly graded routes in the Canyon.

    So when you say that only the FA-ist can remove bolts, you give permission for anyone else to place them, in effect... you see, if I go place them, they get to stay until the FA party returns under your rule. So when Fred Becky dies, can someone rebolt everything he ever did? Some day Chouinard, Robbins, Ament, Erikson, etc... they will all be gone. Under this system of 'only the FA party can remove a bolt', you have to start with only the FA party can place one, or eventually anything can be bolted and never stripped.    Sometimes it is not about ideals, or even right and wrong, sometimes it is about gauging the probable end result. In this case, 'only the FA party can remove' is not acceptable.

    After thinking about this overnight, I came to the conclusion that it really doesn't matter that much to me (personally), because I've already done it many times, and this is just another case of climber against climber over relatively trivial issues.    If Randy returned Hot Flyer to its pre-bolted state, I'd have a new objective to try. Although I doubt I'd ever have the mind to do it on lead, Steve's suggestion to top-rope the route is fair enough and something I could accept.    If someone else removes the bolts, I question their authority. If the person is not the first ascentionist, then they have no right to remove bolts unless they represent the greater interests of the climbing community. To often, self-righteous individuals disregard the interests of their community and destroy something valuable that many enjoyed.  Bolt wars, the ice flows, ... etc. These acts are selfish and ego driven.    If the Boulder climbing community supported the pre-bolt Hot Flyer, I'd be OK with returning it to its original state; however, it is my opinion that this is not the case with Hot Flyer, and only a very few outspoken individuals are making this an issue and will do a disservice to the community by removing the bolts.

    I just want to clarify that I do not favor bolting existing trad routes.  I might even bust out the crowbar if I saw bolts on Arm's Bizarre.  However, I agree with AC that the circumstances with Hot Flyer are different, and these bolts are not so disturbing.  If Randy were to pull the bolts, I would be bummed, but that would be his right, and no one else's.  I understand the debate and the fear of setting a precedant by not condoning this.  However, pulling the bolts on this route is disservice to the entire climbing community.  Peace.

    Removing the bolts from this line is a terrible disservice to the climbing community.  Hot Flyer was certainly a bold ascent by Randy, and re-equiping the line was a good contribution by Mark.  The bolts are well placed.      The self righteous should be constructive, not destructive.  Focus your energy on putting up new bold lines.  You can write them up and then everyone will still know how hard core you are.
    Sep 12, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    My understanding of this situation is thus: Randy was asked if some bolts could be added to the climb to make it safer and was agreeable in the matter. When later hearing just how many bolts were added, he was/is somewhat dismayed.    Perhaps with a few less bolts, it would still have a degree of commitment but still be safe, as opposed to yet another mindless clip-up of which there are plenty around.
    Aug 2, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I have no problem with retrobolting if the 1st ascentionist gave his permission, although the bolt at  the crux seems poorly positioned, but I heard a slightly  different story. I heard that Randy wasn't asked, but that when told it had been bolted he didn't want to make an  issue of it. It's true that if it hadn't been retrobolted it wouldn't get as many ascents, but so what? The people who would  do the route, and there are those people around, would have a different experience than just ticking another .12a, they would probably feel the quality more intensely. Why should those who value that quality be deprived? If you want to toprope it, it can be accessed via PLAN B, so that's not an absurd idea. I know somebody who doesn't know any better will trot out that old line about how you don't have to clip the  bolts...at the very least my experience has been that  it's like seeing a movie and somebody who's seen it already is describing the plot out loud behind me. The annoyance factor spoils the show. Having a running  monologue in your ear about the bolts and 'whether to clip it' and 'can you skip it' just isn't conducive to focusing on the climbing. There are a large number of  routes around here that would have been excellent with a few bolts but are quite forgettable at their over-bolted, lower standard.     This is the best route at the crag, but it could have been better.**

    I appreciate the value of a true hard trad climb and hate to see these all retro bolted. I agree that marginal fixed gear (such as questionable pins and copperheads) makes for a daring lead for the FA but is really silly and irresponsible for future climbers as this type of lead does not use solely clean gear.  As such, adding bolts does not seem unreasonable. If the FA had placed all gear on lead, without pins, then I would think differently. I know people are against seeing bolts added to old trad routes, but I hate nothing more than trying to lead a route that relies on pins, that were new and good 20 years ago, but are now crap. Fixed gear is fixed gear whether it is bolts or pitons.
    Dec 5, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Originally done ground-up.      The problem with keeping a route like this in the original style is the FA party had a hammer and placed heads and a marginal pin or 2.  So even though a very dangerous lead for the FA, the gear was adequate, but the climb only gets more dangerous for subsequent ascents over time as the fixed gear erodes.      A similar example is the style of the FA of Stratosphere and Air Voyage in the Black where Coyne and/or Leavitt placed marginal fixed gear (poor quarter inch bolts, heads, etc.) with a hammer for the FA gear (and on rappel by the way).  This is a style of FA that provides adequate pro for the FA team and really just sandbags future ascentionists.      Hot Flyer is a classic sport climb, and although I hate to see trad routes retrobolted, it seems to work in this instance.
    Dec 5, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The reason I asked how it was done is to find out if it was originally worked on TR, pro placed on TR, etc. There is a world of difference between true ground-up climbing and headpointing, and plenty of so-called trad routes relied on these tactics without explicitly mentioning their use. In some ways, I agree that the route should have been left unbolted, but I doubt anyone would ever do it these days. In part, this is because it isn't hard enough to attract the attention of most climbers who would want to take the risk. It would become a museum piece instead, looked at but rarely climbed. Again that could be a good thing, but I have to say I prefer the hypocrisy of leading a once-scary route on bolts and admiring the skill of the FA to hassling over a TR setup for a single 12a pitch with a 30 minute uphill approach. Most people, myself included, wouldn't bother.

    Bobbi's redpoint was awesome, today, especially after the effort we spent working the route Friday &amp; today. It has been 18 years since I redpointed this route. Chris Alber was the first to send the route on March 8, 1997. For him, the route flowed easily &amp; he called it .12c. In fact, he'd sent it two or three times before I finally redpointed it on March 23, 1997. Hot Wire was my first hard tick after recovering from a shoulder injury. I thought it was .12d. It took me longer to redpoint it than any other .12d at Security Risk. I rated it .12c/d in my last Boulder Canyon guidebook, because I was uncertain on the grade. The route would be rated .12c if it ended at 6th bolt. Then almost every move is 5.11 until above 10th bolt. It's tricky climbing, &amp; the most obvious way may not be the easiest sequence. This long section of the route could easily be rated .12a. After a great no hands rest below the 12th bolt, the overhung headwall is .12a/b above the bolt. Hard to cheat through this section.   Great route even though it needs a fixed chain draw on 5th (crux) bolt to make this clip easier.  It is important to mention Rick Leitner on the first ascent, since he bolted &amp; cleaned the route. Then he recruited me. I straightened out the line at 9th &amp; 10th bolts making it more sustained. I pulled off the key hold starting the crux but luckily held onto it &amp; didn't drop it. I glued it back on as I felt it would nearly impossible without it. Nothing was chipped or manufactured. Nothing at Security Risk is chipped. Leitner established a lot of routes in Boulder Canyon in the 1990s. He didn't chip or manufacture anything until 1998. Adam Brink who thinks this is chipped is pretty ignorant &amp; judgmental. We recruited Chris for the first redpoint. I should mention that he didn't own a drill until 1998.

    Absolutely loved sending this route today. It was mental all the way to the anchors. Clipping the bolt over the roof was probably the crux of the route for me, because I had to climb out of sequence in an unnatural way, make the clip, to get into the crux. Who knows, being a mere 5'4" has its challenges :). There's some good rests here and there, but it is very continuous to a hard section at the very top. This route is just as awesome as its neighbor, Plan B. Good rock, super cool position, and the view of the Indian Peaks at the top of this 100 foot route doesn't suck either!

    I, myself, am surprised that I hadn't been on this rig until today. As for the quality, etc, I am a full on route snob and despite a couple holds of questionable integrity, I thought the movement was quite enjoyable. As for the (crux) hold enhancement accusations...I think the "mini strip-steak" hold starting the crux, which obviously was glued back on, should be removed and the climb sent without it. It appears that there will be ample hand grips in its absence; just a little bit harder, perhaps. As far as the right-hand sidepull, that one looks like it maybe was gouged out, but it's hard to say for sure. My impression is this route musta bin way dirtier and for a while, post FA. I'd say it cleaned up rather well. I'd knock it one star for the massive rest at the top and the slightly contrived feeling of the moves getting up to the last roof lip.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I thought this was a great route, and as it cleans up with a bit more traffic it will only get better.  It's very continuous and felt solid at the 12c grade--the thought-provoking crux is followed by 5 or 6 bolts of sustained 5.11 climbing.  If you're tired of the overgraded one-move wonders in Boulder Canyon, check this thing out.     As for the alleged chipping, like Dan said it's hard to tell based on appearance.  It certainly doesn't climb like a chipped route, especially at the crux, which could easily have been dumbed down a couple notches with one strategically placed quarter-pad crimp.      Either way, it's a really fun route well worth a reconnaissance burn at a minimum.

    Fantastic route despite the claims of it being chipped (hard to tell).  It does have a lot of rock scars and friable rock in the upper dihedral, but the roof crux is way cool and the climbing very sustained -- 100 foot (30 meter) pitch. The flake at the chains is suspect and will eventually pull off (beware).  Combined w/ Hot Flyer and Plan B in a single outing -- this would be a great power-endurance workout.

    This route is flippin' hard. I have heard by many that the route has a height-dependent crux and many people do it dynamically.

The feet were very tricky in a lot of spots, beta was a bit tricky to figure out at the crux (especially if your short), and the final pull over the lip requires some juice, hence where the route probably gets its name. Great route, though!!!

    I found the second clip a bit awkward, but not particularly scary; maybe I was oblivious to the groundfall potential.  I would have given the route two stars but for the sixth bolt, which does seem in the wrong place like Ivan says.  You have to go quite a bit left of the bolt line and then traverse right using the small crystal foothold, which wasn't clear to me for a while.  That was probably the most difficult move for me.  The crux move through the dike wasn't terribly difficult for me because I did a huge left high step and was able to reach up to the jug.  The last moves diagonally up to the anchors were fun.  Since the anchors are well to the right of the bolt line it is somewhat difficult to clean.

    "Relentless" is right on. I don't think there's a single move easier than about 5.11d for the first 60ft or so. Fantastic climbing.

    Plan B has been one of my favorite climbs since it was established in 1994. It is always a super pump with fun moves. Here are the first ascent facts: F.A.: Ken Trout in Feb. 1994. F.F.A.: Henry Lester in April 1994. Finished added (F.A. of entire route) by Mark Rolofson in July 1994. Most people still stop at the first anchor. I find the finish, even though not as hard, rounds out the pump. It climbs the entire 95 ft. face rather than ending it on a slabby section. Ken was using 50 meter ropes so it made sense to put the anchor here.    Now I would like to make one very important correction to Ken Trout's comment. Yes, the name comes from being our Plan B of the day. However, Henry &amp; I were not planning on SNEAKING into the Flatirons to climb Slave To The Rhythm on the East Ironing Board. In fact, until that very day, the East Ironing Board was never closed. I used to climb here in Spring 1991-92 until I redpointed Slave To The Rhythm in June 1992. Henry had not yet redpointed the route but was close in Spring 1994.    At the time, the Third Flatiron's Southwest face was closed for a prairie falcon. When it was discovered that a peregrine falcon was nesting there, an emergency closure was put in place. We &amp; other climbers were turned around by a ranger at Bluebell shelter. The peregrine was on the endangered species list at the time, so the seasonal closure was expanded to include the Third Flatiron &amp; everything for a 2 mile radius. It still is this size even though the peregrine falcon was delisted in 1999.    My point here is that even though I am a strong critic of both seasonal closures of the Security Risk &amp; the East Ironing Board, I have never violated or attempted to violate any raptor closure. In fact, such actions reflect negatively on the entire climbing.

Actually, my friend had been out climbing with Mark Rolofson a lot and was more like:  "So Ken, is it Plan B because you couldn't do it and went elsewhere?"      No!  It was Mark and Henry's Plan B.  Plan A was to sneak into the Flatirons and try "Slave to the Rhythm", but the first ever spring bird closure was in effect and a ranger found them.  They were sent packing back down the trail.    Mark knew I had bolted something big. I even told him it would be cool if a bunch of other people would do the route so some chalk would build up on the holds.  I was sick of grubby, dirty, first ascents. At the time, there was nothing else in Boulder Canyon with millions of bolts.  Mark convinced Henry that the best alternative plan for the day was to head up and do the route before me.  I wrote the song, and they played it first.

    Fantastic climb - best I've been on in Boulder Canyon.  Great cold weather climb - gets the sun around 11 am until sunset.  Nice suntrap in the corner.  1st clip is reachy if short - consider a stick clip.  Can skip the 3rd bolt.

    This is a superlative route.  I have made it my goal to redpoint this route; if I do, I shall be able to retire from climbing and life.  The route is very aesthetic, on a nice granite face with the starkly-delineated pink dike running throughout, yielding many crystalline holds.    The extension brings the pitch closer to a full 30m, but contains much easier climbing and is still fairly dirty.  It can be skipped.  The route begins to receive sun shortly before noon.  After working through the 5th-bolt sequency crux many times, I can provide some beta:  clip 5.  Do not go right to the dike; on this path lies only despair.  Put left hand on L-facing arete; bring R foot down to ramp directly underneath you.  Lieback to R; get L foot high and left to very small edge.  Crank up on arete and L foot to get 2-finger undercling flake with L hand.  Move R foot higher up ramp.  Get R hand high to diagonal crimper.  R foot higher.  Match L hand to crimper.  In a balancy move, reach R to sloper under 6th bolt.  Switch feet, clip 6 with L.

    Thanks, Dale and Bruce, for the new anchor. We were up on Plan B when you were replacing. Really appreciate the effort!!! Went up today and saw the nice shiny new equalized anchor bolts.      Direct start was very hard for me. Green and yellow Aliens protect it well, but climbing straight up the crack (instead of "cheating" the start using the blocks out left and moving back right above the crack) is solid 5.10, if not a low 5.11 move on those thin finger locks. Not much for feet getting off the ground. Felt harder than any move on the upper section of Get Smart. Maybe I am just missing something obvious though or too short (5'9" in shoes). Easy to place the cams, then clip the 1st, then back clean the cams. 5.9 minus the "direct" start sounds about right for Bocan.    There are several spots for small cams and nuts on the way up if you feel like doing a mixed trad lead.

    Dale Haas and I did some anchor renovation on this route.  We removed the upper cold shut and bolt.  We also replaced the cold shut hanger on the lower bolt with a SS Fixe.  We added a new bolt, Powers SS, next to the lower bolt and added SS Quick Links and SS rap rings to both bolts.  The hardware for this project was provided by the American Safe Climbing Association(ASCA - safeclimbing.org).  Support of the ASCA is greatly appreciated.

    The two anchor bolts at the top of this route were poorly placed, one bolt being about a foot higher, but also six inches to the left of the other bolt. With several quicklinks and links of 3/8" chain, I was able to create a situation where both bolts are both about equally loaded. Now, if one bolt fails, the other should not be shock loaded.    The welded cold shut on the lower bolt is definitely showing signs of wear, hopefully this was because of the improper placement of the bolts and not because someone is belaying and lowering directly through the anchor. I was not able to figure out how the lower of two cold shuts would be the one to show wear unless people were clipping a draw into the upper bolt and threading the rope through the lower cold shut which would create an equalized anchor.

    The first clip is most easily placed from the stemming position described, but may be difficult for shorter people.  I really liked this route.  It had a lot of nice laybacking.  I thought it was on the high end of 5.9 in terms of difficulty.

    A good route and very useful as a warm up for some of the nearby routes.  However, it's very unfortunate that this route includes so many bolts within inches of easily protectable cracks.      Tom Hayes and I put up the S Buttress in 1993 on natural gear about a year or so before Pup went in.  The S Buttress starts at the same place as Pup but goes straight up instead of right near the first bolt on Pup, then traverses in where the 4th bolt is located, then goes up the same line from there.Really no need for bolts at all above the 3rd, a standard rack enables very safe gear placements.

    To make the first clip, place a small cam--green or yellow Alien. Then step right to a foothold from the block on the left. Don't climb from below (that's hard).    I thought the rest of the route was quite easy but  very nice. The first clip is also easy if done as described above.

    Sure felt harder than 5.9 to get to the first clip, but I am not very tall.  My 5'6" partner though it was VERY hard.  The higher crux felt like 5.9 though, for both of us.

    I went back and led this with Steve last week and I must say this is a quality 5.10 trad route. A nice addition as there are not many at this grade in the area. Clipping the 1st bolt of "Crash Test" is a good way to avoid any danger from falling on the tree at the start, but the rest of the route goes nicely with gear.

    Nobody in my party today particularly enjoyed this one. It's not a bomb, but one star. It's just weird. Like Keith, I'm normally all for technical moves, but it just wasn't very fun. I squeezed into the slot between bolts 1 and 2 which was a bit nerve wracking, though not super hard.    The book says moving onto the face on the left isn't the crux, but that part actually felt the most straightforward after all the awkwardness below it. For me, the crux was getting to the first bolt, though I probably read it wrong.    Also agreed with Tony, no need for the sling. Once you're there, it's 5.easy to the chains.

    Fun route, although a little confusing at the middle tier of the three roofs. There are two lines of bolts above the first roof. I was intending to climb T&amp;F but moved back right which (I think) was Avenger [now clarified as Fatman and Robin]. I clipped after I gained the roof, but clipping as you move from left to right is probably a better idea.  I found the move to be a little harder than Merry Men. Very balancy as you're forced to push out with you left hand from below as you try to find something for your right.    The middle section has some great stemming moves once you reach the right-facing block. No hands!

    We found this climb by counting two climbs right of Sheriff's Tariff (an obvious line up the white dike). The second last bolt moves right of Tuckered and Fired then back left and shares the last bolt + anchors.
    Jun 1, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    It took a while to figure out which route might be right of 'Tuckered and Fried', but only 2 routes left of 'Little John', because there are 3 routes between.  Eventually we settled on the conclusion that the left most of the uncertain routes was easier (Fatman and Robin), and the right route was harder (The Avenger).  This route is 2 routes to the right of Tuckered and Fried.    Which anchor are you supposed to finish on?  You can go left or right from the last bolt, or perhaps directly up (which I did for 20 feet or so though one more roof).  Seems like another anchor could add more climbing, one more bulge, and leave it separated from the others.    The best of the 'new' routes here. Jugs through a roof for a crux, but I didn't find a crux down low as stated in the description.

    This was a FUN route! Just wondering if anyone else has found that you can stem from the small dihedral/arete to the far right flaring crack? Or a knee bar @ the first roof? Also, any beta on the moves over the second roof? They seemed a little sketchy and took a bit of mental strength for what I consider a  10. I'd call it a 10+.

    Thin 5.10 face climbing with some tricky moves leading to an imposing roof.  A little "new route grunge" doesn't detract from the quality of the moves.  I clipped the 6th bolt over the roof and moved left to bigger holds instead of tackling the roof directly.  Moving back right was a challenge and I took a few hangs to figure out the moves.  I eventually got back on route and finished the climb.    The way I did it was harder than 10c and my initial attempt at tackling the roof directly felt harder than 10c, so I'll give the route an 11a grade .    Next time, I'll try the roof straight on and see if I can figure out the sequence.

    I lead this bottom section on gear.  You could pretty much stand just above the ground and place a very small stopper or RP to protect the first move to good gear.  I didn't bother and just clipped the bolt.  Then lead on good gear until the start of the dihedral.  After that it would be dicey on gear at best.     I won't even bother with the gear/bolt debate above, and I just lead it because I enjoy placing gear.  Probably could just bring 4-5 cams for this.  I placed a #0.5, #1, #3, and a yellow Alien.  Probably should have used a #2 as the #3 is high on the pillar as Ron mentioned.  You probably could find some crap in the dihedral, but why bother.  This isn't Serenity Crack.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I brought my trad rack to Sherwood Forest this afternoon and led Little John's Big Stick on gear.  The direct start up the corner is hard and poorly protected, so I came in from the right and got a bomber #3 Camalot as my first placement, just as Tony says.  Above, I got solid placements with a #.75 Camalot and a red Alien before reaching the detached pillar.  I put a #2 Camalot in the crack at the base of the pillar,  but avoided putting a bigger cam up higher.  At the horizontal crack I got a good red tricam.  From here, it's three bolts to the anchor.    My assessment: LJBS is a reasonable and fun climb done in this manner.  All gear placements are in solid rock, and the #2 Camalot placed at the base of the detached pillar would exert mimimal levering on the pillar in the event of a fall (which is unlikely since the climbing is easy in this section).

    Bob,  I sent you this before, but so long as you continue lighting fires pretending this does not exist, I guess that my moral compass says it is the least of the possible evils to post it. Richard, if you are reading this, forgive my divulsion of a personal email. Since you said you wanted to avoid a bolt war, I am acting in my best conscience in posting this to do so. Maybe I shoulda done it a long time ago, maybe you shoulda.    Maybe, Bob, you are interested in this because you've bolted handcracks yourself such as up in CCC on the Crystal Tower, chipped holds in climbs, and claimed the FA of routes you have never climbed... but I digress.    So here is the permission from Richard. Apparently there is confusion and I generally don't like posting formerly private emails, but if it will put a bolt war to bed, here it is.    -----------------------  "Tony,  Thanks for contacting me directly. Frankly, LJBS has always been an after-thought in my mind. Not a big deal by any means. I could care less whether it is bolted from the start or trad, so if you are in the area and want to yank them, have at it. If you do pull them, it would be a good idea to have this noted somewhere. While it would not take a rocket scientist to see that some pro would be useful, with the notation placed in the route description, someone could plan on taking the gear. We should be careful not to start an all-out trad-sport conflict.     (Insert- I have removed a few sentences of text here regarding other bolted cracks and their locations and FA parties which I don't know Richard would approve of me posting.)    Perhaps if it is clear that the FA party is in agreement, or doesn't care, then it may be less of a declaration of open warfare.      -Richard "  ------------    Bob, are you satisfied now that this is public? Can we move on?  You can call it alleged if you like, and I won't argue. You know well enough though that I am honest and try to do right, and I think you know (regardless of what you might say in public) that I am not making a word of that up.    Richard's 'consensus' statement was much later and in the context of involving a local bolt chopper and what he said was: -----------"So long as there is no disagreement about bolt removal, it may not matter a great deal who does so. But, I do agree that ************ is probably the wrong choice."---------    So let's not cloud that any further. Let's move on. Regardless of what was said later, I was given permission to remove the bolts and that is clear. Richard also warned me that it might touch something off. He was right. I did what I did because I saw something touching off if I didn't and I though that the bolts were unnecessary and that proper removal (clean, non-violent, with permission) is better than hanger-smashing, which is less reasonable and certain to enrage.    Now that all of the facts are out, I have nothing further to say. I accept the responsibility for what I did, and I accepted it openly before. But I'm not taking crap for what I didn't do and I absolve myself from any responsibility for the future. I told you what I think is impending and if it happens, remember I told you about it in advance and you made your own choices. I'm over it.

    On second reflection, perhaps it is all well and good to hold an ethical discussion over a minor route. It's likely that there would not be much to discuss if the bolts had been placed on the 5th pitch of the Naked Edge, or up Pervertical Sanctuary. Like all good discussions this one has at least two worthy and rational sides to it.  Tony approached me with the proposition that because popular opinion seemed to lean heavily toward pulling the bolts on LJ, he would do so if I consented. This was a level headed, reasonable, and anything but hysterical request, and that is certainly one characteristic of his. What I told him, in what was hopefully no more agitated a state of mind, was that I personally thought it not a good idea to get into something that smacked of an ethics police "vigilanteeism", but if the general tenor of things favored removal, then pull them. What the F***, I wasn't heavily invested in it in any way and I had no trouble accepting consensus opinion. Bob's argument is every bit as reasonable, and please correct me if don't say this right. The crag was developed largely with bolts since most the routes needed them, and the dozen feet of climbing in question don't add up to very much. There is also a very long tradition in climbing to leave a route in the form of its original ascent, and stripping LJ invites vigilantee bolt wars, and it gives unwarranted credence to the most vitriolic element. Furthermore, the tolerance implicit in Bob's stance provides an opportunity for the climber to exercise their own judgement in their own work. We're climbers afterall, and at least one of the reasons we climb is to define ourselves differently from the 9 to 5 herd mentality that consumes most of our lives. If one tries to cobble together these different sides, along with Steve's position, then it seems to me that we come up with something like the following. If you are putting in new routes, then for the most part you will be working on something you don't own and putting in a route does not confer any greater ownership on the crag.  It's still not yours. There is a general preference in Colorado that if the balance of a pitch can be done trad,  then leave it trad. If consensus wisdom argues for adjusting a route by adding or removing bolts, then accept the decision based on the greater wisdom. We can all make mistakes. However, I would also add that if we are going to preserve the individuality of climbing and if we are going to recognize the investment that each climber places in climbing, then we are going to have to accept that some things will be done differently than we might choose ourselves. If we can't do this, then climbing is not worth the effort.

Kudo's to Richard: there are ethical quandries about both placing and removing bolts next to potential gear placements that's I'm unprepared to deal with unilaterally. I removed these bolts with permission, and without it would not have done so. So maybe there was a different "choppin' posse" forming, but I wasn't part of it.

    Top Rope Hero is right on with the above comment. I think that this line is no harder than 10c/d unless you stay directly in line with the bolts. Moving left on the slab at the 2nd bolt is the most logical, obvious, and natural feeling way to do this route and keeps you well within arm's reach of the bolts. I tried to find the 11- moves by staying directly on the bolt line last night. It is certainly harder and probably 5.11 doing it this way, but it felt really contrived. It's a fun route no matter how you do it, but I agree that its not an 11- unless you really want it to be.

    Hmmm...Merry Men seems to be yet another one of those sport climbs that just can't decide what it wants to be.    11b?!? For Christ's sake. Sure, yah, I suppose if you restrict yourself severely to just certain holds, it'd clock in as an 11. But, like the vast majority of sport climbers out there, I consider anything within an arm's reach of the bolt line (like the nubs and the scrubs around to the left) to be decidedly in bounds (and NOT an "escape" as some would have it). Use those close-n-easy-to-reach, natural features on the left and Merry Men comes in at a merry 10d. Maybe even 10c. Challenging, but certainly NOT an 11.    The point? Don't. Inflate. Grades. If it's within reach, it's game. And if it's game, then WHY make a contrivance? Why make artificial a line that comes in just fine on its own, even if it's a bit easier than originally imagined?    Otherwise, let's just hack off a limb, wear Crisco for shoes, and call every thing out there a V37.

    Just an update. Did this route today and someone has been generous enough to fix the anchor situation referred to above. There is a sold two bolt anchor w/ rings directly above the line of the climb.

    I really liked this route. I climbed it clean just after doing another 11b, so it's probably more like 11a.  I escaped left and had a hard time cleaning the route. I couldn't tell if the route was supposed to continue through the lichen or stop at the 2 bolts that were 4 feet apart.

    Devious climbing if you don't escape left to the right-trending rail at the bottom.  The anchors seem straight up dangerous; too far apart, left one spins, and awkward to clip.  Besides, this thing should pull the roof; it looks like it would go sub 5.12. Maybe some new anchors (does anyone even care)?

    Fun route, hard down low, but I couldn't quite find the 11b staying straight on the bolts.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Although this as well as Robbin' The Hood are shown in the Rossiter Boulder Canyon guidebook (p. 47) as continuing past the 7th bolt, the rock above is covered in lichen.  We ended up traversing right along the ledge and continuing to the top of Prince of Theives, which ends up being about 12 bolts (total) to a 2 bolt anchor and makes for a nice, slightly longer linkup.

    Top left, cold-shut anchor is a spinner, with shaft and hole eroded, if folks clean off any more to the left, downgrade to 5.10, nevertheless still cool....

    I'm just barely giving this two stars, and that's really only for the "boulder problem" to the first bolt. We also didn't notice any loose rock, and the moves between the 5th and 6th bolt were thought provoking. Certainly merits more than a star, but it wasn't particularly memorable. Worth doing if you're in the area and nobody's on it.    All that said, it's probably a pretty good first 5.10 lead.

    My partner trundled the boulders near the anchor today.  It's still got lichen in some of the places you need to smear, but it's getting cleaner and is worth getting on.  It's good to have a few warmups before sending Prince of Thieves.

    That big, fragile flake left of the 5th bolt was cleaned off today with the slightest tug and exploded below thanks to Dave.  Yeow!  There are still a couple of big, mobile chunks just below the anchor that could take out a belayer.  Beware.

    Pretty great route and the best at this crag. This would even be worth doing if you climb it at 5.11 C0, because even the climbing above the crux is pleasant.    I can see how some folks call this 5.12a. It seems as though this crag has a lot of contrivances and climbing about 10' right of the 2nd bolt, and then working back left to the 3rd bolt would put it at 12a and make it certainly less static than the 12b way.    Either way, it's a good route worth doing and feels pretty right on for the 12b grade going directly up from the 2nd bolt.

    This route is great. Just made a trip up to Sherwood Forest and certainly didn't expect the climb to be this good. For sure a classic with a great boulder problem down low and then fun climbing and somewhat of a long route for BoCo. Do it!

    I can't believe this route only gets two stars in the book! In my opinion, one of the best 12b's in the Canyon - bullet rock, cool moves, and pretty long by Bocan standards. Go do it!

    I'd grant this route three stars.  It's got a great sequency crux down low, a fairly sustained middle, and a pumpy finish.  I really had to work out the crux.  The feet are key.  Tony's advice is useful:  don't clip bolt 3 until it's at your waist.  Clipping from the sloper ledge below it will just burn you out.  Be sure to get a nice rest at the ledge under the roof, because the last part is pretty pumpy.  The fin at the top isn't that great; try to layback it.

    If this route is 12b and the beautiful arete at upper Animal World is 12b then we got a problem.  Either way, a fun route that is not in the least bit dynamic (and I'm only 5'10'').  Use the good feet through the crux.

    Tony- what do think of this line relative to Skippin' Stones in CCC?  That can of worms aside, this is a fun line with really one big move to gain the roof.  I think this was 11a- I can't flash 11d.
    Jul 23, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The holds tend to push you to the right towards Tuckered and Fried, for the first half of the route.  The moves are much easier the farther right you go, including at the roof.  Following or going left of the bolt line makes this route significantly harder (11d seems reasonable to me).  Otherwise the line of least resistance is 11-.
    Aug 25, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I don't know that there are any rules about which way to go, but the Left is the better line.     Not bad for a short route.  It gives the chance to do some overhang without too stout of a grade or getting too pumped.  If taking into account the critter poop that was on it this summer you'd subtract one of the two stars though.    5.10b right or 5.11a left -by modern sport standards. If comparing to a route like Gates Of Eden or Left Wing, then the route goes 5.9 right or 5.10a/b left, but let's face it, those are hard at the grade.
    Nov 8, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I think it's supposed to be 5.11d if you go over the roof and head left. It's not .11a, but it's not .11d either. Probably (by canyon ratings) an .11c... If you head right over the roof, it's about .11a.

    History and controversy aside, I think this is a fun route. If you stay completely off the block to the left (LJBS), it seemed like a nice 10a route with a 10+ tricky section before the ledge. Squeezed? Yes... but still a nice climb. Two stars in my estimation.

    LJBS is a trivial pile, at best a one star route on a one star crag. I did clip the bolts when it first went in, but personally would never have put them in in the first place, chopped them, or re-installed them.    The "disgusting affair" started with the wrong-headed chopping of the route. All we have is agreement with FA wishes and concensus in matters such as these, and it's pretty clear that neither were achieved before chopping.    Then, if Alan wanted to take a stand he should have simply re-equipped LJBS. Overlaying a pathologically squeezed and contrived "new route" just provides ammo for the choppers.    Disgusting? Check out cb.com, read the transcript, and decide for yourself.

If you can reach it and the bolt at the same time, it's on. Which I guess makes these bolts, or some of them anyway, still "on" LJBS.  But whatever....    There would be more to talk about if this were harder than 10a.
    Aug 20, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Ray,    The red tape never was on the pillar; that was always off route.    There is a long history of contrived routes where certain holds were deemed off-route to make the climbing harder.    Here are two examples from Eldorado.  I quote from Ament and McCarty's "High Over Boulder", 1984 edition:    p.  335:  "Psyche-Gill-Logical, 5.10b.  FA Pat Ament, Dale Goddard 1984.  Just left of the Birdwalk is a little right-angling finger crack in an almost overhanging wall.  The crack takes fingers and nuts and is one of the nicest short pitches in the area.  Climb about 15 feet up the left variation of Birdwalk and make a move left to the base of the finger crack.  FOR PURITY, AVOID A SMALL PROTRUSION OF ROCK ON THE RIGHT (NEAR THE TOP OF THE CRACK). "    p. 416:  "Joke Crack 5.11.  FA Alec Sharp, Leonard Coyne, 1981.  This climbs a finger crack in a slightly overhanging wall just right of Chockstone.  Climb a chimney to the top of the pillar on the left, then ascend the finger crack USING ONLY THE WALL TO THE LEFT OF THE INSIDE CORNER CRACK."    (There is an easy stem over to the Purple Haze corner which knocks the difficulty of Joke Crack way down.)    So the fact that TBLS places certain holds off-route puts it in the same category as these old Eldorado trad routes done by icons of the Boulder climbing community.    Climb the route Alan's way, climb it your way; it really doesn't matter.  Personally, I enjoyed the challenge of avoiding the holds that didn't have the tape!

The red tape must have fallen off.    The stylistically confused can just climb the obvious link-up "Little John Made Marian," which catches the only good climbing on either Stick at the headwall.
    Aug 20, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Crusher,    When I climbed Little John's Big Stick (on gear) and Tony Bubb's Little Stick (clipping bolts) last week, I climbed two independent lines to the top of the detached pillar.    My honest assessment of TBLS is that it is:    a. A squeeze job.    b. Contrived.    c. Climbable without using holds on LJBS to the top of the pillar.  d. Fun climbing    You may give it a bomb rating because of a. and b., but I give it one star because of c. and d.    I'm pretty sure that most folks who gave the route a bomb rating in the earlier incarnation of this route description had not climbed the route, but were reacting to what they thought was a direct replacement of the bolts on LJBS.
    Aug 19, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is not a new route. This is rebolting Little Johns's Stick, but the new bolts are now a bit further away, like five feet right. The person who rebolted this should have explained what they did, and why, not invent some new line three or four feet to the right of the LJBS dihedral. I climbed this last week, without any knowledge of the vast archive of postings about LJBS.    Placing the new bolts an arm's reach away from the LJBS dihedral is a tasteful way of resolving this rebolting issue, so the bolts are not right in your face if you choose to climb the dihedral on gear, but this is a terrible way of posting the information.    It's puzzling to see folks posting nice comments as if this really was a nice addition to the crag. It's sad to see folks removing all the highly critical comments that were posted here a few days ago (if a dozen "bomb" ratings all posted in a couple days are not a consensus about a route's worth, I don't know what is).

    Fun moves up the thin face between Little John's Big Stick and Maid Marian.  There's a 10d crux moving from the 4th to 5th bolts and another hard move at the 6th bolt.    It's possible to climb the route at an easier grade by stemming the corner on LJBS, but for full value, avoid the corner and stick to the face.     The bolts on this route are well to the right of the bolts that were removed from LJBS, so this really is a new and independent climb.

    A fun route that seemed a little harder than 10a.  Bring a #.75 or #1 Camalot sized piece to anchor the belayer; the starting ledge is exposed and it's a dicey move to the first clip.  The crux is a difficult mantel past the third bolt.  The route is 95' long.

    Nice route and thought the rock was generally good though the route was a little dirty getting to ledge 2.

    On P3, instead of swinging left to avoid the roofs, you can clip the last bolt prior to them and then go directly upward on underclings and kneebars over the roof and to the anchor. You skip the 2nd to last and perhaps last bolt this way, but it's very good climbing and not runout. It is probably a shave harder than the given 10c grade. Maybe 10d/11a?

    When you get to this climb, turn and look across the canyon. You will see Animal World, a clean and challenging crag. That is where you should've gone, hahaha. Unless you like smearing lichen and crimping moss.   If you do find yourself in need of a dirty adventure, bring screwlinks and place them on the bolts at the second belay (there are no rap rings here, but there should be, as it is the most sensible way to rap...from the top, to the second belay, to the ground...with a 60m).

    I really liked this route: fun, interesting climbing from bottom to top, in a spot isolated from other routes on the cliff.  Some dirty rock doesn't detract from the quality of the moves.    We stashed our gear at the start of Arcanum (just right of the one-bolt belay anchor by "Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid"), then scrambled about 100'  right toward a tall pine tree visible on the skyline.  The rappel bolts to access the route aren't visible until you top the pillar just left of this tree.  An 85' rappel got us to the big terrace below the route.    I wouldn't recommend rappelling in from the top of the route, unless you just wanted to do the last pitch or the Orgasmatron finish (11b). We rebuilt the small cairn marking the top, but it's hard to see from a distance.  Also,  there are no rap rings on the anchors atop the first and second pitches.    Ivan's beta is excellent, as usual. The first pitch starts with some steep bulges that felt 5.9 to me, but were much harder for my shorter partner.  Then fun stemming moves that seemed about 10a.  I followed Ivan's advice and ran the first two pitches together; this was a good idea.The climbing in this section included a neat quartz crystal band and a clean arete and slab - 5.7 or 5.8.  Bring a few longer runners to keep down rope drag.    The final pitch was outstanding:  thin stemming moves up a steep corner, somewhat reminiscent of Over the Hill; I'd call it 10b or 10c.I felt comfortable with the bolts for pro; I brought some wired nuts but didn't use them.  The 5.8 friction slab after the corner was fun as well.    After scrambling to the top of the rock and going a bit left, look down left for a big cairn marking the traverse to the anchors atop Arcanum.  Two rappels (85' and 90') with a 60m rope got us back to our gear.    Check out this route if you're looking for an "adventure sport climb".

    Really nice route.  The 4th clip over the lip is not that easy to make.  Consider putting a draw on that bolt and perhaps a long sling - one can yard on the draw and then step in the sling to reach the jug hold above.  Without the long sling you have to make a 10 slab move to reach the jug.      I really didn't feel much at all to grab onto above the lip to try the route free.  I wonder if anything has broken off in the last 9 years?

    The 10a layback up a ramp past the 3rd bolt leaves you in a tenuous position to make the 4th clip.  My partner, who is 5'5", didn't think she could reach the clip if she were leading.  The next move is the 12a/b crux (A0 if you yard on the draw).  Shorter climbers be forewarned.    There's a great belay ledge at the top of the climb; bring your partner up and enjoy the view before you rappel back down.

    The route is closer to 180' as the comment and 2-pitch text beta above and NOT 130', as in the route description headers. It is a good as a single pitch though, with proper use of slings. The station at 1/2 way down makes it a single rope route, with 2 raps.  We re-cleaned this route on 8/5/06 and cleaned it hard. Removed some loose flakes, moss and dirt. The dust has not quite cleared, but the rain today should take care of that, and the route is better now.

    A fun route.  Two cruxes on the first pitch: at the start of the steep crack, and at an overhang near the top of the crack.  Be sure to finish the pitch in a right-facing corner with a bolt; don't angle left or you'll wind up on Sunshine Makes Me Paranoid.    The entire climb can be done as one 180' pitch, avoiding a tiny belay stance at the top of the first pitch.  If you do this, be sure to work out rope signals with your partner, since you won't be able to hear each other.

    Nice route with a trad crux. .10a seems about right. Ivan's gear recommendations are spot on -- but if you don't have a double set of Aliens, a single set complemented by #6-#8 Stoppers and a 0.5 Technical Friend should do the trick. Cams larger than a 2 1/2 Friend are unnecessary.     On the other hand, test the 2"x24", decomposing vertical flake in the crack below the last roof carefully. It's an attractive hold but felt loose to me.

    Did this again, clean this time, barely, despite having a human belayer and knowing the moves. If there was a decent foot hold to rest on at the crux, this would be 5.9 for me (but see Bruce's disagreement regarding the approach crack). As it is, there's a thin edge for one foot and a rattly jam as you clip the bolt and lean out. If you're extra cool, you could place the high gear and clip the bolt, then downclimb a body length to think about it. Compared to other 10s on this crag, this is one of the hardest to onsight in my opinion (having onsighted all of the others, and half of those self-belayed).
    Aug 21, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I don't know, Ivan ... I think I used the foothold you described (a small triangular edge where the crack intersects the little overhang at the base of the corner), but, at 5'11", my skinny hands were rattling around in the crack, not jamming. I didn't reach good handholds until I stemmed up to the roof and began the traverse. And my 5'3" wife -- who has really small hands -- was totally flummoxed by the corner. I certainly agree that bomber hand jams would knock 2 or 3 letter grades off my very subjective .10d-.11a rating -- so .10b may be an accurate rating for the hypothetical "average climber." Caveat emptor, I guess.
    Sep 20, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Bruce, I think you did miss something. There's a foothold at the bottom of the crack that's hard to see unless you lean out. Stepping on that allows you to reach the bomber hand jams. But maybe you're shorter or, as you said, your hands are smaller, so that was harder. I self-belayed so no way is it hard 10 or 11a for me. Easy 10 trad or mid to hard 10 sport is my limit self-belaying.    As for gear, the gear list I posted matches what you say more or less: double in 0.75 to #3 Camalot, #3.5 Camalot, #4 Camalot (could do without).. The "could do without" refers to the #4 Camalot. By making the first move in the crux crack you can place a hand-sized cam above the wide spot.    In any case, when I did it, the top of the crack was wet, and I was unable (more like unwilling) to cleanly clip the bolt and make the reach out to the bucket. That part was the crux for me.
    Sep 19, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Maybe my crack-climbing technique has atrophied, maybe my hands are smaller than Ivan's, or maybe I just missed something -- but the hanging corner below the traverse to the first bolt felt awfully hard for .10b (i.e., more like .10d or .11a). I couldn't find the "inobvious footholds" and had to stem from ripples on the left wall to smears on the right wall. Decent jams were in short supply as well. Fortunately, I was able to get a bomber #4 Friend in the roof capping the corner and then clip the first bolt before committing to the (easier) "crux" traverse.    Ivan's gear recommendations may be a little conservative too. I'd call a #4 Camalot, a #3.5 Friend, and a #4 Friend mandatory for the corner -- and two #3 Friends (or a #3 and a #3.5) advisable for the wide section 10' or so below the second bolt

    Rather airy and scary, maybe because it was dark, licheny, wet, and close to Halloween. I missed the bolt above my head on the traverse left. The rope got totally stuff on lowering, as I descended the left side of the arête, and then had to reclimb the crux section to free it.

    Fun climb with good movement.  Crux was a little reachy as I am short but still totally do-able.  If you can get past the fear of the airy traverse, I would recommend NOT clipping the 6th bolt.  Even with a long sling, the rope drag made for a tougher than necessary lead.

    I backed off the arete move on sight - Strappo flashed it.  A beautiful pitch with an exciting finish, but harder than 10a.  We lowered through the belay with a 70m rope with no problem.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Greg Miller led this all trad yesterday. The only excitement is the last slab move which is above a micro cam that's a few feet below your feet. I then led it clipping the last 2 bolts. The arete move turned out to be much easier than I remembered, so I could have easily done it with just the last bolt. The arete move is protected by a fair micro cam, #00 TCU or purple Alien, with back up about 4 feet below. No gear for the first 30' or so off the ground, but it's easy.

    May 28, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route has some nice moves on the arete.  I didn't put a long sling on the sixth bolt; this bolt looks like it's exclusively for the route "Mind Bender, although clipping it might make the traverse move less worrisome.  I didn't need any gear on the rest of the route, but I'm tall so perhaps the clips were easier.  I wouldn't recommend the second pitch.  It's short, slabby, and covered in lichen.  However, if you do the second pitch, and belay from the tree, you can walk a bit to (climber's) right and rap off those anchors down to the Mind Bender pitch-1 anchors and reach the ground safely from there.  Rapping straight from the first-pitch anchors of Eight Miles could be problematic.       There is another route that starts about 6' to the right of Eight Miles High.  Maybe someone set up a new start for Mind Bender so that it no longer shares any bolts with Eight Miles High?

    Just want to reiterate Ivan's comment about lowering with a 60m rope.  If you do this, be sure the belayer is tied in to the end of the rope; the belayer will have to climb up a bit to get the leader all the way down.  Letting the end of the rope slip through the belay device would likely have fatal consequences for the leader.  Better to use a 70m rope if you're lowering, or belay from the top and get down via a 100' rappel.    I carefully inspected the left side of the arete, and did not find any usable footholds.  My partner and I did the crux move the same way: grab a protrusion on the arete with the left hand, and high-step the left foot onto a sloping foothold right on the arete.

I used a knob on the arete for my left hand, and high-stepped with my left foot onto the arete.  My partner did it the same way.  I'll have to try it your way next time; it has to be easier than what we did!

    Ron, Yes the crux is exciting, but the 100' of climbing leading to it is easy and not that interesting, although not unpleasant. At the crux, did you step around to the left side of the arete? There's a good hold there. I'm pretty sure I leaned left and stepped up with my right foot. As for lowering off, I was self-belaying, and so tied off the rope at the anchor and rapped the free end. As you say, it's probably not a good idea to lower off, and a 60m rope won't reach without the belayer climbing up a bit.Ivan

    An airy and exciting route.  The crux is a pumpy, committing high-step layback on the arete; my partner and I felt it was more like 10b or 10c than 10a.  The move is definitely harder if you're short.  I clipped an 11th bolt to the left at the top, but it may have been on another route (The Wave).    Bring up your partner and rap 100' back to the start.  We didn't do the second pitch; it looked very easy and uninteresting.

    Greg Miller onsighted the direct start yesterday all trad. The gear was very good. Blue Alien to .75 Camalot. The cams in the vertical crack are good straight down. You can get a directional below the crack which, if clipped short, keeps the rope from pulling out on the cams above. There's a very good small cam in the flake on the right, and bigger cams in the overlap.

My shorter partners couldn't make the reach to do the move this way, and ultimately had to aid the move.    The direct start, up a flared finger crack and over a roof, is strenuous and difficult.

    Some traffic would be really nice on this one. As it is now, it isn't bad, but it would be one of the better pitches in the canyon at the grade if it cleaned up a bit. Cruiser hand crack roof, fun bit of wider climbing at the top, what more could you ask for?    And there is no way this thing is any harder than 9+ at the absolute most.

    I'll have to second Ivan's thoughts here. The bottom felt 10a at hardest, and Pretty solid- I placed gear expecting hard moves, tehn just cruised it. But then I got higher to the wider section and slowed down quite considerably- fighting in and out of the back of that crack for fist-jams. I walked the #3 camalot up because I didn't have anything else bigger than hands with me. One move Felt like 5.9 up there.    If I were to do the climb again, I'd take cams from 1/2" to 4" (one each) and a double set of stoppers- this thing EATS large stoppers and I only had 1 set.

I consider a 3 star climb something I aspire to doing, something to dream about, if I haven't done it already. This climb, Lightspeed, is just one of very many similar climbs.     Maybe you can tell that I'm a trad climber at heart.

    Yup, the horn sure does flex when you crank over the crux roof. Be careful up there. The roof  coupled with the nice, sustained .10 something face climbing from the crux to the 7th bolt merits at least two stars.

    This route is awesome!  Excellent rock w/ excellent movement.  The horn at the crux flexes a little and may rip off in someone's face someday.  Nonetheless, this climb deserves 3-stars.  It is easy to combine this pitch w/ Aerial Boundaries for a fun 2-pitch sport route.  You can also do 2 raps w/ a 60M rope to get down.  Rap from the achors on Aerial to the anchors on Lightspeed, which are ~15 ft higher (and to climber's right) than the anchors at the start to Aerial.

    Challenging OS! we intended to climb Wings and wound up on MLK unknowingly. Started on Wings, skipped the 4th bolt, and went straight up on the steep slab to the 5th (?) bolt for MLK and finished straight up. The crux is thin and will test your footwork/creativity/tenacity. We lowered on a chopped 70m rope that got us to the ground with a few meters to spare. Our cord is probably &lt;60m.

    If you are below 6', the moves are going to be proportionally harder here and there.    If you are below 6', several of the clips are going to be even more proportionally difficult.    If you are anything between 5'0 and 6'6", however, the ledge fall from the crux headwall onto the flake/ledge is pretty much (if not precisely) the same... and if you are short, you'll likely blow the clip and fall from up there with that much more rope out.    Ditto the above for me. I was one more person trying to do Wings of Desire and getting suckered directly up on this one. Felt pretty hard for 11b. I'm not sure if it is 12a or not, what I can say is that it stays insecure for quite a while, and that adds up to something. You just have to stay on the whole time and focus, I guess.    I didn't manage the OS, so yeah, my ankle and wrist are sore. Like I said, the ledge fall is the same for everyone.    BTW - a rack from 1.25 to 3" cams might inspire more confidence on this route for shorter climbers in a few spots where there is some space between bolts, and then you can't reach from the good stances besides.

    My intent on Labor Day was to first climb "Wings Of Desire".  After climbing the start of that line to its 5th bolt on a sloping shelf, I clipped a 6th bolt only a few feet away up right.  Then I continued straight up the face.  I got to hard moves at the 11th bolt and fell off a couple times before dogging to the anchor.  I thought this is desperate for 5.11b.  My partner had a similar go.  We then realized that we were on "MLK".  It is possible and recommended to start with "Wings Of Desire" to climb "MLK" with just quickdraws for bolts.  In fact, looking up from the base of "Wings" the obvious direct line up the face is the upper part of "MLK".  "Wings Of Desire" goes left at 5th bolt up easy run-out terrain. "MLK" climbs straight up a left-facing corner to a good ledge.  Then up the face along a precarious, detached flake its top.  From here, climb a steep slab face passing a tiny roof. Some exciting climbing! 14 bolts / ring anchor (with "Wings" start).  This is an excellent climb with bolts in the right place.  Good job, Bob, on the route but not so good on the info in your guidebook.  If you do the crack start of "MLK", it seems like the obvious line is to join "Wings" at its 4th bolt on a sloping shelf &amp; continue up to its 5th bolt, then continuing straight up "MLK".

    Basically what Goldstein said, other than recommending the Wings of Desire start (which blows).  The route wanders too much to be great, hard to avoid rope drag, as the rope wants to run behind some flakes.  Several dicey clips up high.  Some nice rock on it, but also some crappy rock and lichen.

    Rapping w/ a 60m rope got me to the 2nd bolt.  The lower part of this climb seemed like a moss fest so you're probably better off starting w/ Wings of Desire.  The upper part is probably great if you're a true slabmaster (pure smearing w/ minute sloper "hands") -- I found it much harder than Mind Bender &amp; aided it.  Also, there is  a somewhat scary move getting to the crux, mantling above a vertical flake which you could fall onto if you blow the move; the clip after this move was also pretty dicey @ 5'7".

    Good job to Vaino and Bob.  Tony is correct, though.  When I first led this climb with Serena Benson in 1999, the wall was still streaked with rock powder from my old Bosch hammer drill. Dirt and lichen yet obscured critical holds.  I couldn't quite pull the final mantle and so responsibly graded the route 12a A0.   I never went back until recent times.  The route has cleaned up very well over the past 7 years and is a real beauty of a face climb. I find the final moves to be quite demanding, and I still grade the route 12a.    I experienced the same situation on the FA of Aerial Boundaries with Moe Hershof and Leah Macaluso, 1998.  This is another exceptional face climb and a very difficult one to do all free.  Though the crux is really a single move, it is not easily passed.  Most folks clip the bolt and yard off the quickdraw.  Kudos to Bob D. for getting it right.
    Sep 18, 2006

    I agree w/ Tony about the rating.  The headwall is quality climbing, but it is considerably easier than the direct start of Immaculate Deception (not to mention the crux of MLK).  Call it 11c, and it's still pretty easy in the grade.
    Sep 14, 2006

    Good rock and good route. The bolts through the crux are darn close together, but they were thoughtfully placed. The route still has a few moves left in it after the crux, too.  I think it may have been over graded though- perhaps the horizontal crack and sidepulls through the crux have cleaned up. Regardless, 5.11c or 5.11d seems more appropriate.

    Recommended to have your belayer tether themselves to the tree with a 10-12' runner, in order to be able to see the leader throughout the first pitch. On Sunday, I fell at the second to last bolt, and ended up taking a 30+ foot whipper due to 1) miscommunication, 2) the belayer assuming I was pulling rope for a clip, and 3) the belayer not seeing that I was going up and down on the same move several times. Ended up bruising my foot severely, hobbling down the hill, and across the river!

    Great route!  The first time I climbed this route, my buddy Brent and I were amazed that we were the only ones on the wall.  Animal World was swarming with people, and we had all of Sleeping Beauty to ourselves.  I can't believe that there isn't a line at the bottom of this route on the weekends.  The crux of the route is a mantel over a roof.  The move is outrageous!!!  It's not harder than 5.10+ (once you figure out how to do it), but you will probably find yourself laughing your ass off when you do it (like Brent and I were), or you'll be cursing Rossiter for grading the pitch 10c.  Climbing "Into the Mystic" and then this route make for 3 excellent pitches of climbing.  "Into the Mystic" hits the 2nd ledge 10 ft right of "Mystic Mile."  As a side note, the picture above has the anchors too low.  They are actually where the #2 is in the picture.  To climb "The Wave" traverse straight right from the anchors in the middle of "Mystic Mile."  I'm pretty sure that "The Wave" has a manufactured hold on it, but I'm not an expert on the subject (looked pretty suspicious).  I'm also pretty sure that "The Wave" isn't 10a.  It's MUCH harder than "Mystic Mile."

    Has cleaned up quite a bit. The gear is reasonable. A light rack to 3". 1st and 3rd bolts would be for want of longer slings. Anchors at the top are 5' too high and thus across a long edge. Belay up top and rap, lowering is hard on the ropes. A 60m should get you down OK.

    Worth doing. Two crux moves on it are harder than 5.9, the start/corner is mossy and has lichen, but indeed can be avoided on right. The way I did it, after the crack, join the bolts on the route to the right, but is quite a hard move onto the face. Maybe not if you are very tall.

    I enjoyed this climb, and it climbed better than I expected. Yes, the bottom 1/4 is dirty, but not enough to bother me. I was, not having read the beta, expecting a sport climb having climbed past the first and second bolts when doing the girdle a couple of years ago, but it climbs more like a trad climb. Fun stemming with trad gear to start (you can bypass that out right on the arete). A couple of interesting moves past two bolts over a bulge to access the arete. An easy trad hand crack (bring a red or gold Camalot), and then a puzzling move at another bolt to gain the slab. After a few minutes here, I went straight right then up, and it was easy, 5.9 at the most. Easy slab to the top. It seems like it joins the last couple of bolts of Aerials Boundaries. Is that true? Or did I miss other bolts further left?

    Some good moves past the first two bolts, but the climb is so dirty with moss, lichen and grunge that it's really not worth doing.  The dicey move past the third bolt is much harder than 9+; perhaps a hold broke?  Seemed more like 10c to me.

    I think the bolts on this route are spaced for a tall person.  I found I would climb to a bolt, clip it, and have some very easy climbing.  Then there would be a harder move right before the next bolt, so all the potential falls were long, and some had ledge fall potential.    The bolt at the crux is a very long reach.  If you wait to clip it until after you do the move, then you have the potential of breaking your ankles if you blow the crux.      I enjoyed the climb, maybe if I were 5'10" or taller I wouldn't be bothered by the bolts, but it just seemed to me that if several of the bolts were 6" lower, the climb would be far more mellow... but people like spice, right?

    Good climb. Tied with Mind Bender for the best route I have done there. The grade is probably height-dependent, going right at the bulge into the horizontal. A short climber would lose their good feet before matching hands in it.     You can continue on ??? for a 180' climb by clipping one bolt at the belay and going up and slightly left past a few bolts for 80 or 90 more feet to the top; belay on a tree at the edge or set a directional on this and head right to the 2nd pitch top-anchor of 'Arcanum'.  Two 1-rope raps (60M OR LONGER) will get you down.

    This is the only route with a one-bolt anchor at the base, although the start may be confusing.  There are two bolts visible 8-10 feet up, you want to go towards the right one.  This all sorts itself out once you start up, but from the ground I was confused.  I was pleasantly surprised at how fun this route was, from the start it looked iffy, but is well worthwhile.  My shorter partner found the moves under the roof pretty reachy, and hard a harder time than I did.  This climb is interesting the entire time, up to the second you clip the anchor.

    I went back and climbed this route again, this time doing the correct finish.  It is an excellent climb, one of the best I've done on Sleeping Beauty.There are 9 bolts on the pitch.    Here's how I would describe the climb:    Climb a low-angle slab and a steep corner below a roof.  Clip the fourth bolt and make a committing traverse right under the roof to good holds above the lip.  Clip the fifth bolt and surmount the roof (10b) to a stance.  Step right and climb steep rock past two more bolts.  Angle slightly left to the 8th bolt in a short, leaning, left-facing corner.  Swing right around the arete (10c), clip the final bolt, and continue up and left to the anchor.    In my earlier ascent, I angled right at the 7th bolt instead of left; this put me on Arcanum.    If you go to Sleeping Beauty, be sure to do this route!
    Aug 26, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I guess I was confused by the route description, which said to "continue up on good holds to a short corner then swing right and then straight up to the anchor."  This led me to the anchor on  Arcanum, which is up to the right at the top of a short corner.    The party I saw that went to the proper anchor went a little left at the top, not right.  Perhaps, the route description could be clarified a bit.
    Aug 24, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    An interesting route with an exciting crux.  The traverse right under the roof is committing and airy.  I found the clip over the roof to be a bit pumpy, with OK but not great handholds.  Move a little left to reach a good high hold after the clip.  Above, angle right to do the standard finish to an anchor shared with Arcanum.  It's also possible to move left and finish on Mind Bender, as we saw done by another party.    I counted 9 bolts on the pitch, which is about 95' long.  You can belay from a small stance at the anchor if you want to do the second pitch of Arcanum (5.8 to 5.9) to the top of the rock, or lower with a 60m rope back to the start.  If you do the Arcanum finish, bring a red Alien to protect the move to the second bolt, and bring a wired nut to thread the top bolt which is missing a hanger.    Sleeping Beauty has a neat summit with great views; you should make it up there at least once on your trips to this crag.

    OK climb, but 1 or 1 1/2 stars rather than 3, when compared to other climbs at Sleeping Beauty. The start (Kama Sutra) is good, the moves right are fun but short, with a difficult gaston foot switch, then much moderate nondescript climbing that shares a short bit with Kama Sutra, then good hard 9 climbing on the upper part of Wings of Desire. I.e., about 6 traversing feet of good new climbing.    The description says you come "very near" to Kama Sutra up high, but I actually joined Kama Sutra for about 15' on the lead. On TR, I was able to avoid the KS crack, but only by inches. That seemed silly, grungy, and would be dangerous on the lead.    The bolt is somewhat useful, but not much--I didn't clip it. Since I was self-belaying, and rope drag was not an issue, I placed a #3 Camalot at the base of the wide crack on KS, stepped down and across. Soon as you get the good stem you get good gear. On a regular lead, you could do the same thing with a long sling on the left and back cleaning the first piece you place after the traverse. Or you could use double ropes.    As for difficulty, maybe 10a by Sleeping Beauty standards (Crack of Dawn is harder), but there are harder 9s in Eldo and Boulder Canyon. I had more difficulty with bolted upper Wings of Desire than with the trad bottom 2/3's. I'm revising downward my estimate of the difficulty of the Kama Sutra start. The main difficult is getting jams with the cams in the way. Otherwise, it's very straightforward.    For gear, I carried way too much in the 1" size as per the description. It's not really a finger crack. Singles from finger size up. Doubles in hand-sized (since you'll be leaving a couple at the initial roof). Brass if you plan to avoid the upper part of KS (silly). #3 Camalot if you plan on skipping the bolt (less silly). Plus a set of nuts, mostly big for the several great nut placements.

As Ivan mentions, there are no rap rings on the top anchor, so don't belay here but continue on to the Immaculate Deception anchor.This anchor is hard to see; don't go too far right before heading up.

    I was up there about a month ago, and checked out the start of The Wave after doing Mystic Mile.  I clipped the first few bolts, got to the overhanging headwall, and couldn't figure out how to move up, so I backed off.  The dihedral to the right is also quite difficult; I backed off that as well. This route is much harder than the 10a listed on Rossiter's website.  I have a hand-drawn topo that Rossiter did a few years ago, and it shows an A0 move on the headwall.

    Fun with several hard moves -- mostly high steps -- betwen the 7th bolt and the anchors. Less fun but more exciting if: (1) you get suckered into climbing straight up at the 5th bolt and, after falling off the crux of MLK twice, realize you're off route and have to downclimb to the 5th bolt to continue; and (2) only have one 60m rope and have to rap 40' to the MLK anchors and then 100' to the ledge in a torrential rain and hail storm.

    Did this route yesterday with Joe Chorny.  The upper crux is between the 6th and 7th bolts and is a little spicy as you make the hardest move with the bolt 2-3 ft below your feet.

    At the crux bulge there is a big flake about 2 feet right of the main crack.  If you use this flake for your right hand, rather than jamming both hands in the crack, you can stem right past the bulge at about 5.8 (maybe even 5.7+) because you can make better use of the good left foot holds in the crack which you can't seem to use properly if you are straight in jamming the crack.

Bring a single set of nuts and a single set of cams. The nut placements are excellent."    Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.  I didn't place any nuts, but did place several tricams, several Aliens, two #1 and two #2 Camalots, and a #3 Camalot.

    The route has cleaned up nicely since last fall; solid climbing from start to finish.    From the anchor, you can rappel back to the start with a 70m rope,with about 5 feet of rope to spare.

    I also agree that this is an excellent route. It looks dirty but climbs clean. Jamming and stemming at about 5.8 lead to the roof. A couple of crux moves pass the roof, and then an insecure move gets you into slab climbing when the crack runs out. I didn't think the pro was scarce at that point. I had a good but shallow medium sized cam. The slab is pretty easy, and you can climb it left of the Black Rain bolts if you want to climb a slightly separate line. This is a good climb on which to practice nut craft. Bring a single set of nuts and a single set of cams. The nut placements are excellent.

    A fun route with a variety of moves: stemming, hand jamming, a roof, and a slabby face.  Too bad the route is still quite dirty and mossy in spots (see photo).  Two stars for the moves, but downgraded to  one star because of the uncleaned rock.    The rappel route runs through the middle of four small trees; pull the ropes carefully to avoid a snag.    Nice moves, but dirty rock.

    Got to say I really like this route. It really overhangs. The 5.12a/b rating was given because there are two ways to go about this climb. It is possible to get an off route rest to the left &amp; clip the 4th bolt. Then, you are forced to climb back right to rejoin the line. This is the 12a version. It has the same crux moves, but the rest makes it easier. Having the 4th bolt already clipped makes it psychologically easier.    The cool way (.12b) is the direct version. The crux moves are done above the 3rd bolt. I have to get my left hand on a good lieback edge above the 4th bolt before I can clip it. The obvious, direct version makes for a sustained, short route.

    Wow that's quite a downgrade.  I was very "tired" when I did it (on a top rope) and thought it was easy for 11a, but 10a doesn't quite right either.  Felt a couple notches harder that the 10c (Waves of Rays), so maybe WOR is 5.9?  That's possible.  Anyway, these routes are OK, nothing special and not worth the hike from a pure climbing perspective, but possibly worthwhile for the scenery.

    The 11a rating is what is given in the book. I think this line is perhaps a number grade easier than that. If you're a 5.10 leader, as I am on a good day, you will feel comfortable on this one.

    Some of the clips required a bit of a reach. Might not be the best for a shorter person not confident at the grade. I (5'8") was able to clip pretty confidently, but my friend (5'6") struggled a bit more. Also, be careful when your pulling your rope. There are so many ledges to catch the rope on. I got it caught and had to clip up three bolts of p2 and do the some what sketchy downclimb off the big ledge. If nothing else, you should do this route for the beautiful views. Some of the best belay stations I've been too.

    The nut and hanger on the sixth bolt, which protects the crux on pitch two, are loose. Bring a wrench for a large-size nut. BTW that bolt is poorly placed, so that the hanger can't rest flush against the rock. BTW I found no good trad placement near the crux.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route falls into the grey area of what should or should not be bolted.  After leading it last night without clipping any of the bolts, I found it to be significantly better and more engaging when done trad and as a single pitch.   Why I say that this is a 'grey area' climb is that there are some runouts or difficult areas to place gear. A beginner at this level should not attempt the lead. An experienced leader should be OK.  Take a set of cams from .3" to 2.5" and a set of nuts and a significant number of slings, since the pitch is long and wanders a little.  The stars, difficulty, and protection grade I give here are accounting for doing it trad.
    Aug 30, 2006

    I thought this was a great route, and definitely worth the visit.  The first pitch felt a little harder than 5.7 at the third bolt.  You can't see the P1 anchors until you are past the fourth bolt and pull up onto the ledge.  The second pitch was a lot of fun - great climbing throughout on great rock.  The crux comes early at the second bolt, followed by a fun transition from face to slab just below the anchors.  The anchors are in a great position with good views up the canyon.  Definitely recommended.

    Watch out for loose rock on this one.  If you look at the beta photo for the first pitch, there is a pretty well-defined block just below the second bolt.

    Excellent route with varied moves - loved it! The crux is tricky for a 5.9 but definitely doable. Want my beta to avoid aiding it? After you turn the huge roof and stand up to clip the next bolt, drop back down about a foot to stay low on good hands and feet and traverse back toward the right edge of the face. There's a high right-hand pinch on the face that should be within reach unless you're quite short. It's not much, but it's solid. There's also a mini-ledge just under the face itself near the arete - get your feet on this, pull on the right-hand pinch, and stand up calmly. Decent left-hand holds will be in reach. I'm 5'7" and wimpy, and this move wasn't reachy or pumpy or too thin for me. The rest of the route similarly has good hands and feet if you look for them and have decent technique. Use a few long slings to reduce rope drag if you've got them.

    Dale Haas and I addressed the problems with the 4th bolt on this route.  We added a SS lock washer and applied some silicone seal to the threads, so this bolt should stay tight for a while.  We also tightened most of the other bolts on the route.

    Fun problem, great views, worth the extra hike from Avalon to do.   Upgrading a bit due to the crux, which felt hard for a 5.9 (even for Boulder Canyon).
    Jul 28, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    One of the best 5.9s IMHO. I got around the roof by crouching low standing on the ledge on the face of the arete(?) and sidepulling on both sides then just inching around. The crux is committing, but there is small micro-ledge above the cave right of the jug that you can get your foot up on to. In conjunction with the pinch, it's doable. Be warned, the next few clipping stances aren't great and might really tax a nervous leader.

    Crux bolt nut (the first bolt after the roof) is still loose - I hand-tightened it today.
    Jul 24, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Excellent route. Sustained climbing at the grade. I'm not sure how it was before a hold at the crux reportedly broke off, but I would say it goes at 5.9, sustained with some moves over exposure. I too found the bolt next to the crux to be loose 7/2/14. Solid bolt, the nut on it is just loose. Didn't have a tool otherwise I'd have tightened it more than just by hand. It's probably the bolt most likely to get torqued on the route due to being at the crux, so check it out before you clip it. Have fun!

    I tried to rope solo Luminosity today, and I am clueless at the crux so ended up doing it 5.8 A0.  For the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to move my hands to lean over to the jug?  Is the move height dependant or was I just off today?  I think the Avalon/Solaris area is some of the softest grades in the canyon, and this felt way harder than say Dominator, Mists of Avalon, The Tower, or Wheel of Fortune.  Or like I say I was off and missing something.  Have to go back w/ a partner.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    NOTICE:  As of 9/7/13, the 4th bolt (I believe) above the roof and at the crux is loose.  Still a great route!  Definitely a stiff 9 without the broken off hold...maybe 10a?
    Sep 7, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Terrific, long route with great positions on very steep rock and spectacular views at the top. Sustained 5.8/5.9 with a 5.10a crux above the roof.
    Aug 30, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I lead this yesterday, having never climbed it before. It's well protected, but I would grade it at 9+, only for the crux. Someone mentioned the sidepull being gone, which makes it much more balancy to get your feet above the roof. The next couple moves are tricky as well, which makes the sequence harder than 9 in my opinion.    For reference, I've lead In Memory of Trees twice, and feel Luminosity is more difficult. Not quite 10a, but sustained 8+, with a 9+ crux. The diagonal crack before the anchors is excellent.

    One of the best 5.9 sport routes in Boulder Canyon!  Turning the roof and next few face moves are the crux.  The flake at the top is my favorite section.
    May 17, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Yeah, when I climbed it today, I was confused about the sequence above the roof.  Having climbed it before, I remembered a nice hold to get your feet over to the right and eventually up.  Without the hold, it's definitely harder- perhaps 10a.
    Mar 25, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    During early September, I pulled off a hunk of rock about the size of a book at the crux. So... it's a little harder now.     To pass the crux, there was this sidepull off to your right. Yeah, it's not there anymore.     Good luck. It's still a blast of a route.
    Nov 1, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Nicely varied climbing (backstep, layback, you can even fingerjam if you really want) on positive holds the whole way.    Recommend using a double-runner on the bolt inside the dihedral; this will help with rope drag a bit later, but it's manageable without.    5.9?  It's a "boulder canyon 5.9" which means it's more like 5.8.  Whatever.  5.youcan or 5.youcan't.
    Jul 8, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a fun route with big, positive hand holds for the entire thing.  It is a sequence of interesting moves shifting your weight around.  I would say there isn't a single move harder than 5.8, but it is sustained throughout.

    Don't pass this one up! Excellent route that will clean up in time.  Recommend that the belayer be wearing a helmet and glasses as there is an occasional lichen shower and/or pebble size rock.  There are also some fist size rocks waiting to be pulled out as well.  50M rope just gets you down.  Don't forget your knots in the ends though!

    I thought this was another great route on Solaris.  Fun, sustained climbing to the anchors, with great position.  The final moves up the arcing hand crack just below the anchors are great.  I would agree with Ron - the best route on Solaris, and worth going back to.
    Aug 7, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Maybe 5.9 by Boulder Canyon sport standards, but there are much harder 9s. The fun move is the move left at the roof--squatting there trying to figure out what to do with your head. The moves up and right above the roof are  also tricky. I wanted to go right just above the lip...

    The crux is at the top, right at the last bolt.  There is a slopy, sidepull thing (that is the only way I can describe it) you have to use to work your way up to establish yourself at the anchor.  I couldn't reach the anchor from the stance below the roof, so I had to make the moves, that is where the 5.10 is I would say.  The route is ok, worth doing once for sure.
    Aug 16, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The crux is certainly at the top and maybe the very bottom if you don't touch the tree.  I think the climb is mostly 5.8 and you could use all gear, but the bolts are nice and reassuring to clip.
    Jul 29, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I know I'm on an told topic of dispute; however, this route feels like the 5.10 move is right at the top just under the anchor and can actually be skipped if you stretch a little (I'm short FYI) and clip the anchor. Otherwise a somewhat fun if awkward climb.     I'm easily amused though, so your milage may vary.
    Nov 8, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Perhaps it's because I am only getting into trad, but this definitely felt 5.10 to me.  With comparing the other routes in the area, especially Tower of Power, there were two moves on this (the lieback and pulling right with a high foot above the anchor) that felt easily as hard if not harder than any move on Tower of Power.  Fun climb and agree that this could have been protected with a little runout and skipping all of the bolts.  I certainly appreciate those anchors though!
    Jun 17, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    For pro:  I place 2 small nuts (somewhere in the #3-#7 range) and then protected the last move before the first bolt with a 0.4 BD cam.  I tried to not touch the tree, but it was pretty unnatural to not lean out when placing the first piece of gear.  If the tree weren't there it wouldn't be much harder, but it is a bit contrived to find some body position that doesn't touch it...    I would say the last move to get to the first bolt was the hardest move before the roof, and was comparable to 5.9s in the area (similar to the crux move on Luminosity for difficulty)    Once you get to the bolts the climbing eases off until you clip the anchor.  Once you clip the anchor, pulling the roof seemed harder than any move on the neighboring 5.10bs to the left (Tower of Power or Twilight Zone)  Obviously, you are already into the anchors so you can just pull yourself up... but there are a couple of decent foot holds to establish yourself on and once you pull the roof, there are good handholds above the anchor, so pulling on the anchors isn't necessary.

Do you think the two-bolt anchor at the top should also be removed, to make this a "pure" trad route?  How many ascents do you think the route would see if if it had no bolts at all?  My guess: not many. The move turning the roof is pretty hard, and poorly protected without the last lead protection bolt or the bolt anchor to clip.

    Oct 3, 2007

    I cleaned the loose stuff from the crack and it goes all trad, at least to the anchors, without any runouts. Gear- cams to 3" and larger stoppers or small tricams.  You can pull up over the roof, but it is difficult- clip the anchor for that move.
    Oct 3, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I wasn't trying to get heavy... But when you're trying to assess the correctness of a climb's rating, you need to consider how it is usually done. This is more the case with sport climbs where it's often easiear to climb just a few feet to one side or the other. (With trad it's almost always considered fair to use nearby features.) So, when rating a climb, there are some "rules" that need to be considered. Ditto for rating boulder problems.

    Ivan,    You need not ask anyone about what constitutes the end of a climb, success or failure but yourself.  In the big picture, What The *#@% Does It Matter (WTFDIM)?  The beauty (and sometimes scourge) of this game is that we all play by our own rules, more or less.  (The exception is when our rules change the rules or experience for others, e.g. bolting, chipping, etc.  I won't tread any further on this slippery slope.)  Anarchy is the cornerstone of climbing.  Seeking affirmation from others is anathema to the game and its' primary rule (anarchy), thus depriving yourself of an experience that you define on your terms.

    William,    I thought I was clear. I clipped the anchor bolts clean, and then pulled on those draws to get high enough to thread the rings. Clipping the anchor bolts was about 5.9. Below that the climbing felt like 5.8. Often, people grab the anchor draws, because there is no good stance at the anchors, and that's my question on Mission to Mars: Is the climb over when you clip the anchor, or are you supposed to continue and actually pull over the hang? If your chest is at, say, the level of the anchor, there would be no decent stance.    Ivan

    Ivan, I'm confused... You've established yourself on this site by posting comments on 5.9+ well into the 5.11 range and yet, this easy 5.8 necessitates you "yarding on the draws?" I'm not calling you out by any means, just seeking clarification. What do you mean by "yarding on the 'draws?" French-Freeing a route, or something else? If FF-ing the route is what you meant, was it the darkness or difficulty that affected your ascent style?  I think it's just me having stayed up WAY too late reading this cursed site in my insomnia. Cheers!~Wm
    Oct 29, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The climbing up to the roof is, in my opinion, 5.8. If this is the crux, and is considered 10a,  then the sport standards are really slipping. There are 5.8s that are way harder than this.    As for the last move, clipping the anchors is strenuous, but are you supposed to get established above the roof, or do you just yard on the draws (as I did)? I tried several times to pull over the lip to get established on the holds by the anchors, but  couldn't get it. I was in a bit of a panic, because it was getting dark, so maybe I missed something.    If you're supposed to pull over the lip rather than yard on the draws, this might be real 10c or so. On the other hand, if you're just supposed to clip the anchors and yard on the draws, then this is silly. Just put the anchors under the roof.
    Oct 29, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'm happy that the first ascensionists left the crack unbolted -- a few small cams protect that section quite nicely.  There's a fair amount of pigeon "grease" around the third bolt, so beware.      The moves just getting to the anchor felt rather awkward to me.

    Height-dependent - at the 3rd bolt if you can not reach the good edge you'd have to make a funky lay-back. If you can reach, it's quite easy. (6'0" would be easy, or shorter with long arms).  The real question here is about the bolts.  WTF?  Let's see, perfect green Camalot, stopper, stopper, .75" cam, stopper, ledge with whatever, tree.  That got me 20 feet up past the first 3 bolts. All placements were bomber and I put them 4' apart for effect.

    I thought this was the most fun climb in this lower section. The dihedral is FAR cleaner that one would expect. If you start below the dihedral to the right-ish (the obvious line all the way up), be VERY careful on the flake to the climber's right before you get to the ledge. It's about 5-6' tall and about 4' deep at the top, and it almost came completely out when I pulled on it at the very top. Be careful with that one as the climbing is easy on solid rock to that point.     Note: this whole bottom section is rated pretty soft.

    Most of the first pitch has quite the classic alpine feel (discontinuous, loose, 4th/5th class, lichen-y). The second pitch is on much more solid rock and super-cool, and is one of those pitches you wish was at least twice as long. Its beginning is quite run-out, though it's possible to clip the first bolt of Cosmic Explorer and traverse back into the crack from there at 9+ or so. Rapped C.E., after debating the existence of a walk-off. Apparently, according to previous post, that will work.

    The start of the 5.9 section is not completely unprotectable.  I think it is unnecessary to clip a bolt on Cosmic Explorer.  If you can climb 5.9s, you make a move or two before you get good gear, but it is doable without too much risk.

    I'm not sure where A Concerned Citizen was, but there are no bolts on this route.  We did it this way: one short 30' pitch of hand cracks to a ledge with a tree (5.7ish).  The second pitch begins at this broad 15' ledge.  A few flaring cracks lead up on balancy moves with somewhat tricky but adequate gear.  I saw the anchors to the right on Cosmic Explorer, but headed to the top of the formation via an offwidth and walked off the back.  We headed to the next gully over after you top out to walk down.  Decent route, a bit dirty but given the location that might be expected.  Still fun, though.

    Protects well on a single set of cams to 3" plus nuts. The climb is great moves on good rock, but it would be better if not broken up by a ledge. Total length is ~105' and it can be rapped to the ground from the anchors to the right on Cosmic Explorer with a 70M rope.

    I  wondered why Rossiter said, "Hint: stay in line with the bolts above the roof." There are some bigger holds out left, but they don't work so well, If you're right at the bolts at the crux move, there's a ladder of small but positive foot holds, that makes it quite easy.

    Still shedding/crumbly.  Good climbing on poorly cleaned rock-  might get better with time.  Hard to on-sight, as above the roof is a semi-blind balance move, but not hard once you know what to do. Bolt just above the roof is placed awkwardly for the rope if you go up and fall on that, which is the crux.  Maybe a long draw (10-12" and beefy) would be best so you don't cut your rope or sling on the flake as your taut rope slices across it.

    Did it again today.  New nemesis.  Didn't use the left flake holds at all, tried going directly up the bolt line - definitely not 10a/b, at least c.  Some holds are now polished and more difficult to use.   Going to the right does work, but takes you off the bolt line.    Really wondering what the intended route was!   I'll keep coming back until my skills allow me to climb straight up the bolt line - totally doable, just not at my skill level yet.   Not that I think this is a particularly good route overall.   Really interested to try the 10c to the right, it looks fun.

    Climbing up the face didn't seem 5.10a/b, I used a bunch of the flake on the left.  Very fun that way, it will feel difficult if you are strong on the laybacks.  My partner said that his legs were worn out from hanging on the flake and sliding up the wall.

    Good route. I think the crux move was a little tougher than Rubber Chicken. Interesting holds, nice rock. I moved slightly left of the bolts to step up onto the ledge above the crux. Seems like if I was to the right I would have been on the other route.

Lots of nice, satisfying holds on this climb.

    I love this route as a good warm up for the chicken wall. It has also been useful as a spot to teach others some leading skills. It seems more like a 5.8 than a 5.9, but it really depends on your route. Don't drift too far from the bolt line!

    I'm with Dr. Evil on this one. Sharp! But overall fun with a crux around bolts 2 - 4.     Also, I made the crux moves before (attempting to) clip bolt 3, and got to the first good hold up and left of the third bolt. I was clipping from roughly waist height when I slipped and took a totally clean fall. (And I outweighed by belayer by about 70 lbs.) I think if you fell trying to clip the third bolt from the lower, worse holds, you might not take such a clean fall.

    Climbing on first half is OK, but bolts are placed to the right which makes route finding less obvious. The second half is contrived and poorly bolted.  An attentive belayer is necessary to avoid a ledge fall on the upper half; 2 ways to pull the roof - I thought the right option better.

    Wow! I never thought I'd see the direct start be rated 5.11 or even .11d. Are you sure you were on the correct route? Leave It To Beaver has a high 1st bolt that must be climbed up to from the left, above the starting ledge. This is followed by a hand traverse right past 2nd bolt to reach a small, left-facing corner. Beaver Fever is the 3 bolt direct start just right of Leave It To Beaver &amp; just left of Mutant Overload (the black streak). It can either be done to start Leave It To Beaver or Mutant Overload. The line Beaver Fever is the 5.12 direct start to the former, but it can be done to make the latter harder for a 12d/13a called Beaver Overload. I usually preclip the 2nd bolt to avoid a ledgefall. There is a jug hueco to start then to poor sloping small edge &amp; a small undercling flake to match on, &amp; then reach to a good jug pocket. At 3rd bolt, the climb moves up left into the corner. One of hardest moves on the Clock Tower with the exception of Salad Shooter. I can't always do it especially when it's warm. Perhaps it is easier for shorter climbers. To say that The Joker at Easter Rock is harder is a joke. I've warmed up on The Joker many times. It's a hard warm-up &amp; certainly has strange, funky moves but nothing as hard as the show stopper Beaver Fever. I first tried this start in 1999. I finally did it in Fall 2001. That was a good year. I had finally redpointed Buddha Belly, then Pump Truck, to mention a couple of the nearly 100 climbs of .12a or harder I sent that year. I redpointed Beaver Overload in 2006, then did Ten Digit Dialing (.12c) in Clear Creek. In 2007, I repeated many hard routes including Ten Digit &amp; Mutant Overload &amp; also did the first redpoint of War On Freedom (.13a/b) at Plotinus Wall but failed to repeat Beaver Fever. To answer the Anonymous Coward, it has been a very long time since I climbed Surreal Estate at Shelf Road, but it seemed harder than any single move on that route.
    Jul 19, 2015

    Four weeks out from hand surgery! Yeah it's no 12c, but it probably adds a letter grade to the difficulty of the route overall.  5.11d would be a good grade for this route anywhere.
    Oct 17, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I think there are 2 variations to this climb. The one that goes out left is pretty easy. Then there's one that is directly under the bolts, I had to use a sloper and lay back to swing to a big jug. This was the hardest part of the climb. Hardest climbing I have done. I give it a 12a/b and 4 stars (my style of climbing).
    Jul 13, 2010

    I also don't believe the people who rated this 5.11 were on route.  The first bolt on Leave it to Beaver is a bit right of the easiest line and might look like a direct start.

    Softest graded climb I've done in BoCan.  The "12c" part isn't even as hard as the upper part, which is the 11d crux of Leave it to Beaver.  Decent route, nonetheless.

    I believe that 11a might be a little sandbagged for sport climbing in Boulder Canyon.  I have not climbed any of the routes you mentioned above, but the day I did the route, my wife and a friend also did the route.  My wife, Michelle, has never climbed a 5.11c, let alone 12c.  She fell once, and that was past the crux.  My friend, Ryan, did not fall at all, and at the time he had to make 12a projects.  We all thought this route was 5.11.  I thought it was about the same grade as The Joker at Easter Rock, which I had done the week before I did Beaver Fever.  As with any rating, peoples opionion will be different, and it should not be left up to one person.  Maybe other people will put in thier two cents and we can get a consensus.  I am not trying to sandbag, but it might come naturally.
    Aug 21, 2002

    There seems to be a dispute here to how hard this route is: 12c vs. 11a.  Quite a difference.  Is one person trying to sandbag or is the other person looking for an ego stroke.  So, how hard does this route feel?  Is it similar in difficulty to 12c's such as Rifle's "Pretty Hate Machine", or Shelf Road's "Surreal Estate", or Boulder Canyon's "Gyro Captain".  The first ascentionists put a grade on the route.  Doesn't mean you can't disagree with them.  They may even disagree with themselves if they did the route again.

    Let's be real about the grade. Calling this .10a is just plain ridiculous. I have felt this climb could be rated .10d, &amp; in areas where overhanging 5.10 is the norm, it probably would be. That said, I've watched many climbers struggle &amp; hang going past 4th bolt up the short, left-facing crack corner. This lieback, fingerlock section is a real crux with overhanging moves leading up to it. There aren't many other continuously overhung 5.10 sport routes in Boulder Canyon. I have always felt that sticking to Big Dipper's original rating of 5.11a was wise. If you rate it 5.10 or 5.10d, all the more climbers will get on it &amp; flail.

    I've been on routes graded mid-5.10 that are harder than Tagger, Outer Space, and Grandmother's Challenge. So, that makes Tagger, Outer Space and Grandmother's Challenge 10- or perhaps 5.9, which means Big Dipper is 5.9 or 5.8 (this is clearly nonsense)..........      The point:  it's difficult to compare trad grades to sport grades.  Furthermore, it's hard to compare grades from one climbing area with grades of another climbing area.  How about we compare the grade for a climb in one are with other climbs in the SAME area. (i.e., compare Big Dipper to other climbs in Boulder Canyon).

    Richard,  Long time no see. I hope all is going well.    There is no point in changing what you wrote if that's your opinion and you own it and you're not beholden to anyone to change it.

My ongoing discussion here has never been to attempt to get everyone on a single grade or page, it was to defend that the multiple voices are valid, and that no single voice or opinion should or can dictate the opinion of others. I defend my interpretation of the route but don't expect others to necessarily share it.

Does Tony B and his other cast of middle-aged weaklings need to be reminded that there is nothing cutting edge about this grade range? What is their motive to downgrade? To remind the gym rat with six months experience that they haven't scratched the surface of advanced climbing? If you find yourself downgrading 12- routes, you probably need to take up another sport, because you just don't matter anymore!

    TB - yhe ape index does help to soften the move. I think the 5.12 rating was noted in Rolofson's guide, and I used that as a reference. Personally, I don't think the move is 5.10. Mid to upper 11 probably fits.

    I'm going to take a LOT of heat for this, but it is my honest opinion. This climb is VERY severely overgraded. It's fun but very overgraded. Maybe something broke off and left better holds, maybe it just suited my style, maybe I had the best day of my climbing career, but 5.12a/b should not be a cake walk for me - it should be on par with my most desperate on-sights ever. It wasn't. I'd put it on par with a soft 5.11 or hard 5.10. That said, big moves to big holds. I have very long arms and big shoulders. It you are 6' (I'm 5'10" with a +6" ape index) this should go well.    Really fun move. Please tell me that the opening undercling was real?!?!? It looked and felt drilled to me!    I honestly thought it was 5.10d. I thought about putting 11a/b, because that would stir the pot too much, but my honest opinion is my honest opinion and I don't want to mince that too much.

    I am not so tall at 5'9"... But this isn't even height dependent. This is a good 11d route for someone of my size, but the people that are 5'2" aren't going to be doing the same move as those over 6', not that they usually can on reachy routes. I don't think this was a chipped route, and was a fairly interesting and burney route for me.

    I couldn't detect any chipped holds and the bolts are some of the better spaced at the Sport Park. I'm tall so the reach was easy, so in my book it is 11c and gets *** Cory

    One of my favorite routes at Sport Park. This gives Butt Lucious an interesting direct finish. I skip the next to last bolt in the middle of the crux. It takes more energy to clip it than it's worth, considering it is a clean fall. It is a nice dog bolt to work the moves. Some people do clip it. Great moves &amp; not with big holds.

    I believe I was the person that introduced Kaelen Williams to this crag &amp; this route. I feel I should defend this climb &amp; critique this post. First, calling these manufactured holds ugly is a matter of opinion &amp; one I don't share. This climb is a masterpiece with big moves &amp; fun holds to climb on. The large hueco in the ceiling looks natural. As for this route &amp; others at the Clock Tower that have some manufactured holds, I have enjoyed many days of great training here. Where I don't usually advocate such tactics as the liberal use of chipping or manufacturing holds, this crag was a pile covered black shit below the blank overhangs. Chris &amp; Rick turned this crag into a wonderful sport crag. The tactics used here aren't appropriate at most crags or routes, but in a free society, there is room enough for such climbs to exist just like we have different religions, political views, &amp; porn.   As for the crux getting over the lip, the direct line is the intended line done by the first ascentionist. These funky moves are on natural holds. I have only redpointed the climb once this way &amp; normally take the indirect line. As for the grade, the direct line is .12c/d versus the indirect line is .12b. The direct line may be easier if you are short, but the dynos getting to here won't be. The indirect line at the lip, moves left to Jolly Jug for a final dyno &amp; then steps back right onto Hair Shirt, using all the same bolts. Where I do use a few holds on Jolly Jug, it is not the same moves as on that route as I am further right.

    This route was originally rated .11d not 5.12a &amp; it is not the leftmost bolt line.  The leftmost route, called "Ditch Witch" is rated .12a or .12b.  Ditch Witch shares the 1st bolt &amp; then climbs the leftmost bolt line.  It is essentially Hee Haw revisited with a separate finish to higher anchor, unless you climb the upper part of the route to the left of the bolts (.12b).  Chris Alber climbed it on the left.  Squeezed &amp; contrived.     As for Hee Haw, it is the second route from the left.  I'm sticking to the .11d rating.  There is big reach move or dyno off an undercling past the 4th bolt.  Then past the 5th bolt, is another move off an undercling with poor feet to make a final reach.     A harder climb than "Animal Magnetism" or its neighbor "Leave It To Beaver" in my opinion.

    Not that I'd bring a rack up to Sport Park, but this could easily and safely be led on gear. You could get a piece in up high before pulling the crux move or two.

    Most of climbing is 5.11 &amp; easier. The crux at the lip of the overhang is pretty aggro.  I used to have an much easier time repeating Go Dog Go, No Doze, or Hair Shirt (indirect variation) than repeating Jolly Jug. Inflation on the New Economy Cliff in Clear Creek has a huge dyno, &amp; I find it easier to send than Jolly Jug.  There is more than one way to do the crux. The dyno method is how I've always done it. There is a good hueco jug to dyno off to a horizontal slot. There is an intermediate pebble. If you over shoot the slot, you will most likely not catch it &amp; fall off.

    If you can look past the bat droppings all over the ground, bat shit all over the start of the route, and blatantly manufactured holds, it's actually quite enjoyable climbing. Pulling the roof move is pretty burly and powerful, especially for the super soft Sport Park Grades. 5.12s at the Sport Park are really 5.10, but this route packs a punch at the roof and is surprisingly pumpy. I'm not gonna lie, I did have fun on this route.... The only way I'm ever gonna climb on it again is to powerwash the whole first half.

    The first bolt is the high bolt left of the Beaver Fever. This route was established before Hee Haw. Clip the 1st bolt after pulling up on a jug to the left.  Climb up to the left side of a small shelf or "broad horizontal". Hand traverse right on the shelf &amp; stretch up to clip the 2nd bolt. Move a bit more right, &amp; continue up the left-facing corner.    Hee Haw's 1st bolt is really too low &amp; too far left to protect the start. You would definitely clip Hee Haw's first 2 bolts &amp; then move right on the hand traverse.  Hee Haw's 2nd bolt is a bit higher than the 1st bolt on Leave It To Beaver, so this is the more protected way to start.

    Great pitch with a few manufactured holds. There are two ways to do the crux at 6th bolt. The more direct way using the undercling for the left hand then dynoing to the jug with the right has always felt quite hard (.12d). This is how I climbed it numerous times over the years. In 2012, I figured out I could traverse left another move to to big sidepull flake &amp; then reach the jug. The way is less obvious but easier to execute (.12c). Please note: the first 5.12 section past 3rd bolt has gotten a bit harder in 2016, due to a small foothold breaking.

    Jim Redo makes a good point.  Is someone really trying to make the case that  "No Doze" is as hard as Smith Rock's "Chain Reaction" (12c)?  Absolutely no way.      If you were to drop Rifle's "Pretty Hate Machine", VRG's "Mentor", or Cave Rock's "Fire in the Hole" (all classic sport climbs originally rated 12b) at some of the newer Boulder Canyon crags, it seems to me they would all be rated 12d or 13a.      I guess it comes down to the question of whether or not the old timers were just sandbagging, or whether grade inflation is a problem around these parts.      At any rate, there is value in trying to keep consistent ratings, and I appreciate knowing when people think a rating is out of line.It doesn't make the route any less fun (if you thought it was fun in the first place), so there is no need to get upset over the rating issue.

    We top roped this climb after leading Mother Goose and really enjoyed it. An onsight lead of this climb would be a bold and dangerous undertaking. The first crux is protected well enough, I guess, but Ben is right. Clipping that second bolt would raise the difficulty a letter grade. At the second 11 move, that bolt is really a stretch. Lauren has it right when she points out the out of reach bolts at both the second and third 11 sections. It looks like one has to climb halfway through the third crux before the clip can be made. That said, the steep upper wall had some really good moves similar to the crux moves on "The Other One". Our plan is to try the lead with quickdraws in place. In no way was this climb a waste of time. Even guys watching from the Big Dipper said it looked like fun. Just top rope it first.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I found the first two cruxes of the route very fun. They make the route well worth doing. I did find that the third bolt was a dangerous clip. Unless you're about 5'8" or taller, you can't clip from the stance on the ledge. A fall from that ledge would involve hitting the ledge then going headfirst/rolling off onto the deck. The third crux was somewhat frustrating as the clip was too high for me to get from the good ledge. The third crux is suitable for a colder, stickier day. I suggest adding a bolt between the 2nd and 3rd existing bolts or stick-clipping to the 3rd.

    That system was used in other areas and guides instead of letters, for as long as you and I have been climbing and longer.  In fact, it predates the use of letters in grades, as you should know after 43 years.  I.e. 5.9-, 5.9, 5.9+.  Or i.e. 12-, 12, 12+ instead of 12a,b,c,d....  It is less specific in that case, subdivided into 3 grades instead of 4.    On THIS SITE, 12- is between 12a and 12b, and 12+ is between 12c and 12d, more or less in line with how I use it. This site is what is relevant here. I don't generally see fit to subdivide the 5.12 grade, since I am an onsight climber with 5.12 as my very upper end, the difference between 12a and 12b might be tough for me to tell.    I rated it, for all whatever, to be 12a/b on your scale. Consensus is 12b/c.  WTF is the difference worth arguing about? A single letter grade? Or a letter grade and a half if you insist that it is absolutely 12c?    Do we have to discuss, in detail, every single grade we disagree on in the comments section?

    This pocket seems to be "natural". Not the usual slick texture that a manufactured hold inhererits. If Jessie is out there listening, is it a drilled pocket? The move can be done without it.

    Pretty fun climbing, despite the very, very, obvious, two finger drilled pocket at the beginning of the crux.  What can you say though, it's the sport Park.  Worth doing.

    A crucial hold broke after the third bolt. Now makes pulling up to the 4th significantly harder. I'd say this line is now 11d/12a.

    Gotta love having to make only 2 moves between each bolt.  This was my first 11 lead.  Does it still count if I fell/yelled take at every bolt but 2?  hehe.  Yes, I have no shame.  The fact that I led this climbs proves that there is no way that this is 11c!  Maybe 10d but not 11c.  My name is Tracy Roach and I USED the dyno-scar!  Fun climb.

    I was wavering between adding this as a chipped route or not and decided that it should be classified as such because it is at the Sport Park and several routes there are modified and I just wated to add my two cents worth that I think that is super lame. If the operators of this site want to change the route to "non-modified", I won't lose any sleep over it. After all compared to some off the routes up there the large dynamite scar seems subtle. My comment above should say "at least Ground Zero has no drilled pockets" I got the names mixed up. Many of the routes at this crag suffer from that awful fate. I do however commend the bolting efforts of many of the FA's at this crag. I was talking with someone recently at Little Eiger who was putting up a new route and he told me: "I'm putting the bolts really close together on this route for people like you. It looks like you could stroll up the route but it also looks like you could use a girlfriend (I was climbing with two dudes). Closely spaced bolts brings more ladies to the crags and thats something we all want to see."In this regard the sport park rules, I just wanted to say chipping SUCKS!!! With bolts so close why bring down the difficulty?By the way, I probably would have added Spinx Crack as a modified route. :)

    Weather or not it was actually "chipped", I still enjoyed this climb.  I didn't even use the dynamite scar to pull it off.  It has a couple of really good moves and a lot of it is crimpy.  I don't think that it is rated correctly.  This was one of my first 5.11s and I pulled it with relative ease, which surprised me quite a bit. Chipped or not, I'll climb this one again.
    Sep 4, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Actually, by the site standards, this is definitely not a chipped route.  The "fundamental principle", i.e. the quote in bold on the "This is a modified route" page clearly states that it is the intent of the climber who puts up or climbs the route that makes a route "modified".
    May 21, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'm not chastising anyone, that fact remains that it is  altered, not in it's natural state and therefore "Chipped"  by this sites standards. I think more of the routes at the  Sport Park should be on the black list however. At least Owl  on the Prowl has no drilled pockets!.....
    May 21, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is actually a good climb and to blacklist the route because it is on a dynamite scar seems questionable.  If the first accentionists modifies the route, that is one thing. But if someone has the insight to turn a scar on the landscape into somthing good, enjoyed by many, and without further damage, I don't think we should chastise them.

    There is more than one way to climb this route, so the difficulty ranges from 5.11b to 5.11d. The cool direct line stays on the face &amp; avoids the bat shit crack. One of the photos show the climber spanning from a jug to a edge on the face. This is an easier way to climb the direct line, if you have the wing span.

    A short, fun route.  A little beta: I used a right-shoulder scum on the first crack/dihedral that worked nicely.  Once you get past the third bolt, use the arete to your left.  A right toe hook to gain the jug at the top of this arete comes in handy.  The rest is jugs or slopers to the top.

    We're not living in 1980s anymore, George. If a route is mostly bolt protected, then it is usually best to make it entirely bolt protected. If a climb is mostly bolt protected but requires a piece of two of gear, it presents a danger unless the gear is at the start. Many climbers will assume it is entirely bolted until they are up on the route. Personally I prefer a sport route to mixed gear &amp; bolts route, unless half or more of the climb requires gear.    Ultimately, I believe the first ascentionist has the liberty of deciding how to establish a climb. Calling bolts unnecessary because you can place a cam, is a snobby old school opinion. Many routes have been led or free soloed without the bolts, but other climbers will still appreciate those bolts or find them needed.

I thought the start had a hard move at the top of the short arête to gain the slab at 4th bolt. The final overhang has interesting moves as well. I did not grab the chains as George did but climbed to where my hands were on top &amp; I could stand on a hold. Interesting that you found the slab dirty. I did wire brush this line.

    The bolts on this route were quite badly placed.  Had to clip the second one while in the middle of a jam and got my rope all twisted up.  The third bolt is useless.  By the time you can clip it, you're already standing on the ledge, and reaching the 4th bolt is no problem from that position.    Getting over the roof is the crux.

    I found this route to be fun despite the chipped holds.  The roof is interesting and a little pumpy.  The technical crux came after the roof when I tried to avoid using the possibly chipped pocket through the blank face (although the pocket is less obviously chipped than other holds higher on this route, maybe because spiders have inhabited it).  I was able to avoid using chipped holds the whole way up until the jug just below the anchors.  I did not know this was a chipped hold until I grabbed it.  I think it would be fun and challenging to try to finish this climb without using that hold.  It's a true bummer that someone chipped this climb, because it is pretty fun and obviously needed no modifications.

    I'd say 11a if you go directly over the roof, a little less if you move to the right, then hand traverse back left.  I don't think I've ever seen such perfect holds in granite.
    Aug 29, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If you are correct, Alan, and I don't doubt that you are, then the chipping/drilling really is more than foaming at the mouth. The upper pocket is clearly unnecessary - the jugs can be reached easily from the thin seam (was it chipped?). If the hand traverse over the roof has been chipped then that also seems unnecessary since it will go with a short dodge to the left. Now in the case we are talking about, the chipping/drilling entails hacking a line down to 10+ where all of the chipping/drilling was utterly unnecessary. If this riles the climbing community in general, then this is not surprising, and I will side with the principle of solving nature's problems as they come to us - clean as a whistle. Isn't that our job?

    The friction move at the crux (third bolt) was a lot harder than 5.7, I thought. One of my teammates is 6'4" with a +2 and had no trouble (he also leads 5.11c). I'm 5'8 with a -2 and really struggled. Maybe I'm just too scared of a leader? Maybe the move would have been easier for me on TR?

    I think this route is going to be really hard for folks shorter and with less reach than me. (5'6" +1 ape).    As for on/off, IMHO avoiding the two small crimps on the bolt line up to the terrible dish on the right and the undercling crimp on the left, using only feet on the face? makes an ascent pretty pointless.

    Question on what's on/off: does the intended line ignore the stemming possibilities off to the right, along with the pocket on the far right?

    Led KFT last Thurs. June 2nd on a perfect day. Loved it. Bolts are well located. The only real committing part is the move over the flake, which is solid. I thought it easier than the move at the same level on CTP. The upper half is a blast with good holds and elegant moves. Above the flake, I stepped left then up to a good stance. Had to make a long reach back right to clip the bolt for the crux move. High step back right onto a couple more good feet, then reach the lower horizontal crack. Hard finishing move, too. I say, if you stay within reach of the bolt line, you're on route. My partner thought I wandered a little too close to CTP, said the pure line was directly up the bolts. What do you guys think?

    Here is alternative short person beta for the crux at the top. Up the crack, reach right to an edge, bridge right foot to dish.

    Crux is very height-dependent. For reference, I'm 5'7" with 0 ape-index. I tried going straight up from the pocket like Mark Rolofson said, but it doesn't matter how high I smear, I'm about an inch or two away from the shallow seam right of the bolt line. If I use the finger crack on the left, I can't use the good finger lock higher up, I have to keep my hand lower in the right-most part of the crack, in order to get two pads on the very bottom of the shallow seam (I'm fully extended at this point with not an inch to spare). From there, it's a very chin-to-the-rock balancy move to transition from the left hand crack to the right hand seam. Anyone with less than my wingspan will not be able to reach the seam from the left finger crack and will have to work out some pretty hard beta (hand-foot match in the pocket, like mentioned above?).

    I agree with the above comment that Chris makes. If this route were in Eldo or a more "respectable" crag in BoCan, it would be 4-stars and highly sought after.

I'm glad I did, because my eye was immediately draw to this line, and I'm also a sucker for Grateful Dead references! So yes, say what you will about the sport park, but this is a quality line on BOMBER rock (aside from the first 10' maybe) with great climbing and a devious crux sequence. Wharf Factor down the hill is a great pitch as well.

    As the first ascentionist of this 100% natural line, the route goes straight up the face.  The crack on "PowerLine Pup" is off limits for making the moves even though I often use it to rest while standing on the horizontal break. Here is the beta.  Left hand goes in the shallow, large pocket. Right hand on a small edge.  Feet are on the good horizontal break to start.  Bring the right foot up to a good edge one foot above the break.  Left foot on a tiny edge.  Reach a fingertip lock in the bottom of a shallow seam. Sorry, shortie, this route is not for you.  Left foot goes up again onto a tiny edge that curves up left. Stand on this foot and bring the right foot into the shallow pocket on top of or right of your fingers.  Pull your fingers out of way and reach a good fingertip lieback.  Stand up and clip last bolt.  Finishing is easier with a moderate 5.11 move.  I have done this route many times and so has my first ascent partner, Chris Alber.  In fact, I do it about twice a year.  Often it is easy, but sometimes I can't do it and it is due to the shoes I am wearing.  The tiny left foothold requires a tight shoes with a square edge.  Sloppy shoes and worn out edges don't work.  The short climber method is to use the crack on "Powerline Pup" and move right.  It is still 5.12b, but it is definitely easier than the intended line.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Pretty silly that the chipping/overbolted discussion is going on for this particular route which is neither chipped, nor overbolted.    Since Chris asked for beta, here's mine:  Very technical.  At the 2nd to last bolt, right hand in the pod, left hand in the highest good fingerlock in the crack out left.  Stem left as high as possible and right hand/foot match in the pod.  Bring right hand up to slopey layaway near the seam (the best part has a tiny thumb catch).  Bring left hand up higher to a thin flaring part of the left crack, then bump left foot up higher.  At this point you are pretty stretched out.  Crank off the right layaway and pull your weight over your right foot and grab a thin crimp above your head with your left.  Move with the right to the good part of the seam and clip the last bolt.    For my length this felt like mid-12, but if you can't reach from the left crack this would be WAY harder, involving moving directly up from the pod to the seam with no feet.  Very height dependent, and one of those routes that it doesn't make sense to give a letter grade.

    I struggle to understand Nathan's comment, regarding if the 2nd bolt was lower it would avoid breaking an angle. First, the landing is quite good, and if you blew the 2nd clip, it is not far to the ground. By bouldering standards, it wouldn't be too bad unless you landed on your back or head. Still avoiding a groundfall is always wise. I ALWAYS STICK CLIP THE 2ND BOLT TO AVOID A GROUNDFALL. Lowering the bolt would make the clip marginally easier, while not protecting the moves over the lip as well. It may even make it harder to work the moves pulling over the lip too. The bolt could only be lowered about 6" or less. Putting it below the handhold or in the roof would likely be putting a bolt in a hollow flake.    Regarding the quickdraw blocking the handhold, it has never been a big problem because the good part of the diagonal hold its upper left side. This is at least a foot left of the quickdraw.    I have climbed this route many times since 2000. The start is a powerful roof problem. Taping the right hand helps for a flared hand jam in the flake in the roof.

    Would love to see that second bolt placed lower, so you don't break an ankle if you fall and also so you don't have the draw hanging right in the middle of the hold.

    I did not notice the drilled holds at the bottom the many years ago that I first did the route. One is in a natural foot placement, but I don't use the others. I think the one can be avoided with the foot, but it is lame that it exists at all.

    I really enjoyed this route. Making that first clip would be much less frightening if you had a bouldering pad. The moves never really seemed to get into the .12 range to me, but I haven't climbed much at the grade in Boulder Canyon, so it could just be a matter of [lack of] perspective.

    The guidebook suggestion to place a long draw on the second bolt is helpful.  Otherwise, make sure your belayer is right underneath you and paying attention.  Too bad I had to climb the miserable route to the left to set it up.

    Definitely one of the best climbs at Sport Park with lots of interesting climbing on great rock.  The roof is the unavoidable gymnastic crux, but it is far from over on the face above the lip.  The shallow seam &amp; vertical face above the roof is tricky &amp; can feel very insecure.  Above the 5th bolt the climbing eases of with relaxing rests on small ledges.  A 5.10 section moves right  &amp; up to great pocket in a horizontal break.  The upper crux  past the 8th bolt is quite tricky with poor smears &amp; should not be missed.  It can be avoided by moving left onto Space Goats &amp; then stepping back right. However, the upper crux is not contrived &amp; takes the direct independent line.  These crux moves begin with a short steep slab leading into a left-facing corner.

    This climb was led in 2001 by Alex Shainman without the bolts &amp; on sight. His partner also led the route on mostly gear but opted to clip the crux bolt. I can think of numerous routes that have been led on gear after being established with bolts. Usually these climbs will still be led with bolts by the majority of climbers.  It's fun to climb Mercy Drilling &amp; simply focus on the climbing, without having to fiddle with tricky gear to engineer a safety net.    Other serious, hard to protect climbs that were led entirely on gear were later bolted. Cookie Monster (pitch 1 - 5.12a) in Yosemite &amp; Jaws (5.11d) at the East Quarry come to mind.  Classic routes that get climbed thanks to the bolts.

    I led this on gear today, and the pro is actually very good. That being said, it was strenuous to place, and I had to top rope first to figure out some of the placements. It's a little finicky right before the crux. The crux itself is protected with a bomber small stopper. This route feels really cool as a trad line. PG-13 rating with the right gear beta.    I used lots of small cams from the tiniest gray C3 up to a #0.75 Camalot plus small to medium stoppers.    This gear info is just FYI for anyone who wants to do the pitch on gear, I certainly do not expect the bolts to get pulled because I rehearsed a gear ascent on top rope.    The pocket seems most definitely natural, and there are several other similar pockets on that face that aren't part of any route.
    Aug 29, 2016
</blockquote><blockquote>
    That pocket is natural, for sure. There are a lot of water pockets throughout Boulder Canyon that occur naturally, and this is one of them, at least from my experience climbing the route. You can tell because a natural pocket will still have a rough, crystalline texture.

    Those monos are all over the place. Mark has earned more respect than to be accused of manufacturing holds by people who probably don't even know him. I've known him for decades, and if he says he did not drill that pocket, I have no doubt in that he didn't. Accusing someone like Mark, without sufficient evidence and whose route-development résumé speaks for itself, is bad form.     If this bolted route isn't your style, there's always RP or Not to Be, in Eldo. It's barely 12a, and you should have no probably getting your pucker factor on.

    Maybe because it's a bolted crack? And I'm glad they were there; I wouldn't lead this thing on gear but had a great time clipping bolts and enjoyed the safe crack climbing. I also didn't find a mono on the upper section, just the two finger pocket in the middle.

    This is a really nice route. It's a little short, but it's quite fun.    I would agree with others that when I first looked at the pocket on this thing, I thought it was drilled (and yes, I frowned a little). However, then I started to look around more and there are indeed other solution pockets scattered here and there, and given that Mark has posted up, I think it's best to take him at as his word (thanks for posting, Mark). I think the route poster should consider amending the description.    Furthermore, about the gear... this thing would be deeply 'R' without the bolts. The placements are flaring and marginal at best. A fall at the crux would probably not be super pretty. On top of this, I think it's bad form to climb a route using the fixed gear and then comment on how a route "could" go on natural pro...and clearly the route poster has not climbed it this way, because if he had, he would have noticed that there is no 3 inch (or 2 inch for that matter) gear on this until you are at the anchor.
    Nov 8, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    To set the record straight on Mercy Drilling &amp; all the routes on the west face: all holds are natural. Perhaps the person who submitted this route should talked with Chris or me. In fact, the two finger undercling/sidepull pocket would have been very hard to drill like this. This is a beautiful examples of how natural pockets exist in granite. Most of the drilled holds I am aware of at the Sport Park are the larger pockets &amp; jugs. I have ignored much of this site, especially if I have climbed a certain route &amp; have the needed info. I generally just use it to get new route &amp; first ascent info, but I am tired of hearing about this pocket being manufactured. Lastly, if you don't like the bolts on this climb, either don't clip them or go climb Never A Dull Moment, Spin Off, &amp; Englishmen's Home at Castle Rock. Limits Of Power at Blob hasn't seem a repeat in probably over two decades.

    I'm glad this route was bolted, because I would never want to lead it trad, and I have led other routes at this crag with trad gear.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    When I first climbed this route several years ago, I thought it was chipped as well, but after climbing a few more routes on the cliff, I highly doubt the two solution pockets in the upper part of the route were chipped.  At the worst they might have been comfortized, but this section of Surprising Crag has several such pockets, nowhere near the cruxes of routes (you don't even have to use the crux "mono" mentioned above).    This would be an R/X-rated trad lead.  It would be an exciting, but relatively-safe mixed lead if one clips only the bolt at the crux.    People who are caught up in the Sport Park hysteria are missing out on a very nice crag in the west face of Surprising.  There  are several good 5.11-12 sport routes (not chipped) and some intimidating looking trad lines.
    Oct 11, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This mono is not man-made. Occasionally features like these are created when granite is formed and/or eroded. I've climbed this route and have looked for and have NOT found any signs of chipping. Look at the hueco on "American Beauty" next to this climb. It is NATURAL. I have seen these kinds of pockets on granite in many other areas, not chipped. Just because a route is at the Sport Park does not automatically mean that it is chipped or bad. There are some good routes up there.    This is a good route with one very bad jam in the crux.    I think that it would hard to protect the crux and the section above it getting to the good finger jam (where the difficulties let off). At this point your last piece would be below the horizontal seam that is before the crux. A fall here, on gear, would be interesting.

    Enjoyable, to say the least. After some beta, I found the moves weren't too outrageous. The crux is REALLY tricky if you don't know where that crimp is. I tried using the sloper to the right and felt like pulling my hair out. Sturdy holds, regardless of possible chipping.

    That other route to the left is Shakedown Street, 12.c, according to this source. The Other One is a quality climb in great position. We got some incredible shots in profile with massive, towering cumulus above and the colors of the rock really popping. I'll post as soon as I get my camera back. The crux moves took me some figuring out. Some guy who was free-soloing 8s tried to give me the beta, but I tuned him out. For what it's worth, a guy I saw flash some 11d to the left, one of the roof routes, had a harder time on this climb. I would concur that this is the best route on Surprising Slab.

Straight up "power crimping," wide feet on the overhanging wall and using the high sloper on the face got me nowhere.  (Neither did the sketchy slapping along the arete.)

    After getting rained/hailed on at Castle Rock on Sunday then walking up to the choss at Mountain Rose crag with threatening rain again, I and my partner decided to go walk up to sport park at dusk and check the place out &amp; see what all of the noise is about. We went with no guide, so we didn't know what routes we might try or what kind of chip &amp; glue we might see. In the fading light (this route being done on a cloudy night at 8:45PM on May 18, the sun having set 15-20 min ago) I wound up for this route.When I was done, I called it 5.10c. I am guessing, but the point is that the route is seriously over-graded.On the bright side, the holds were all natural (or at least what I could see in that light- without the chalk on them, they would have been exceptionally hard to find).  The crux was pulling over the round bulge onto slabby holds and I was relieved not to have found a deep finger pocket there- one which would have changed the climb totally.The line was reasonably bolted and due to it's position on the arete/end of the buttress was not seemingly crowded. If all of the lines at the Sport Park had been done in this fashion, nobody would bother bagging on the place for anything more than the blatant over-rating of the climbs.    5.10c in the dark.  This is not an exaggeration- it's how I did the route.

    It is what it is, a bolted crack. Consider the bolts a safety net for the aspiring trad leader. Same can be said for "The Touch". If you like 5.8s, do it. If you're offended by the bolts, I suggest leaving that beautiful matched set of quickdraws at home and choose a climb you can safely do with a set of hexes and stoppers. Bottom line is, bolts make climbing easier and safer, just like cams, shoes, or any of the newer technologies. Most of you climbing now wouldn't be if it wasn't for some of these advancements. Nobody gets into climbing with a death wish [I hope]. So, enjoy the rock in your own way, and try not to be to judgemental about the styles and ethics of certain areas. I had to laugh a few years back when I saw the article in some climbing magazine proclaiming Sport Park one of the ten worst crags in the U.S. What elitist crap!

    I thought that it was easier to use gear than the bolts, which are somewhat awkwardly placed on the face to the right of the route. I noticed the tendency for the rope to get caught in that little corner and just placed a redirect to keep it a couple of inches out.    Kind of a dull and unrewarding crack, but sufficed as a warmup for the west face. There was a huge group on the south face, so we just worked our way left to right.

    I just led this yesterday with cams and stoppers.  Must say that the bolts are probably easier to clip if you're not used to gear placement.  I had to place a #1 gold camalot in the crack while hanging off a jam on my left hand.  Kind of awkward since I'm used to waiting for good stances before I place anything.    The other problem is that placing gear in the crack runs the rope through an annoying slot where is gets stuck if you don't work really hard to keep it out.  I had to climb back up my rope to get it unstuck and remove the piece that was feeding it in to the slot.  The bolts avoid this problem by keeping the rope way out of the crack.

    A nice climb, but after having led it using the bolts, I wonder if it might even be easier just to go ahead and lead with trad gear. Just cause the bolts are there doesn't mean you have to use them, and their placement seemed a little awkward for the natural stances of the crack.

    Beyond whether this should be bolted at all (because, yes, you could totally protect it with gear), it's a fun climb.  Practice your jamming skills, but keep your eyes open--whenever the jams get sparse, there's a jug in reach.  I lowered, but it looked like you could walk off to left.

Sport Park is a great place for that. The crux dyno is pretty wild &amp; finishing it out is still powerful. A fun, short, very overhanging route.    I can see how someone would call this .11d, but there is a point where downrating a climb is really a great way to flex your ego &amp; draw attention to yourself. Calling this route about the same grade as Flying Machines (.11a/b) is pretty silly. I can think of numerous people who can climb most .11c or d routes but would struggle to send this route. Clearly rating are subjective. If dynoing &amp; hanging by one arm with feet dangling is your thing, then this route is for you.    There are 4 bolts / 2 Fixe rings on this route. Best advice is don't try to clip the anchor until you are on the long horizontal jug off to the right.

    The majority of this climb is more like a 5.7. If you aren't tall (I am 5'4"), clipping the anchors is a bit difficult because you can't just stand up and clip - find a good undercling like one of the previous posters said and toward the right for a so-so hand. You can then stand up and be close enough to get the anchors.   I don't know that I would recommend it for beginner leaders unless they are tall - in that case, definitely.  Not so much for the short ones.

    Great fun! Just below the anchors there is a solid undercling that let me reach the anchors easily.

    This is pretty fun and good for beginner leaders... it would be easy to reach high and clip if you are tall... but as a midget, it was a lot easier for me to clip the anchors once they were at waste level.  I though my clip position was a lot more secure even if you are higher up.

    Cleaning the anchor was wickedly hard for someone who isn't tall enough to stand under the roof. Took a lot of one arm pullups, a fireman's belay, and expletives to unweight my PAS and quickdraw. No interest in going through that again! I'd do the climb again as it was short and fun, but my partner will have to clean.

    This route is NOT manufactured, unless you count the jug on Dyno Monkey to the left. Rubberneck was one of the first two routes on The Visor. The moves past the 4th bolt originally had to be climbed up the thin, shallow, vertical crack to reach the natural hueco below 5th bolt. It is now possible to reach left off the thin crack to the manufactured jug on Dyno Monkey then reach the hueco on Rubberneck, making this section easier. Still the crux is the big dyno past the 5th bolt.

    I would have to disagree. I don't actually know what hold you are referring to left of the last bolt, but none of the holds seem manufactured to me. I dynoed straight up, maybe a little rightish, from the jug just below the last bolt.   Getting to the crimp by bolt 2 was very reachy, at 5'6" - ape +1, I had to use some bad sidepulls and a little bounce. My taller friend could keep his hand on the low rail.  The route to the left however...looked like several enhanced holds.
    Aug 20, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I believe that this route is manufactured. The obviously manufactured hold to the left of the last bolt can be skipped, which makes the route slightly more difficult. I cannot tell if one of the lower holds has been enhanced, but due to all the other manufactured holds on this wall I would think so.

    I got a chance to climb this route just after it had been bolted but before it was "complete."  Before the hammer, you actually had to use the finger crack which splits the big block while squeezing the edge of the arete.  It was tremendous fun and probably 5.11-.  Two weeks later that same winter I returned and found a 5.9+ bucket traverse up the arete.  Climb this route and imagine what was and don't think you just ticked an 11a as the "guide" book states.

    ...I'm new to Boulder and this was the first bouldering area I found whilst searching on my own.   Love this zone, thanks a lot to whomever put in the effort here.  I see lots of glue n' such, but no complaints as it has clearly helped "solidify" the spot into a great overhanging training ground.    I am curious on the ratings... there is one problem that moves from a sit start up and left and ends after 6 or 7 moves as you come over the lip, anyone got the scoop on this one?  Love that problem, great warm up!    I also noticed a 'lil spot about 100 yards back down the road that has a few quality moves on it and a ton of chalk.  Right above those problems is a way overhanging bolted route that looks super human, would love to hear the beta on this zone.    Sweet!  //SS

    Barrio traverse is a fantastic way to work hard moves on a route length bouldering problem. My advice on this problem/route: do not underestimate the second crux. Climbing through the cave crux is only the beginning. Also start the route from the sit start at the far left. Those moves are great too and add to the difficulty of the first crux. It's really an intense training tool as well. Once you get it. Add a 10 pound weight belt to your traverse and watch your forarms become machines of raw, crushing power! If you want to train power endurance for Rifle style climbing, you owe it to yourself to work the Barrio traverse. Have at it, and have fun!

    The bolting on this used to feel just fine, but I pried off two huge flakes, one before the first bolt, and one before the roof.  The climbing is more continuous and safer now, but it does feel kind of sketchy, especially climbing off the ground to the first bolt with a lousy landing.  Would the FA crew consider re-bolting the lower half to suit the climb without the massive time-bomb jugs it used to have?      Seems like adding a low bolt and then lowering the bolt below the roof a few inches so it could be clipped before the tricky stem would set it up nicely.

    Definitely the best route on the crag &amp; worth repeating. As for the grade, when I first climbed this route in Fall 2008, it was originally rated .12c. I   felt it was overrated &amp; not as hard as "Caught In The Web" or other .12c climbs. However, calling it .12a is a sandbag compared to "Free Fall", "Warf Factor", or "Furious Howard Brown" (all .12a). I have always felt it was solid .12b, if not .12b/c. I've redpointed it at least once a year since 2008 &amp; have yet to do it first try hanging the draws. I have always send it second or third try with the draws in place. Most 5.12s I have repeated on the first try. It seems harder than "Meteor Rhoadblock" (.12a/b) or "Tell Tale Heart"(.12b), at least that's my opinion. There are hard moves from the 2nd bolt to past the 5th bolt. The kneebar doesn't fit me at the 4th bolt crux, so I use an intermediate pinch &amp; then dyno to the jug. A very thuggish route.

    This is a surprisingly good route at a relatively obscure crag. The moves over the roof are super fun and a little cryptic at first. I didn't find any knee-bars in the roof, but I suck at that. I did a huge power move off the undercling to snag the jug at the lip. Without the trickery, I thought this route felt about 12b/c.
    Aug 17, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The kneebar does bring the grade down a bit (or a fair bit) at the crux; also the holds are much cleaner and less gritty thanks to traffic than when we put the route up four years ago. 12a/b for the onsight; 12a once you know it? I dunno...something like that. Not as hard as Warlock Pinche.
    Jun 30, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    We mistakenly got on this thinking it was the 11b/c.  I looked at the knee bar in thin tights and thought better of not doing it.  I pinched low and slapped over the roof second try.  I don't think this is harder than 11+/12-.  I defer to the harder side of that in light of other opinions, but it is not terribly hard.  I don't usually get mid-12s that easily when I'm going casual climbing after work.  I think the pinch is just bad beta.
    Apr 11, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Hmm, I remembered to use a kneebar, but used my left...which worked fine. Sometimes too little knowledge is a good thing. Felt more like 12a with the kneebar, but I don't want to be one of those downrating guys.  Regardless, quite fun and worthwhile.
    Mar 23, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I saw the possibility of getting a kneebar under the roof, but opted out with a series of underclings, pinches, and key foot sequences to a dynamic move over the roof instead. The tricky sequence getting to the 3rd bolt is just awesome. It helps to put your dancing shoes on up to the roof. Good eye Matt for picking out the best line at the crag.
    Sep 9, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Probably the best route at the crag.  A right kneebar at the crux (getting into the overhanging blocky rock) makes the crux straight forward and enjoyable, without the kneebar/kneepad (jessery, cheating, whatever) the crux is painful and hard relying on powerful pinching. Great route and nice addition to the crag....

    Nice mixed route.  It's still a bit dirty at the top.  You only need a couple of pieces of gear on easy trad until the first bolt, and then the rest of the climb is protected by bolts.  I didn't do the crux move as shown in the picture; I moved left into the corner, turning my right hand from a Gaston into a push move to gain the undercling on the left.  I felt the moves were more like 5.10.  Interesting moves requiring good foot placement.  I stayed under the flake at the top and clipped from the left side of it, but I suppose you might be able to jam in the crack above the flake.

    This is a good route, but it is harder than it looks from the bottom.  The middle section lacks positive holds.  At the first roof, I did go a little right to get a ticked sidepull to be able to stand.  Getting through the last roof to the turkey neck is the crux.

    Good eye to Josh and Christie for this killer link up--it takes the hardest climbing on three cool routes and links them up through the steepest part of the wall on nice, dark rock. I thought it was a fair bit harder, at least in terms of pump factor, than Pinche Guey. I'd say a 12a crux, to 5.11- laybacks, to a cool, technical, body-English 11+ crux traverse, then into the Pinche roof of Pinche Guey. ¡Orale!    You can also do "Rock Warrior's Guey," 5.12c, by traversing in from low on the right, beginning on the flat starting jug below the 11a corner. Arc up and across the blue streak to join Warlock Pinchers by the second bolt; harder if you off-route the jug flanges on the right for your hands. This variation is also "guey" pumpy.

    The crux is low (at the 2nd bolt) and thereafter the difficulty eases considerably.  Getting off the ground may be hard for the short; at 6'1", I could just reach the starting crimper; others will have to use poor intermediates with poor feet.  The crux moves are interesting; look for the hard-to-see R sidepull right of bolt 2.  A modified kneebar (more like a knee sidepull) may help exiting the crux.  Clearing the roof is fun but much easier than the crux grade.

    I climbed this today with Leo Paik and Doug Redosh. From the base of the Bitty Buttress route, we descended southeast for about 200 feet, then third-classed a long way east, across loose ledges, until we reached the start of what Rossiter describes as pitch two of Inagodadavida.     We top-roped the lower pitch, which is unprotectable, by belaying the climber as he traversed east to the "left [west] of two trees," then using the tree as a directional for lowering him to the base of the route. Beware of loose rock; it could end up on the highway.    Doug led pitch two, up funky cracks that diagonaled slightly to the east. When I followed (thirded), I climbed to the right of the cracks, up the middle of the clean slab, which provides unprotected climbing on good rock (5.6-). The top is guarded with a fence of loose blocks.

    Awesome route, the best of the day 5/17... Even though the route has the low angle slab in the middle of the 1st, it's still got some super sweet sections, especially the 2nd pitch. Another awesome route from Ron O. As I've been climbing here all day, I've seen so many people @ Boulder Falls parking lot taking pictures of everyone climbing... it's funny to think of all the homes across the country our pictures make it in to... we're all famous ;)

    This route turned out to be more interesting than it looks. Compared to routes like Mists of Avalon 10a, BC, and Bolting For Glory 10a, Eldo, I would call this one 5.9ish. I wouldn't think twice about recommending it to a 5.9 leader with good gear skills.

    A few bolts where gear was an option, but mostly right on. Actually, the route is decently protected by bolts alone, as the gear moves are not difficult. Do take a few long slings for clips that are not in-lin or are below a roof. The 3 stars is reflective of the length of the route done as a single 60M pitch and the exposure up top.  It is the top half of this one that earns its stars- the bottom is sort of discontinuous.

    Pretty fun stem problem and a little more sustained than I was expecting (though there is only one distinct crux). I think it would go on gear pretty easily.

    Interesting 2nd pitch!  The bolts are well placed.  It looks like a key hold might come out.  (There is a loose, triangular block above the roof that creates a good hand-hold.)

    By rapping straight towards the creek rather than re-tracing the route to the intermediate anchor, you can do 2 60m raps rather than 3. At the second rap, there are two anchors. Either works for setting the second rappel. The anchors here are all really bomber.

    If you have a rack, you can add some real value to this pitch by climbing straight up and a little left after the crux, moving through a couple of overlaps with good trad pro. Roughly hard 5.10 with some balance-y moves and lichen. After that it only makes sense to join the bolted line (or continue on trad up the easy groove). This variation roughly doubles the independent stretch of Smooth Operator, and it's very interesting climbing.

    That's really odd.  I'm used to downgrading their routes a few letter grades, but I found this one particularly perplexing and insecure.  I hung on it.  So, both in my wildest dreams, and in reality, I nodded to the 11+ grade on it.   For what it's worth, I onsighted Le Boomerang and The Contest without much trouble, and recently onsighted or flashed 5.12 on other climbs with established consensus grades, but this one gave me a fit, and my partner had trouble, too.    Perhaps you unlocked a sequence that they, nor I, could find.  In which case, good on you.  Got beta?

    Bob/Ron, The 11+ rating on this must be a mistake.  Not in anyone's wildest dreams would this route be 11+.  I think 11- is a stretch even by Boulder Canyon standards.  It is a decent route, but 10+ is a more honest rating.  Consider other 11+'s in the Boulder area:  Englishman's Home, La Boomerang, The Contest (I could list many others).

    Nice route with a fun, albeit short headwall - probably 11a.  However, I would urge climbers to be careful about the crux flake.

    Like Ken, I did a high step right at the top of the headwall. It appeared to be the logical exit move.     For a pretty nice, quasi-three pitch route, climb both pitches of Toe the Line, rap back to the belay beneath the headwall, and finish up Generous Donation

    Ken,  Thanks so much for the warning about the fixed line.  I went up and pulled the rope up so the exposed core was not on the rappel line.

Yes, I agree that it is much easier in the flat stuff section.  But I felt that this section is actually fun.  Easy but quite exposed with tons of air.  So to make it interesting, I purposely spaced out the bolts more than at the crux.  More run-out in easier terrain with tons of air!  I quite enjoyed it when I did the FA! :)  Those were my thoughts when I set it up.    Bruno
    Jun 27, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Ken,    Glad you enjoyed the route.  You would probably need a 70m rope to rappel from the top of the headwall back to the ground.  The end of the first pitch of Toe The Line is about 95' up; the headwall is another 30' or so.  I don't think you can get down from there with a 60m rope without doing some down-climbing.    Our intention at Tonnere is to make every route safe to rappel with a 60m rope.  Putting in an anchor that requires a 70m rope would be a dangerous thing to do, in my opinion.

    Bruno and Ron, thanks for the work in putting up this route, (and the tyrolean, and the trail work, etc.!)  The crux moves are cool -- those incut edges are small, but very positive.  I did a high-step right to get off the headwall -- was that your intention?      I did the route as a single pitch, combining it with the first pitch of Toe the Line.  Just a suggestion, why not put an anchor after the headwall so the route (Toe the Line 1st pitch + the crux 11 moves) could be done as a single pitch with a single rope rap.  This would make for a continous climb without all the low angle stuff at the end.    Also, we were going to rap your fixed line from the tree at top, but observed that about 8" of sheath is missing from the rope about 20 ft down from the tree.  I seriously advise not trusting your life to this rope.    Thanks again!

    I can see it being harder when first sent as there is still a lot of lichen on the route - especially high up.  You can send this in one pitch with a 60m rope.  You'll need two ropes for the rap though (perhaps two 50s would work? or like Tony said one 70 and a downclimb).      I didn't try, but I would probably agree with Tony that this could be a trad lead...probably pumpy to place gear though.  My guess is when it cleans up even more it would be 5.10b/c.  The lower section is quite continuous, but if you get good stances you can shake out.  Beta hint:  sidepull, sidepull, sidepull....etc.... Nice, fun route.  Well-protected if you are trying to break into mid to hard 5.10 climbing.    5.11a/b is my onsight limit right now, and I didn't seem pushed that far.

    I posted initially 5.11c and it was the feeling I had when I climbed it on my Shunt, when it was still full of lichen and moss!  In my opinion, it probably is more around 5.11 a/b, especially onsight.  But the grade being so subjective and personal, we will see a lot of variation on the grade people will post.    Update:  Nearly two months later as 08/04/07, I climbed Sidekick and in my opinion, this is 5.11a/b due to the continuous nature of the climb.

    65 ft of continuous moves on nicely featured rock -- this is destined to become a favorite at the grade on the Boulder Canyon sport climbing circuit.

    The best of the pitches I did here that day, worth 3 stars. Worth the trip up there to do, I was really quite surprised at the number of sidepulls one can do in a single pitch. Good find, though you might not want to climb it after a rain. It had some slick dirt/mud at the steep sections just 24hrs since rain.    I did this trad (gear only) with Jerry Bargo with a light rack of stoppers and cams. Doubles in the cams 1" and below might have been nice to have, but it went without. The climb had some 5.10 moves with a little runout, but not big ones. On the way down I cleaned the crack a little more. RPs and ballnuts could now be used where I did not place anything. This would make it well protected for someone with the skill to place small and complex protection. That may be tricky to get in solidly, so some minor caution remains. I'd call it PG-13 to be conservative. If you don't like it, clip a bolt; there is no risk of getting totally snaked.    Perhaps this makes this line an idea line for people just pushing into more complex and harder trad lines to attempt. Since bolts are available every few yards, one can easily 'bail out'    A 70M rope rap from the anchors got me down to a short 4th-class downclimb to the belay.

    This can be led on gear in one pitch with a 70m rope starting with Nick of Time. Only sketchy part of the final slab with no gear but easy climbing. Fun climbing up high.

    Buried Alive feels like the most natural line of pitches. Very fun three-pitch 5.9. Great intro for aspiring 5.9 leaders. Carry your approach shoes, as the walk-off is much easier and faster than rapping.    Pitch 1: (Buried Treasure) 5.8-   Pitch 2: (Buried Treasure) 5.6   Pitch 3: (Staying Alive crux) 5.9.

    People love this climb because it climbs like a fun trad route.  Lots of cracks, underclings and sidepulls, all in perfect gear placements.  Since mixed routes are common in the area, why not leave this one mixed, too.  Way to go.

    I climbed the first pitch arete. It was really enjoyable; I'd give it a 5.8 rather than the 5.9 listed here.

    Haven't yet done the first pitch, but the second pitch is, without a doubt, the very best 5.10a bolted climb I've ever led!!!
    Jul 3, 2012

    The last pitch is remarkable - as said above, maybe the best easy 10 in the canyon (aside from the questionable bolting). Start on Buried Treasure for a classic 3 pitch sport climb, I thought both pitches of that were better than P1 of Stayin' Alive.

    One of the best sport climbs at the grade in BC. Great, continuous moves, especially on the second pitch.  Perfect view of Boulder Falls the whole way.  Would be a stellar trad climb....

</blockquote><blockquote>
    P1 feels a bit contrived but has fun moves and nice position. P2 is fantastic, consistent climbing.  I agree that it could mostly be sewn up with gear (might be a bit dicey around the dihedral), but I still enjoyed it as a sport climb (and I'm mostly a traddie).  Thanks, guys, for putting this and the other routes up on Tonnere.  Cool area with great rock.  Hint: make sure you save some energy and hand strength for going back across the Tyrolean.

    The second pitch has a nice bolted crack on it...  Fun moves though.  I don't quite understand why there are 4 bolts after the crack, but whatever.
    Oct 4, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    P2 is a nice pitch. However, I'd be very cautious on P1. The 3rd or 4th bolt (second bolt on the pinnacle part of the arete) is attached to a very large block (which you obviously have to climb on and over) and, as far as we could tell, the block is NOT ATTACHED to solid rock. Only gravity seems to be holding it in place. For now....    EDIT: I contacted Ron about this block (9/23/07). He's looking into it and will undoubtedly provide an accurate assessment of the situation.
    Sep 23, 2007

    P2 is great! Fun underclings and side pulls with footholds that aren't always obvious. The dihedral requires some thoughtful footwork, too.
    Jul 1, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The first pitch arete is spectacular, because you are on the arete with lots of air and good climbing.  The second pitch is fabulous!  The dihedral crux makes you think, then the easier, undercling arete keeps the pitch very interesting and airy!  A classic at the grade in Boulder Canyon!

    In short, pitch 2, use a big right side hold that's on Total Eclipse, 5.10+ variation.  Climb stratight up in the bulge/roof as per the FA, not using the big hold on the right, 5.11 b/c, pick your letter.  I am NOT changing the grade.

    Another great route.  The roof is easy, and I thought the crux of the first pitch was no harder than .10b.
    Oct 8, 2011

    P1 is definitely 10b, not d.  It's easy to get off route on this one.  If you head up from the anchors, you end up on P2 of tow the line, 10a. Head right I guess if you want to do the "true route"  This part of the cliff definitely feels grid bolted.
    Dec 8, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    We thought we were doing P2 of Total Eclipse, but I guess we ended up on P2 of Tag team -- it seemed like a more direct line (lot of bolts up there). Going up the right side of the little roof felt like mid-10.
    Sep 23, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Fun climb, did it in one pitch with a 70M rope.  Can rap from the anchors down to the start with a 70M rope.  Don't follow the crack too high on the first overhang or you'll miss the jug over the roof.  Second overhang seemed a bit awkward.

    Bruce,  &gt;Which illustrates another point about ratings: different people read rock differently -- especially on-sight without colored tape (OK, chalk) to identify the "right" holds. .11b/c or .10d, it's an interesting, if short, puzzle.     Yes, ratings are very subjective to those factors.  Hence the need for a consensus rating and stars voting system that MP provides so nicely.  Thanks Andy!  You get an average from many perceptions from many climbers of various rock reading abilities, climbing styles and body sizes.    There are no "right" holds in my opinion.  There are holds that fit one person and other holds that fit others.  The key is that each individual will use them differently to fit their own individual body sizes and climbing styles/reading abilities.    Indeed, using those holds in a different combination is an awesome short puzzle to solve.  The discovery of that puzzle is the beauty of onsighting a route and climbing in general.    &gt;Our thanks to you and Ron for the hard work you put into cleaning the routes.    You are so welcome.  Ron and I are glad to hear that you and others enjoy Tonnere Tower for the climbing it now offers to all climbers who visit this crag.    Cheers,  Bruno

    "You are right, I went straight up since the holds were bigger and cleaned. Thus my proposed grade of 5.11 b/c when I freed it."    Bruno, not knowing about the bolt above the roof, I worked my feet up to the good holds near the highest bolt under the roof and then torqued right to the hold occupied by your right foot in the crux photo. Which illustrates another point about ratings: different people read rock differently -- especially on-sight without colored tape (OK, chalk) to identify the "right" holds. .11b/c or .10d, it's an interesting, if short, puzzle.     Our thanks to you and Ron for the hard work you put into cleaning the routes.

    Bruce,  You are right, I went straight up since the holds were bigger and cleaned.  Thus my proposed grade of 5.11 b/c when I freed it.    One thing I would like to say:  The more accurate grade is the average grade that will end up as a classic statistical "bell curve"!  Strong one day, less strong another day, you are small, you are tall.  For some people it will feel like 5.11 b/c, for some others, like 5.11a and even 5.10d.    Take all this into consideration and the statistics sums it all.  So please people, keep voting, it's the whole purpose of the grading and star voting system on MP, let's constructively get an average!
    Jul 30, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Two enjoyable pitches. The crux on the first pitch seemed like .10c; pulling the right edge of overhang on the second pitch seemed like .10d. Going directly over the roof to the bolt above the lip (which isn't visible from below) would definitely be harder.
    Jul 30, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Mark,  I buy that!  When Tag Team was a start variation line, it was not very popular.  Then it gained popularity when we did it as an independent line.  It must have cleaned up quite a bit by now.  Therefore, it probably got easier, however I did not use the edge that Bruce is talking about.  Or perhaps I am just more out of shape than I thought! :)    But for the moment, in my opinion from what I felt when I did the first ascent, the grade I propose is 5.11 b/c ...if you go straight up!    Will climb this route again in September.  Update:  Climbed it today 08/04/07.  In my opinion, I maintain the straight up exit is 5.11b.    Bruno
    Jul 26, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Lets do a reality check here - 11b/c?  Come on.  It is a great route, do not get me wrong. Thanks to Bruno and Ron for putting this up.  Maybe it was harder when it was put up due to lichen and loose rock.  10 for the first overhang and 10+ for the one move second overhang.
    Jul 24, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Bottom section is cool.  I didn't care for the one move wonder above it.  Inadvertently pulled out some loose stuff at the top of the left hand crack at the 11 b/c crux.
    Jul 19, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Be careful going over the first roof...I don't think you want to get over and blow the clip.  Not a place to fall as you will probably hit the wall below pretty hard.  Perhaps this bolt should be moved a bit lower - a bit closer to the lip?   Not a criticism, just a safety thought.   Much appreciation to Bruno and Ron for bolting/cleaning this fine route.  You could also run this with one 60m rope, but perhaps place some runners before the overhang to avoid rope drag.   Though if you place one right before definitely don't blow the clip after the roof...I thought the upper crux was much harder.

    The original 6th bolt on Tag Team, which traversed over to Toe The Line, has been removed. Tag Team is now a completely independent two-pitch climb: a fun face and overhang on the first pitch, and a tougher overhang on the second pitch.  If you're not up for the second pitch, give the first pitch a try; it's really fun!

    Loose tooth right below p1 anchors is still there. It is pretty loose and is wedged between solid rock and a much larger also loose block. If either of these loose blocks comes free, it will probably be bad for the belayer.
    Jun 5, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Fun fun route!  Use both sides of the arete as necessary; not only keeps the route at grade (although it felt way easier than .10b when I on-sighted; my friends disagree), but the airyness while switching back and forth is what makes the climb so fun!  Great second pitch - I look forward to leading that next time.
    Jul 3, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    As of July 2012, right before topping out at the P1 anchors, there is a smallish prominent "tooth" that would be a sweet jug right on the route, except it's loose. It holds a decent-sized boulder in place, otherwise I would've cleaned it off. Chalked it up with an X. If you pull it, it will go right at your belayer. Just be careful.
    Jun 30, 2012
</blockquote><blockquote>
    By staying on the face and clipping the third bolt and then continuing on the face to the 4th bolt, I felt that this was much harder than a 5.10b.  I would rate those two bolts (from 2-3 and 3-4) as a 5.10d and the rest as around a 5.10a/b.  Also, I felt that after the arete, when you throw a high right foot and step up, that this was a fairly committed move with slabby feet and not extremely positve hands.  A bit of a balancing act for the whole climb.
    Aug 13, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I didn't read the description very well and went right onto Tag Team after the 5th bolt on the 1st pitch so I'll have to go back and do it straight up.  The crux at the third bolt can be climbed 10a by staying to the right of the bolt, or if you use the holds on the left of the arete I thought it was 5.9.  Of all the pitches I've climbed on Tonnere I felt this route was truest to its original grade.
    Oct 4, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    We stitched the two pitches together to make one, long wonderful sport climb at near 60 meters. It's worth doing only if you don't mind the full weight of the rope at the top as well as have ~20 QDs in your possession.
    Aug 20, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Never having climbed the route before, I *thought* the crux was a little testy for Boulder Canyon .10b. Hard .10 seems right for the step right in Ron's photo. Thanks Michael.    The first pitch and the first 1/3 of the second pitch are really nice: devious climbing that doesn't end at the third bolt crux. 2 1/2 stars (can we give half stars?)
    Aug 22, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    It's worth noting that the original line on the first pitch stepped right at the third bolt, but that was prior to a loose block being cleaned. I revisited this route a couple of days ago and this move still goes, but more likely at hard ten or 11a. To keep the grade at 10b, swing out left to easier holds.

    I led the first pitch. Totally believe the 5.9 rating. It was fantastic, really enjoyable set of gyrations needed to get around on it.     I believe I moved a little far left, clipped into a bolt from Tag Team and went under the roof before moving right back onto the route. If you're interested in an exciting little variation, that one's totally worthwhile.
    Jul 14, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I can't really comment on the grade of this route, because I don't even think I was on it. I have no idea how I ended up doing this, but I started at the slab for Total Eclipse, at the roof ended up going straight over at the Tag Team one move wonder .10d (which I thought was .10c) and then ended up at the anchors for Toe The Line...still a fun climb though!

    Last week I met Ron at this crag, and I must say it was a pleasure. He was incredibly nice and offered detailed info on his new routes.     Regardless of your stance on "ethics" of climbing and what gear you choose to use when you climb, Ron deserves thanks for putting up these routes. He was covered in dirt the day we met and his shins looked pretty destroyed from all his work. I can't say that many climbers I've met in Boulder would work so hard.    I've now climbed a lot of the routes here and they're great. Save your ethics and politicking for next year's election. Thanks, Ron.

    I sincerely appreciate all the work that went into cleaning this route, but there really isn't a need for bolts on this climb.  Bring a light rack and a 60m rope and you can send this in one nice long pitch.  Felt like a 5.8/5.9 at Lumpy Ridge.  Two 60's for the rap, maybe two 50's would reach not totally sure.

    Using the right-facing edge at the crux makes this route easier than its grade, imo.  And it's well within reach.  Great route!
    Oct 8, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The climb is interesting, but like lots of crowded sports lines, I kept asking myself "is this on?"  Leading it, my left arm was never more than and inch or two right of the vertical line created by bolts, but depending on what you grab with your right, the difficulty can greatly vary.    On lead I was stemmed to make the second bolt clip (pretty much right under the bolt), and then without taking a step, but just by shifting my weight on to the hold my right foot was on, I could reach the arete.  I'm pretty sure that isn't how the line is intended based on the 10d rating.  I would say using that arete the climb is no harder than 10b.  I then tried variations on TR.  Using that downward pointing flake just below the little bush/tree on the corner instead of the arete the route felt like it was about 10d, maybe even 11a (is the next hold on the right off?  I could clip while holding it...).  I played with going to the left of the bolts, but that was definitely harder and I gave up on that (probably at least mid 11, but I can't say since I gave up...).

    A nice little route that delivers more challenge than would appear from the ground.
    Sep 8, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'm curious.   Was the fixed lost arrow towards the top of this present prior to the recent ascents and cleaning?  No doubt it would have been from an ascent of the crack system just right of this climb if so, but it should have precluded that top bolt placement.    I found the route to be 5.11.  I warmed up on it not knowing what it was and went left (ha ha on me). I and my partner each took falls when we scaled off or broke off a foothold or chunk of one, but the climbing is now presently pretty solid overall.    I can see the reason for the first two bolts (the second one held my fall) and the third, albeit just below a bomber stopper placement, is clipped overhead just before an insecure move (crux?), but the rest of the bolts are within inches of good gear placements. Perhaps this should have been a mixed route?
    Sep 22, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Rate it by the path of least resistance, which, in this case, goes straight up the bolt line. That's how routes have traditionally been rated. I would agree with the mid 5.10 rating. Fun crux.
    Sep 19, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Fun little line. If you like thin slab stuff, give it a try. Climbing slightly left of the bolts, seemed like a couple 11 moves. Otherwise 10c/d. Didn't know how to rate it due to the variations. Enjoyed playing on it, though.
    Sep 19, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Fun climb even if short. Interesting crux. I think 11c would be a more accurate rating (based on leading it).

    About 3/4 of the way up the first pitch, there is a loose chunk of rock that's covered in chalk, because it is supposed to be the hold for a particular move.

    I combined the last pitch of Buried Treasure with the last pitch of Staying Alive, which resulted in much rope drag. However, this does make for a long and enjoyable pitch, just make sure you have several long runners and consider back cleaning or skipping some bolts.
    Sep 21, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I lead this today, with the Buried Alive linkup, and enjoyed it quite a bit. I would definitely put the third pitch at 5.10a, and I think the first route goes at 8+, if only for the sequence right by the tree. There's a nice two/three finger pocket that makes it much easier, but without it, I can't see the pitch going lower than 8+.     To anyone doing the three pitch linkup, I would recommend anchoring on the two bolts at the top of Stayin' Alive's first pitch, rather than the bolts on Buried Treasure. There might be some drag up the second pitch, but this anchor is visible to the bottom belayer (the normal anchor is not), and the zig-zag out left to the first bolt only to move back right to the second bolt made for a pretty nasty fall when I took the wrong approach.     All that said, I really enjoyed the route. The crux on p3 (the finger crack dihedral section IMO) was fantastic!

    Did the "Buried Alive" variation this afternoon. So awesome, highly recommended! The first pitch is a fun 5.8 with some cool moves (I'm a newer leader so if you're really experienced maybe not as fun). The second pitch is pretty short but has some neat exposure. The real fun is doing the last pitch of "Stayin' Alive", 5.10a. Just awesome... like I said I'm a newer leader, so this felt pretty exhilarating for me. Regardless, I think this route is well worth doing. Great views of Boulder Falls (had lots of tourists staring/pointing/taking pictures of us while climbing lol...) and great climbing. One complaint: if you don't have runners or slings, there is definitely some serious drag on that third pitch.    As to all the trad vs. bolts debate... sure this route could definitely be done on gear, but some people don't have a rack (myself included); someday I hope to lead trad and have a full rack and maybe I will come back and do this all on gear, but let's face it, this is Boulder Canyon... it's bolted out the wazoo... you wouldn't be preserving anything by taking the bolts off this unless you somehow took the bolts off the other 700 some odd sport routes in the canyon. (In other words... have pity on those of us not fortunate enough to have a full rack.)

    Just climbed "Buried Treasure" this afternoon, and I must say this has got to be one of my all-time favorite climbs. It's been so hard finding quality, bolted, multi-pitch routes in the canyon. It really is "Buried Treasure," as finding a route this well-bolted with this much vertical climbing in such a bomber spot is really discovering something new.    That said, please don't retro-bolt or remove bolts from this route. I'm new to climbing, and I'm hoping to eventually become a trad leader doing multi-pitch climbing. The standard progression for a climber learning to lead trad is to lead sport routes before attempting to lead trad. We need routes like these still available for amateurs like myself to practice the belay transition, hauling, and top-belay systems that are crucial to know when doing a multi-pitch and/or big wall climb. The bolts aren't affecting where you place your trad gear, so please cut us a break and leave the route as it is. I'll promise to approach it in a year with my trad gear.

    Good route. First pitch is a solid 5.9 with the second quite a bit easier. A great first multi-pitch, or just a fun climb for the more experienced. I for one am glad that it's bolted. I took a less experienced friend on his first multi pitch, and was glad to be able to just climb a moderate sport route with him his first time. It's nice to have a few of these longer sport routes in the canyon to teach or just have fun on. Leave the bolts up!

    Great route with some interesting variety and expansive views. The bolts near the bottom felt a little widely spaced for my tastes. I was glad the route didn't require dragging up trad gear, giving it a more modern feel than some of the "mixed" routes in the Canyon. This area would be relegated to an obscure footnote in an aging guidebook without the bolting effort. Instead, parties were lined up waiting to play on clearly popular routes -- good work!

    I can see where you'd place gear.... But I think some of the bolts are "necessary" near the top of the first pitch. The bolts are there, it would be stupid to remove them, live and let live. This place saw no attention before Ron O, Bob D and crew so they should develop it how they saw fit. What used to be an overgrown, mossy POS crag now sees 20+ climbers on a sunday afternoon.    Overall, it is pretty overrated. 5.9?!?

    Yo admins, why were my comments about this climb removed?!  The Cascade Creek discussion prompted me to look back at some of the prior comments I made after doing most of the Tonnere Tower climbs, but they are all gone!  I simply don't understand, are only glowing reviews of this climb acceptable?    FWIW, I climbed this specific route and found that the overwhelming number of bolts, especially those on the third pitch next to the crack in the corner, to greatly detract from the climb and the overall experience of the wall.  It could have been a great route.

    E Johnson: Birds get to fly because they have wings, fish get to live underwater because they have gills, and trad climbers get to climb cracks because they use equipment available since the late '70s that protect cracks without leaving a mark. If you want to climb cracks, learn to place gear in them.  No one is making you climb cracks, go nuts on bolted slabs!  Just skip the bolts, I mean cracks!    Just because the rock can be bolted doesn't mean it should be.  Placing a nut in a crack and removing it when you're done should preclude drilling a hole in the rock and pounding some metal into it.    Jeff Welch: I carried a light trad rack up the 5 minute approach because I heard they over-bolted the place and wanted to skip the bolts, yes.

    Buried Treasure was intentionally created as a sport route, to provide an easy multi-pitch clip-up for newer climbers (this is how we rationalize bolting cracks). In almost all places, it can also be protected with trad gear. If you prefer to place gear, bring your trad rack (nuts and cams up to 1") and see how many bolts you can skip. If you prefer to clip bolts, bring your quickdraws, no nuts needed.
    Sep 16, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Traddies have been driving past this crag and route for at least 50 years to get to Castle Rock, yet never bothered to do it.  It was hardly cutting edge difficulty, even 50 years ago, so you can't use "too hard" as an excuse.    If it hadn't been bolted, it would probably remain undone, or at best, obscure.  As it is, it's a fun, easy, well-protected multipitch climb that seems to get regular traffic.  I doubt that would be the case if the bolts were removed.    I bet not a single person would have carried a rack up here if not for the "see how many bolts you can skip" challenge posed by the FA.

    Concering a loose anchor,     The nut is loose on the left anchor. I still rapped down from both but would not recommend this to anyone! The anchors are mentioned above in the beta.

    Guess what, there are climbers who don't climb trad. And never will. While trad climbers can choose not to use the bolts and put their gear in the cracks (the bolts aren't in their way in the cracks), but if you lead sport, what? you are sorry out of luck because a bunch of purists get to decide when rock gets bolted?? I was up at Exit 38 in WA appreciating the rare opportunity to have lots of moderate sport routes to gain lead experience on and then thought about Boulder Canyon, or Boulder in general and how there are all these people who think "if it's protectable, nearby bolts are an abomination and should be chopped". As much as I love where I live and the granite of the canyon and the close proximity of a lot climbing, it was a drag thinking about the attitudes I would be returning to.     It's just rock climbing, people, and there are different styles. Why should trad preclude sport climbing? Sport climbers aren't stopping trad climbers from doing their thing. As soon as you step off a trail you've changed nature. As soon as you apply sticky shoe rubber to the rock, you are aiding. Live and let live.

    I led this yesterday with a set of cams and stoppers.  I feel it is rather well protected.  As Tony has stated above, I think this route should be considered for retro-unbolting with the first ascentionist's permission.  I think the bolts left of the crack on P2 of Staying Alive are an atrocity.    This part of the climb in particular is well protected and does not warrant permanent fixtures.  I encourage other 5.9 leaders to lead the route traditionally and weigh in on the issue.    For those looking to lead this marvelous climb, a set of stoppers (every other size will probably do) and cams to 2 1/2 inches will be suitable, perhaps with doubles in the 1/2-&gt;1 inch sizes.    -chris

    One of the better lines in this part of the wall, sadly, it deserves no more than 2 bolts. Lead ground-up on gear while cleaning it, the only bolts that tempted me were those leading out right to gain the arete 2/3 up, but I found myself on 5.8 jugs anyway... Both bolts there are OK, but only one was really needed to protect the moves.  If those had been the only bolts this would read differently, but that is not the case.     I cleaned a lot of cracks out with my nut tool and sewed the climb up as I liked, save for that one place. It's a shame it was not done in mixed or trad style, in my opinion. This is a good candidate for the FA party to reconsider the bolts on. In my opinion, the route would be improved.

    This makes for an excellent toprope route (and its neighbors) with a 60 meter rope. The rock quality here is particularly high. Also, it can be well led on trad along, but the placements at the end of the dihedral/corner systems are thin.

    There's a new loose block halfway up the route. It's to the right of an arete, at about 55', just before getting to the bulge described above (70'). It's very tempting to place gear behind it, but do not! I marked it with an "X".

    Be careful! There are now quite a few loose blocks on this one, including a ~50 lb. loose/detached flake right below the anchors that looks like a very inviting handhold but is actually precariously balanced on another loose rock right below it.  I tried to figure out a way to remove it when I lead this route today, but there were too many people at the base to do it safely.  I marked an "X" on it with chalk, but it rained right after we left, so I doubt that will stay.  Someone should probably remove the flake when there are less people around -- it's beyond ready to go.

    Worthwhile trad route with interesting route-finding, but an oddball grade.  About 5.8 or VS 4c at Tremadog.
    Oct 14, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Believe it or not, I was initially accused of sandbagging by the area developers! The grade was reflective of the FA condition lead for a single move up on the quartz up high while cleaning on FA, relative to other routes here.  With that considered, it was set to more closely match the others at the crag than what we would have otherwise given it.  A compromise, perhaps and certainly not representative of other areas.     I note in the book, it has been given 9+....  It is probably easier since this thing cleaned up a little.    The nice thing about "voting" the grade here is that over time it will come to consensus.  Please do 'vote' the grade as you feel is appropriate here.
    Sep 26, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'm surprised you did the first ascent of this route and graded it Tony, because usually I agree with your grades. I thought this climb was very easy at 5.9+ and fit well with the overgrading at the rest of the crag. Maybe that was what you were going for? Maybe it has gotten easier as it has cleaned up.    The first ~40 feet are cool. After that it was pretty nondescript until the cool final moves on the quartz crystals at the top. If the middle cleaned up a little more it would get better.    Also there was a head-sized block loose right below the anchors. We didn't trundle it due to the large amount of people below in the direct firing line.

    I flailed on this on the lead. Thought it was in the 10+ range. The individual moves are not quite that hard but always low 10 or harder, they are tricky and easy to screw up, and the rests are marginal. Gear placements are always from tenuous stances. Dan Hare (FA) was there as I was struggling on this, and he remembered it being hard and tenuous. Gear: Double Aliens from green to red (single if you place them in the correct sequence) and a couple of nuts in the 1/4" to 3/8" range. I placed a gold/#2 Camalot into the good jam, but that turned out to be a mistake. Better to make the move and place a smaller cam in the rattly finger lock above.

    Have to say it was a bit taller than 15 feet, Maybe 20-25 but still only took 2-3 pieces that will actually do anything due to the to the small rock wall behind/under the belay. You can very easily go in between this route and its neighbor to add some spice if desired.

    I wondered what this route was when I did it (only have the Rositer guide) and after i did it, I penciled in:  Unknown, 5.9+, That was my honest best guess.      I'm not trying to be inflamitory, but I honestly believe this route was no harder than 5.10a.  I can't say it is any harder than Cosmosis (9+), let alone Gates Of Eden (10a).  It is nowhere near as hard as Left Wing (10c).    I was up there and did it in the drizzle.  Even a pal who hadn't climbed for a year (an has never made an 11 in his life) was able to do the moves.    We saw the extra bolt-hole too.  I bet it was not placed/removed because it wouldn't keep you off of the ankle-raking boulder behind the route anyway.

    This and "The Altar" seemed contrived to follow right over their bolt lines as there is easier climbing within in reach just to the R ond L respectively.

    Funny to hear that the name is related to the bike accident.

    Stop reading if you don't want beta:    The bad sloper at the first overlap can be avoided all together. Before pulling the overlap work the feet as far right as possible. Hands on the good undercling.    Move the left hand up to the high side pull (just right of the bolt) while leaning way right.    Work the feet up.    Right hand to slightly slopey crimp (just above and right of the sidepull the left hand is on).    From here, it's one move up to better holds.

    Great route.  Shady until late afternoon, and somewhat protected by rain from a roof above.  I don't really dyno at the crux; I do more of a lieback off the terrible right sloper.  It's important to lean left for the sloper to be effective.  I then let go of the left undercling and statically--but quickly--get the jug rail above.  The route is not long but I find it pumpy.

    Pretty good. Pitches can be linked with good sling work if you don't sling the anchor and go right after clipping the top bolt with a 2' sling. The rope line is direct that way.  Makes a maybe 150' pitch or so.    2 cruxes:    1) The poorly protected move to the right on P2 in the crumbly rock with bad gear and a questionable flake is probably 5.9+... if your arms are long enough to span it on the best holds. If not, then harder on worse rock and holds.  2) The roof, which is somewhere in the 5.10 range depending on finger size. My thin fingers were not the best answer. My partner told me I also missed a "bucket" hold (incut), and I just kept climbing. Yes, a red Alien would have been nice there. I ran it out a little instead of getting pumped trying to put a Camalot Jr. in (which is what I had). The Aliens/FCUs/etc. are going to be better, since the crack is not a nice parallel crack - they'll fit in there. There are a few insecure moves after the roof that might have you pausing if you just ran it out 15'..., but with narrow cams or medium offsets that should not be an issue.

    Nice pitch.    Kinda exciting from the new sport climb anchor to the crux roof. The crack is grainy and exfoliating with a large flake that is not very solid. Once to the crux roof, the gear becomes great. Good call on bringing extra big fingers gear.    There was no way I was downclimbing to the good, bad, and jacked anchor. I left a bomber #9 stopper and biner and lowered to that anchor. It would be nice if it stayed there for an easy descent. I assume an anchor is out of the question because of the proximity to the Vampire, an old established route, but it would make repeating this route more enjoyable.    10+, 11- seems about right.

    The bolt line suggested to me to stay left and lieback a weirdly featured arete on the upper part of the pitch, but that seemed silly once I moved into the small open book with a fine finger crack. It's a worthy pitch even if the start feels brushy and grungy.

    The climbing is decent, but it is quite dirty, and the bolting seemed all over the map.  Many of the bolts weren't visible from below, so you pay attention or you might miss them.

    At the "finger crack", if you proceed up the bolt line (the finger crack is a bit to the right of the bolt line) I think it's harder than 10b. Anybody else try it on the bolt line?

    Climbed this route again years after the first time. The rock is quite a bit worse than I remember. I recommend a #4 for the roof so you can place it deeper in the ear where it's less of a flake.

Now that I'm done bashing the route, the roof move is fun!

    I thought this pitch was really fun. The jamming up to the roof thing is solid even though the rock is a little quartzy (weak). Before firing the roof, get a shake on the jug to the left on the arete - the exposure is quite nice. After the roof, I wanted to go straight up on the left, but there really wasn't any pro, so I came down and traversed right to finish with "Trash It and Move On". This finish is good, but make sure you extend after the roof and on the following bolt or you'll have a fair amount of rope drag. Do your best to protect your second on the traverse.     I didn't take a number 4 and was fine - there are tons of other opportunities.

    Gotta disagree about the bolting job on this line - definite possibility for unpleasant falls at a few spots along the route, which is a shame, because it's better than the second pitch of Le Stat.  also, i'm going to argue that the crux of this climb was more difficult than either P1 or P2 of Le Stat; it involves a tough undercling sequence with shit feet and not-much-better hands.  also very beta-intensive.    If you're solid at the grade, however, hit this line up, because it's better than P2 of Le Stat for sure.

    We had no idea what we were getting on when we started this pitch yesterday.  It looked easier than the bolted line to the right.    Get a good belay to start this pitch because you could hit the start ledge if you blow it above the first bolt.  After that I thought the route was protected fine.  Cool climbing past a few bolts will get you to a 12" wide positive ledge to inspect the crux before you commit.    Although the description says you will hit the higher ledge if you blow the crux my partner fell without incident.  That said, if you were balancing really close to the wall and came off, you could possible tweak an ankle.  Fun route worth doing!

    Scott's right, that bolt near the top of pitch one is poorly placed right at the edge of the roof, so your carbiner gets loaded over the edge.  Best to link pitches 1 &amp; 2 as one. Third pitch is barely 5th class, but the fourth pitch is good. Pitch 4 is a lot of 5.10 climbing with a very stout crux move (for me). But it's good, safe and fun.

I think that calling the second pitch 11c is misleading, however.  While the crux is less steep than the P1 crux, the holds are smaller and the moves more balance-y.  11++ for both pitches.
    Jun 22, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I think 11+ is a good rating for the first pitch.  A hard undercling move (FULL extension deadpoint for me) gets you to the bolt before the crux.  I tried both ways (straight up and left) and think left is a bit more reasonable for an verage height person.  I was nowhere close to reaching the crimp flake straight up (I'm 5'10").    I started up the ramp directly under the crux section instead of starting on the left with the 10+ boulder move traversing up and right.  Personally, I think this way is more straight-forward.    This pitch is nothing to write home about but the pitches above are pretty cool!

    First pitch is very hard for the grade.  Not what you would expect for a Boulder Canyon 11d. This would be a hard on sight on less you were prepared or told what to expect. After failing first time up trying to move statically thru the crux. I moved left on the finger tip crack and dynoed for the horn with bad feet. Once executed it seemed not bad. Kind of a quick boulder problem move. Seemed hard the first time up but once I did it in retrospect it did not seem too bad. Perhaps that is the reason for the 11d rating. I am not sure what I would rate it for the onsight.

    The crux on P1 seemed hard for the grade, but it also appeared as though there were two ways to do it: going straight up from the finger ledge and then traversing left or traversing left on the finger ledge and chucking for the horn on very bad feet (this seemed pretty hard). Good stone despite the whipping.

    When the bolts lines split, I went up right and then traversed back left under and then over the roof. Felt just solid 5.10 climbing without any 10+ to me. Trying to hug the bolt line straight up seemed a bit contrived. Maybe that is how it becomes 10+. Above the roof felt harder than below for me. Gotta give right until the chains. Either way fun climbing. Either 5.10 variation worth a go.

    We really enjoyed this climb, the multiple small roofs kept this interesting to the end.  One question though, Stephen, how bad were the large flakes at the last roof before they were glued (the middle 10d version I guess from your description)?  It seemed to us that if they were pulled out it might  have made the climb an 11 or so (but who knows, right?).  That was the only drawback for me, seeing all that glue.  Just wanted to get your thoughts on why you wanted to save them.

    This route (the straight up variation) is called "Monkey's Uncle" 5.10d. It is located approx. 30' right of "Wanker" (behind tree and boulder). 3 variations exist; going left from 3rd bolt out small roof to thin holds on headwall is "A.C.E." 5.12a . The middle line up small corner and small roof is "Monkey's Uncle" 5.10d . The easy right hand finish is "Monkey's Sister" 5.10b/c . All end at same 3 bolt anchor.

    Really interesting, albeit short pitch.  I thought there were 2 definite cruxes, getting past the 2nd bolt and getting past the 3rd bolt.  For the crux at the 2nd bolt being tall seemed pretty advantageous.  On the flip side, being tall at the 3rd bolt sucked.  By the time I rocked over onto the left foot, I already had the shitty, slippery (yet somehow sharp) crimp at my shoulder and didn't have much range to pull it down.  Instead, I ended up using a right hand, flake gaston (above the hold that you spend half of the day hanging out and dunking your hand into your chalkbag), and left hand manteling.    The fun doesn't stop there though, as the holds are still kind of weird and insecure, and you have to make a few moves to clip the next bolt.  For a bolted 11a in Boulder Canyon, this one felt pretty legit.

    I like the bolt spacing.  And I am of shorter stature so, the first clip was a bit sporty.  Also seeing how far the next bolt was I opted to clip a lone 'biner to the first bolt to save a foot or drop should I blow any of the moves above.  I'm also going to have to go with no more than 11b.  I don't usually onsight 11c and definitely not 11d!!  The pro is adequate but that's it!! No more no less, I thought the movement was great and, although short, it was a pretty exciting pitch!!

    Hi Ray,    I bolted Pincushion and the project above.  I agree, Pincushion is probably 2/3 letter grades harder than 11a, but it seems every new route in the canyon gets massively down-graded; therefore, we decided to start on the low-end of the scale.  I disagree, I think the protection is adequate, and it doesn't detract from the quality of the pitch. BOTH minimal bolt placements AND pitch quality were equally addressed. The project above isn't lavishly over-bolted - it simply appears that way because the first couple bolts are close so the climber doesn't hit the ledge and/or belayer if he/she falls when climbing directly above the belay.  Thanks, BTW send me an e-mail, let's get out - we haven't climbed together in about 10 years.  Take Care,    Dan

    I apologize for the lack of clarity in my earlier posting. I thought that the sarcastic tone was sufficiently established in the first sentence to carry over to the second.    So I will be clear. I think that Pincushion is noticibly harder than 11a, and believe that the bolt placements were made with an eye toward minimizing the bolt count, not toward making a good 5.11 route. This might be more understandable, but still quite ironic, in the context of this being an approach pitch to a lavishly bolted project above.

    Downgrading it for now as it is a bit dirty. Also there is a good sized (~5#) loose rock near the top...deceiving because it looks absolutely solid. Be careful belaying underneath this route until the conditions improve.    FYI - the rock is in about the last ten feet approaching from the right side of the bolt line. It is a small pillar in a small corner that looks attached at the base.    Added 7/16 - it was not so loose I could remove it, and there was a bit of a crowd at the base, so I didn't think it was the time to start kicking and punching.

This variation looks like it takes gear at first, but then turns into scarey looking slab climbing.  When I got up there, traversing into the right crack (as described above) seemed the more logical, and safer, way to go.  So after much confusion and hesitation I went that way.  The crux takes very good stoppers as well as the #1 sized cam.

    Jeremy Lubkin and I replaced all bolts on That's Weak today. The impetus for replacing was the left hanger at the anchor, which was a Kong aluminum hanger, like the two that broke in a single incident at Index in 2009. I was concerned someone might get to the anchor, clip into that bolt, then go off belay before clipping the second bolt (a fair number of folks do that...especially Europeans) or continue to an upper pitch and have an anchor hanger break in a multi-pitch situation (yikes!).    We replaced all bolts in the original holes, and the new bolts are 1/2 x 2.75" stainless Power-Bolts. The anchor has stainless links to the new style Climbtech mussy hooks (wire gate, hardened, anodized dull green).    The old bolts were in good shape considering the 21 years they've been there - they all looked pretty good except for the scary aluminum hanger. Rust wasn't too bad.

    If you follow the bolt line (rather than climb right, then hand traverse back) I think this line is legit 5.10 and features interesting and not at all awkward climbing.

    Good, tough route.  Climb edges past bolts up an increasingly difficult vertical to slightly overhanging wall.

We went this way so we could claim the historical tick.... Starting on That's Weak is way better.      P2: is pretty fun.  Still lots of loose stuff, but better.  My favorite hold was the rotten, loose chockstone being held in place by the old ring pin.     P3:  We were surprised at how easy pitch 3 was, nowhere near as ominous as it looks from the road.... One move off the belay then 4th class-ish.     P4:  The last pitch up the left-facing dihedral looks disgusting but is pretty fun.  The gear is good, so you can take the chance and do a full body stem to avoid the oozing poop.  If done right, you don't even have to touch the crack....    Right before you top out, you can step down to a bolt anchor.  From here, it is 2 raps to the ground with a 70m.  Not sure if a 60m will make it, but there are plenty of other anchors to shoot for it it doesn't....    1st rap lands you just under the pitch 2 belay @ the anchor for The Good, The Bad, and The Jacked  (skipping the anchor on the ramp).  And then, from here to the ground....

    Actually kind of a fun route. Has a bit of an alpine flavor to it in terms of the rock itself. (i.e. a bit of moss, looser rock here and there). The first pitch of 5.7 is the worst in terms of quality, so if you would like better rock you can climb That's Weak and arrive at the same anchors. The rest of the climb has some very nice sections and interesting moves. Has a few cruxes so recommend you be solid at the grade. Nice views and a fun adventuresome outing. Solid 5.9.

    Nowhere close to 3 stars.I would give 2 stars for the variation which climbs the left line, through the first roof, to the 2nd set of anchors (The Bureau???).  The stretch up to the 3rd set of anchors, however,  is among the more jingus sections of rock I've climbed in Boulder Canyon.  A key block in the roof is attached to the cliff by a vat of glue, and is secured to the cliff, in case it comes off,  with a 4-foot chain attached to the last bolt.  A few other key loose holds here as well.  This section of the route is fully worthy of the coveted cb.com bomb rating. I also felt it was the crux since I onsighted to the 2nd set of chains, but failed in this section (which could possibly, but not likely,  be attributed to lack of inspiration instead of increased difficulty).      As for the lower pitches to the 1st set of anchors, I agree with the previous comments on the poorly located 4th bolt on the right line.  3 closely spaced bolts on the lower climbing followed by a spicey crux well above the 3rd bolt getting to the 4th bolt.  WTF???!!!  A stopper or alien may work in the finger slot, but I find it surprising that gear would be required for a route on such a nearly-gridbolted section of cliff.

    Sangdahl's clarification above is quite useful.  Nate Adams and I did this route (the right hand route, which I now understand to be Wanker) last summer and we both made the fourth clip without being too scared.  I will say it would have been a much more comfortable clip if it were a foot lower, but it is not so bad as is.    Another error in the guidebook is the rating and the noted location of the crux.  Nate and I both thought the first roof was 12b and was definitely the crux.  The guidebook shows a 12c crux in the second roof, which is no harder than 12a.  It also lists 12c as the overall rating, which I was willing to buy as an overall pump crux sort of thing, but Sangdahl says the rating is 12a/b, which is closer to the actual hardest move.      Guidebook corrections aside, this is a steep shady route that really has fun climbing.  The 11d section at the 4th clip is tricky and slopey, and the first roof is really puzzling the first time through - it gives you the choice between trying to ooze up a dihedral with holds all going the wrong way, or up a short arete with tiny holds.  The second roof isn't so bad, but you get pretty pumped up there.Overall, a very good line - the full 60M route is probably about a dozen clips, and if you do it all the way to the top, it deserves at least 2 stars, maybe 3.

    Just to clarify; the route known as "the Bureau" and "Wanker"(not "the" wanker)are switched around in the sport guide book. the route listed above is "Wanker".

"Wanker" 5.12a/b is the next line to the right and goes all the way thru both the 4'roof and the 7'roof in one long pitch(back clean where appropriate and use long slings to avoid rope drag,60m rope can lower one to ground) This route can also be done in 2 pitches, p1(5.11d)ends below the 4'roof and shares a 2 bolt anchor with the bureau.(the 4th bolt is easy to clip if one heel/toe hooks the left foot in small corner to lock in,the 3rd bolt is just below your feet) p2 is as follows,crank out 1st roof(5.12a/b)climb up and launch out 2nd roof(5.12a)past bolts,fixed wire,and block chained to wall,to a stance above roof at 3 bolt anchor.F.A.;Steve Sangdahl and John Baldwin, with Chip Ruckgrabber assisting on "wanker" summer 1999  Also from the shared anchors on bureau and wanker one can traverse 40' to the right to the anchors on "Monkeys Uncle".This is called "Nothin but trouble traverse"5.10b .one can also top-rope the hard roof below the 2nd bolt of this traverse, this is known as "More trouble than its worth"5.12b/c. f.a.of both by sangdahl and baldwin ,summer 2000.hope the beta helps.

    I agree. This route is 12a/b and really fun. The first  three clips are a jug haul to a small roof. Then you move left and reach up for this crack (this is the part that I felt was the crux) , rock up on the lip and you're in a great position to rest. Then you crank through a couple more moves and out to your left is this killer hold that if you get it right, you get another massive rest. The rest of the climbing is straightforward and fun. I think this route definitely gets 3 stars.

    Willie, the 5.11d rating for Voodoo Child is "old school" i.e. sand-bag  It probably is 5.12a.  Glad you enjoyed the routes.

    Thanks, Steve, for the correction.  I was going off Rolofson's guide, and I believe the routes are switched.  Not only are the names wrong, but the ratings seem switched too.  At the time I climbed these it didn't matter,  because we didn't have a guidebook.  I only referenced the guide before submitting the rock and the routes to this site.    Anyhow, the far left route seems 5.11- until the ending (5.12b/c?) move.  I didn't get it, and therefore I didn't write it up.  Perhaps I'm missing something.  The middle route sounds correct at about 5.12a, and the rightmost seemed 11d or 12a.  Whatever the names and ratings, these are all good sport routes.

    These must of got switched around in the guidebook. Voodoo Child is the route on the left, 5.11d; Porch Monkey is the middle line of bolts out a roof to start, 5.12a; Sufferin' Succatash is the right hand route up a corner, 5.11? Steve Sangdahl.

    I thought the route wasn't too bad for the crag - the upper section above the small roof was definitely better.

    I'm not sure why this route doesn't have a higher star average. I'm not sure what more you could ask for from a slab route at the 5.7 grade.

    Now the route sports *five* bolts and a two bolt anchor. It is good fun, but I wouldn't call it a great beginner route. It is a low-angle and very positive, but the five bolts protect a 25m pitch - you do the math... I suspect that most gym-bred beginners will not be happy with the potential tumbling falls. A competent Eldo 5.8 leader, no problem.

    Best route of the area. Couple of fun roofs and some nice exposure if you stick with arete. The anchor is quite far right.

    Two bolt anchor at the top eliminates need for tree anchors (perhaps now it is aptly named?).  Also, more bolts made this a fine lead without gear.

    The crux is moving right onto the slab under the roof; turning the roof past the final bolt is much easier. Beta: there's a good hold on the left edge of the roof; you just have to work high enough to reach it.     When you lower, leave the last bolt below the roof clipped if your partner is top-roping.  This will keep the rope from running across a sharp edge on the roof should your partner fall at the crux.

    Well, if  you don't use your left hand for the first 20', then you can't use your right foot for the rest of the climb, it makes it 5.8.  Just kidding.

Be sure to place directional pro at the top of the crack for your second before moving right to the anchor on Glennevere.

    Bummed the anchor was moved, but I am at least glad it was done by the FA crew.  The logical route now seems the left line, which removes the route's second crux and perhaps downgrades the route.  Perhaps, you just didn't have time, but it seems lame to leave the old bolts.  They should be chopped and the holes should be covered if you're going to make the change.  Clipping was exciting and fine from the old location.

    Not too hard or runout, but certainly an 'adventure climb.' Plenty of lichen and a few loose blocks. The grade on the first pitch seemed about right. No single trip up this thing with a brush will make it clean, but the route would be tremendously improved with a some effort from each of several of the next attempts... take a brush. Also, perhaps 50 or 60 feet up there is a flake/spike to the right that someone's second could push off after verifying that the trail is clear.

    Was this climb retro-bolted?  I climbed a route to the left of Tese that seemed to share the same start as Romancing the Stone, but went through the small, tiered roof system and then up the north face of an arete to the top of the buttress.  There's a photo topo posted in the Romancing the Stone route with a small bush under the tiered roof system that has been cut out and a bolt was placed above it.

    This is a damn near classic route. There is a little bit of hollow rock here and there but nothing that's going to come off in a catastrophic way. I kept climbing past the anchors into the neighboring 10-, and this creates a really good mini-extension to an already awesome moderate. Doing the pitch this way, the route is exactly 30m. Tie knots in the end of the rope! All that's really necessary in terms of gear is a finger-sized cam for after the 2nd bolt and a long draw on the anchor of this route to climb up to the anchor of the 10- without rope drag.

    I did this route yesterday with no gear. I didn't feel it needed it. Perhaps a tad run out but nothing compared to what you can find in RMNP. A groundfall from the third bolt seems only probable with a bad belay. I had a lot of fun climbing this, and got down with a smile on my face. Interesting/fun movement for the grade.    Tread lightly. There are some large flakes that if pulled off could be potentially fatal even with a helmet. Belay should back off the wall after the 3rd bolt.

    Great climb, no need for gear but HOLY SHIT! Loose rock! Be very careful climbing this one. I pulled one baseball-sized piece with chalk on it and felt many a large flake move under body weight. Put your belay far right and wear a helmet!

    Great route.  I found the route to be clean with no loose rock so get on it!    It's just fine without any gear if you are solid on the grade.  Use a couple long slings to reduce rope drag.    Also, there are two 3rd bolts - not sure why.  We clipped the left one.

    I'd agree with those posting about loose stuff, mainly large and some small flakes.  Because of the comments, I was doing the hollow punch test, and there was a lot that didn't sound good at all.  Unfortunately, this really takes a lot away from an otherwise fun warm-up route.  I am sure that in the next few years if not sooner, this route will change drastically due to large blocks and flakes coming off.  Be aware of what you are pulling and stepping on while on this route!

    The climb to the right is much better without the loose blocks.

    Matt - I'd have to disagree. I had a blast on it! Really fun, and pretty safe, especially if you place the supplementary gear. Sure, there's some loose rock, but that's all part of the outdoor experience, especially on crags facing that aspect. BTW--a helmet won't do a belayer much good if any of those aforementioned blocks go. Just sayin'. Have fun out there!
    Jul 11, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route isn't good at all. The looseness of the rock makes it kind of serious, so make sure your belayer wears a helmet for sure. I tried to avoid the loose sections as best as I could making it probably a bit harder, but if you just tromp around on the flakes, it is probably 5.8. Anyways, super crappy climb. Not recommended at all.

    The above comments about loose rock in 2008 are still very relevant today. I did the route a few hours ago and was quite surprised by all the loose rock.  The bolts have a lot of run out (the possibly of a ground fall exists even after bolt 3 and 4), so I placed some protection and witnessed a huge flake expand with just a light tug on the cam.    Fun, but be careful both when on the rock and when belaying.

    I have to agree with Jeremy. This climb (while a lot of fun) has a lot of missiles hanging, waiting to release. I'm not normally a fan of altering routes, but it would be nice to see some of the more questionable items removed, simply as a safety matter.    Fun climbing, though
    Jul 21, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A nice route, but it's not 5.9; 5.8 at the most, maybe 5.7.  Maybe I'm biased because I've been climbing a lot in Eldo recently.  The moves past the hanging flake are indeed cool, but be careful.  As Jeremy implies, all things are temporary, and some of those flakes seem to be potentially more temporary than, well, other things.  Climb lightly, and tell your belayer to stand off to the side.

    I did this one more 'directly' and did not step left to the Camalot placements, and as such hit some questionable rock. A good route overall though, but I was trying to figure out what was what, as maybe 50' up there were two diverging/converging lines available with bolts to the left/right of each other. Was a little confused on which was the intended line.    No less, it was a nice long pitch done to the top anchor and was enjoyable. Thanks for 'finishing' the route.

    The creepy and loose sounding rock on the middle of this route really took a lot away from this route. I'm sure it much more solid than it seemed, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was going to pull a HUGE piece of rock off every other move.  I think it would be a really good route if you weren't a wuss like me and just cranked on everything.
    Jun 16, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A good route with varied moves and nice exposure.  The layback past the hanging flake and the moves up the arete are fun and airy.    I placed a red Alien after the first bolt, a #1 Camalot (or #2 Camalot) after the second bolt, and a #.5 Camalot to protect the final move to the anchor.    Romancing the Stone and the neighboring route Tese are must-dos on your way up to Sherwood Forest.

    The climbing is ok, but unfortunately it is an absolutely filthy pile. If for some reason you are compelled to climb this thing, bring a couple wire brushes, goggles, and a dust mask. I looked like I had been working in a lichen mine after climbing this thing. Also, the bolts could have been a little tighter through the start off of the ledge. Be prepared to 'make contact' with your belayer.    (edited to add) i went back up and scrubbed the lower section pretty thorougly which improved the climbing quite a bit.  upper section is still really dirty.  lower section felt much easier this time, but the upper section still felt a little dicey.

    Definitely one of the best 10s in the canyon.  Awesome climbing and a nice extension.  I found myself smiling every time I put a hand somewhere on the rock where I thought a hold would be, it was there pleasantly.  Getting to the first bolt can be one crux depending on how you do it, and the second is the roof.  Once that's done, it drops down to very pleasant 5.8 climbing.  Do it!

    Possibly the best 10a sport route in the canyon, I can't think of any better ones off hand.  From the moment you leave the ground until you clip the anchors, the climbing is good and fun.

    This route is full of fun moves with really excellent climbing all the way to the top.  I personally found the committing move just before the third bolt to be too disconcerting to attempt without the added pro; my partner, however, did not have a problem relying solely on the bolts.

    Greg Hand wrote: "We have left the 2-bolt anchor at the half way point for climbers with shorter ropes."    The midway anchor is no longer there.

    Great route! The extension makes this climb a great pitch - thanks to the FAs. The lower section (overhangs) has a few spots of interesting rock, though. I remember tapping a hand-hold and feeling my feet reverberate... (just after finishing the overhang).
    Jul 21, 2008

    What a great climb. With the new extension, there are four sections: a thin slabby part followed by a blocky roof section, then a fun arete and finally a relaxed corner at the top. Agree with Bob that this is one of the best 10s in the canyon. Thanks Greg and Bob for extending it! (Note that you need 11 draws plus anchors... skipped the alien myself, and seemed fine.)

    Tese has been extended to 100 feet.  Now you need 11 draws to a 2-bolt anchor.  A 60 meter rope gets you down. Tie a knot to be sure.  The second half is easier than the first and has fun climbing on the arete. There is no longer an anchor at the half way point. If you have a 50 meter rope, you may need to go to the anchor on No Direction Home or Scarecrow to the right.

    I thought the movement was good, but the rock didn't feel that nice. Also, I have done it after it rained earlier in the day. The rock looked dry, but I had a hard time with wet lichen at the 3rd or 4th bolt. The rubber did not want to stick to the rock.

    I thought this was a pretty good route but was a little confused between the 2nd and 3rd bolts. Does the line continue straight up, or angle left to share a few moves with Panic Attack (AKA BOB...Bombs Over Baghdad))? I tried going straight up but couldn't find a way past the blank spot that felt 11 b/c. Angling left seemed reasonable for the grade but seemed a bit off line.    As Slim said, be careful with the clips. The business is right off the ground on this route. I think blowing the 2nd clip could put you on the starting block as well. You clip from a decent hold, but I recall it feeling tenuous - possibly bad feet?
    Jun 23, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Calling this one of the best pitches of the grade in the canyon is pretty silly.  There is about 10 feet of climbing on it, then a bunch of meandering up easy dirty/lichen climbing.  The protection isn't well thought out either.  The 3rd bolt should be lower so you can sneak a quick clip off the lower gaston.  In it its current location, the stance is still bad, and if you blow the clip you will probably crater on the starting block.  I don't think I would recommend it to somebody breaking into the grade.

    Made the not-so-clever decision of top-roping this route from the anchors on Romancing the Stone, located high on the arete formed by the N and W faces.  It seemed like it would be the easiest way to top rope this and the other two routes on the N face by simply moving a directional runner each time (the RTS anchors are directly above Teenage Terrorists).  But there is a lot of loose, funky rock between the top of these north face routes and the anchors on RTS. Our rope dislodged a good-sized block that exploded between my partner and myself. Suggest if you want to top-rope here, use the actual route anchors instead.    Btw, War is Love has some really good moves on positive holds.

    I have climbed this route several times since 2000, when I first documented it in the first edition of Boulder Canyon Sport &amp; Adventure Climber's Guide. The climb is not an easy .12a, &amp; I usually do it on my second try after hanging the draws. I think it may have gotten a little harder at the crux past the 5th bolt, since part of a hold on the right side of the arête has broken off. I would compare it in difficulty to Kudjo Tranquilizer, that I originally rated .12a but is now rated .12b. The two cruxes on Kudjo are hard but come after perfect ledge rests. Living with The Apes is more sustained from the 2nd bolt past the 6th bolt. Then there is a good rest before the slab finish. At the 2nd bolt, strenuous lieback moves lead out left on a flake to face moves ending at a good hold below a small overlap. A technical, vertical face follows with an exciting clip to 5th bolt. Then the real crux, involving a small hold on the arete &amp; side pull/ undercling on the face to get the feet up &amp; reach.    I place a red Alien to reach the very high 1st bolt. After 15 years, this climb could still use some wire brushing between 2nd &amp; 3rd bolts. In spite of lichen, the movement on this climb is so good I have enjoyed repeating over the years. There are 10 bolts.

    While not essential, some may find a 1"  to 2" cam below the first bolt to be helpful.  Nice climbing with no raptor issues that I noticed, at least in the fall.

    I was here last Thu for the first time.  There is a large nest about 40 ft up the cliff.  I'm certainly no expert, but there was a good-sized raptor that flew away when I was within 50 ft of the base of the Zoo (coming from Animal World).  We bailed.  The routes are within feet of the nest so I suggest staying away.  Anyone else been there this season?

    Hard for the grade. I have always thought this climb was 5.11+, &amp; I would give it a PG-13 rating. There is a 20 foot runout between the 6th &amp; 7th bolt on juggy, moderate terrain. However, you must get your feet up &amp; stretch up to reach the 7th bolt. Thankfully there is a nice, incut jug.    Perhaps more concerning is location of the 3rd bolt, out right of the cracks you are climbing. The moves get hard here &amp; involves a vertical, thin crack for the right hand &amp; a diagonal crack for the left. The left crack begins with a hand jam but then turns into rounded sidepulls. A fall here (even though not far) would be a swing down &amp; sideways, where you could easily hit the corner &amp; arete below or the rope. With draws in place, you can hang a long sling or a long draw &amp; medium draw off the 4th bolt. This will allow you to clip from lower &amp; then clip again to the upper draw. The actual crux is past the 4th bolt, &amp; it is well-protected.    This climb has cool moves &amp; interesting climbing. Primate Studies &amp; Living With The Apes both share the last 2 bolts &amp; anchor.

    The "West Crypt" of The Pit at Mackey (on the west side) offers a few fun traverses. "Stairs Diagonal Left" and "Stairs Diagonal Right" traverses just above the stairs on both sides on solid challenging (V1-2) "rock".    The "East Crypt" of The Pit at Mackey is chossy and crumbly. the only fun thing I found was the ascent of the dihedral, topping out at the back of the crypt. The stairs traverse is a bit chossy but OK.    The lights at night are great for an evening session! Darker during the day.

    Getting off of the roof would be tricky, but if you would rather not wait for the janitors (as nice as they are) then you might want to walk across the roof to the north side where the roof is shortest.

    Truly a classic. Every pitch is terrific, and each are distinctly different in nature from the others. The traverse into the crack on pitch one never fails to make me hesitate and heighten my focus on the move into the crack -  trust those feet and finger jams (thankfully it protects very well with one or two 0.5 cams in the bottom of the crack). The 2nd pitch may be the best of the climb; it is long and continuously engaging at the 5.6 level (maybe a 5.7 move or two). The 5.8 crux on pitch three is an exquisite sequence of delicate balance to pure power back to delicate balance. The 4th pitch has been overlooked due to the quality of the 1st three pitches, but it is a gem itself requiring imaginative and gymnastic movement on 5.7 terrain. The final chimney pitch is fun and best enjoyed as a free solo.

    Just onsight lead this on Sunday June 18th at about 4pm maybe, nobody at the bottom and a group sitting atop pitch 2. I'm a 5.7 leader and follow 5.9.    Here is current beta:    Did Rewritten first same day, Bastille is def. harder, it's steeper and more sustained 5.7 moves. However, it's not too polished or slippery or overcrowded to miss out on this classic. Go to a pure crack climbing crag, and see what it's all about. Then do climbs like this, and you won't complain!     Pitch one beginning is not as hard or as slippery / polished as people are making it seem, the crack is very nice for jamming and laybacks. With that being said, definitely helps to have crack climbed 5.7 before because the climb goes 5.7t, but this is not the crux IMO. The next part after the chains is def. harder, crux probably in there somewhere, but the whole climb is sustained.    Also good note to protect the beginning, pretty positive I got a 0.3. I was in the crack on the left before I pulled into it, I also had pieces on the right. I'm 6'0" tall, and stemming from the flake on the right to pulling and laying back into the crack on the left was enjoyable and not that hard.     Pitch one 65ft is easily combined with pitch 2 with 60m rope assuming you have essential gear by climbing past the chains on the left. This is where having crack climbed really helps, as it's pure, beautiful, vertical, steep crack up about 80 feet to a good obvious belay ledge.    Here you are atop pitch two in one pitch a long, beautiful, sustained line that goes pretty straight, once again the fun doesn't stop here. The next pitch follows the obvious steep crack on the left, more laying back and jamming with little feet, it's only about 70 feet, and you summit over a big, left-slanting ledge that you stay into the right corner, and at this point there is a lot of rope drag. So what I did was built my anchor in the obvious crack just to the left at the bottom of the next pitch. This is what I thought the best thing to do was. Worked well.    Finally the last pitch is about 130 feet, you need runners for this. Still the intensity of this climb keeps going, it is sustained until about the last 50 feet, haha. There was a chimney in the end which I always think are easy, but some may call a b. Anyways with what you got to work with, I found it best to belay about 5 feet short of the summit in a little alcove behind a boulder at the top of the chimney. Basically, it worked well for us!      Descent: from there go back up and left find Ivy's wire, clip a biner into it, unclip, follow the wire back to the south on the right through a tight, gullyish down hike. There is one spot 4th class. There is a big wall on your left, and Bastille is directly behind you. Follow the wall down towards the south passing a big, gnarly sport climb on the left, carefully make the hiking trail!    Do this climb towards the end of the day, don't let someone say it will be sweaty or chalky. If you can do the moves, what's the issue. Less and less people will start this climb the later it is, and people leave. Now's a opening instead of waiting and being bored, climbing while watching the sun go down is magnificent, can't beat it! Hope all this helps lol. This is how much I loved this climb.

    Dropped a yellow #2 cam off of the third belay station. It fell quite far down to a ledge below. If found, please let me know, and I'll throw some cash/beer your way. Thanks a million! Oh, and the climb is wonderful. Give it a go if you get the chance...just be sure to hang on to your cams. Cheers!

    A bit more about getting down: when you reach the saddle at the top of the chimney on pitch 5, you are at the top of the route. The saddle rises up briefly to the northwest, or falls off sharply to the south, or rises up, by Ivy Baldwin's steel cables, to the southeast. Go southeast, up, past the cables, about 30 feet, and wiggle through a large inclined gap in the rock. You'll find the descent trail on the other side of the gap. The trail follows a gently descending ramp, that travels southeast along the entire west side of the Bastille. There are a few places where a short downclimb is necessary, maybe 10 ft, but not more than that. See the annotated photo in the photo section for the route.

    Bailed at the top of P3 yesterday (11/6/16) (partner was panicking and we had run out of daylight), I had to leave a #0.75 Cam, a green DMM biner, and a locking biner at a piton lower down. If anyone recovers them, it would be great if you could reach out to me to return them.

    P4 variation - what is it? Went straight up from the belay instead of traversing left. Still crossed the traversing gap but then set up the belay by the pin and headed straight up through some easy roof moves (harder than 5.6 though). This seem to be the harder variation described but haven't found any info on a name or thoughts on the rating. Just curious.    P4. 5.6, 100'. Traverse left to a short corner with a destroyed fixed pin. Continue traversing left on awkward, off-balance moves past another fixed pin (crux). Go all the way left to a hand crack, and climb it to a corner. ****Don't start up too soon or you'll be off route on a harder variation.**** Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney.

    This was my first rope solo back in 1975, and after decades away, my wife and I made a quick overnight trip in and out of town last year so I could do a fortieth anniversary rope solo of it.    Unfortunately, however, we were so tired we ended up oversleeping in the hotel that morning and found the usual conga line on the route and in line when we got there. I was pretty bummed, because I only had a few hours available for the climb and it clearly wasn't going to be happening from the end of the line at the rate things were moving. Then all of a sudden, and seemingly out of nowhere, dark clouds and a truly fierce wind came up along with some rain, so everyone in line scattered and the first two parties on the route bailed. Once everyone dispersed, I was able to jump on it and was lucky the wind edged back a bit and the rain became intermittent. All in all, it all made for a fairly wild and somewhat less-than-casual go of it, and I felt incredibly lucky to have been able to do it again.    But the most striking thing about the whole experience wasn't so much the climb but rather that so little had changed in Eldo and on the route itself since 1975. It was like being whisked back through the decades in a time machine - I still can't get over how odd that aspect of it felt. On top of that every other move and placement was like running into a long lost friend with all kinds of memories flooding back. It was also a treat to be able to lay a hand on Ivy Baldwin's cable at the top.    Say what you will, but it's as timeless a classic as they come.

    The Bastille Crack is, in many climbers opinion, one of the best moderate multi+pitch routes in North America. If you have strong lead+climbing skills at the 5.8 level, a competent, experienced partner, and the weather is nay cold, you should have a blast. (If either of you flail on the first 1/2 pitch .. heed the Gods and rappel at the chains, otherwise all kinds of negative are likely to manifest.) Enjoy the crack climbing by making the moves slowly, with the joy of physical movement. Be courteous and graceful at the base, and en route, as the desire to climb this route can result in amped up emotions amongst fellow humanoid rock climbers.... Pay homage to our passionate &amp; ballsy &amp; talented patriarch, tight+wire walker (sans leash) Ivy Baldwin at the top by clipping the 1" steel anchor cables. Then perhaps head up to the Visitors Center, and watch the DVD of the history of the Canyon with footage of Mr. Ivy Baldwin's high wire walks  (and then hit the pool (now heated, summer 2016,) for a grrreat way to soak it all in). Enjoy.

    I thought 5.7 was fair, although I'm from the Midwest, so I'm used to stiff grades. The first pitch was amazing but not nearly as difficult to climb or protect as people are making it seem. A #4 helps a lot for psychological purposes, because you can shove it in that huge flake right before doing the crux traverse, although you do have to play with it to get a solid placement since the crack is a bit flaring. I actually found the short 3rd pitch to be the crux of the climb. Exiting that overhanging finger crack by pulling over the small roof was quite spicy on lead, as there were next to no feet and I ended up having to lock off a crimp to get my feet up and pray there was something better above (luckily, there was a thank-God jug!). Knowing how to crack climb definitely helps (esp. for 2nd pitch), and if you don't, I could see where people would find the route sandbagged, but if you do, it's an incredibly fun climb.

    Anybody have the backstory on the exploded pin on P4? As I wandered by it, I got lost in a daydream of someone blowing it out as they whipped by holding a loose block, although I suspect something more mundane, like someone trying to remove it via funkness. It would make for a nasty landing if that was your first and only pro and you fell.

    Climbed Bastille Crack and Rewritten the weekend of 8/15/15. In our humble opinion, Rewritten is a grade harder than Bastille Crack. So 5.6/5.7 or 5.7/5.8, take your pick. Personally have Bastille Crack at 5.7 and Rewritten at 5.8.     Most of this route is protected from the sun which is nice. P1 is pretty polished. P1 &amp; P2 are the crux pitches goes easy after that. The downclimb from the summit is pretty cool.    Bastille Crack and Rewritten are awesome climbs!

    Loved to solo this at sunset, but it's harder than 5.7 sandbagger rating back in the day. When you're 30 feet off the deck and you realize that you committed yourself to this free climb, you're focused like a fiend. Didn't want to start "The Elvis" and peel off. Much relief at the summit by the old cables with the orange sunset. A memory etched in my mind forever. Felt a rush of adrenaline in my veins after that climb that got me hooked on climbing for life.

    Did it in 2 pitches yesterday morning with a 60m.    Single rack to 4.  If this is your first trad or trying to break into 5.7/5.8, the crack will SEW up with doubles from fingers to 4.  No needs for nuts.    0.3 protects off the deck very nicely.  If you're comfortable running it out, 2 pitches is the way to go.

Has anyone done it in 2 pitches with a 70m? I was thinking you could link pitches 1-3 (the best climbing), and 4/5 with some long slings for the traverse on pitch 4.     It's also quite easy to link 3/4 with a 60m, I thought about attempting pitches 3-5 yesterday, but we had a 60m rope and I think I would have came up about 20' short and had some bad rope drag.

    Does anyone know what the grade is for doing the more direct line for pitch 4 (according to the pitch breakdown in the description).  I didn't traverse all the way over to the handcrack/gully and instead took the first line up that I could (shallow, corner-type thing that turned into face climbing past some shrubberies).  The grade felt in line with the previous pitches, and besides being a little dirty/loose, it was fun.

    After many years of not doing this route and just walking by...  Plan B ended up with us on this route while rock trumbling was going on at Redgarden!    Personally found it to be anti-climactic!  Pitch 2 was great! Combining 1 &amp; 2 would be a great pitch and maybe 1, 2, and 3 with a 70m would be stellar! 4 and 5 were just not interesting, blocky, and slightly wandering ... feel these 2 pitches take away from it being classic!    Atop pitch 3 is a fixed cam a #1 &amp; 2 maybe a 3 cam should help that belay also a stopper, too.  Atop pitch 2 with a pin gear about 1 to 2 inches... I used a lrg stopper and tricam....  Extend those runners to not sacrifice your cams... so many cams walked deep into the flake systems....  Leave the small stuff behind... and the big stuff, too, 1/2" to 3" place non stop, so double up on those if you like placing pro very 8-10 ft. and personally think of this climb as G rated!    Superfun, though don't get me wrong... will do again for sure... enjoyed the historic pin scars, and blown &amp; cracked pins on this route... good reminder to back them up or just skip and place pro!

    The transfer at the first crack can easily be protected with a 0.5 if you can reach across to the crack.  I placed this before I fully committed and was way fine.

    Tyler, the first three pitches are way harder than 5.4. If you think The Wind Ridge (5.5) is harder than the Bastille, you are crazy. Calling this climb 5.4 goes well beyond sandbagging, it's being a jerk.

    Pitch 4 did have that funky stance on it, but I don't think it's 5.7. I have sweated bullets on 5.6 pitches in the Gunks, and this route was CHILL. If this is 5.8, then I should be one-hanging Jumbo Love.

    Call me silly, but I found P2 to be a good deal harder than P1. P1 was scarier until you've protected after the step-across, but otherwise, I wonder how P2 gets a lower rating? Superb climb and excellent for every foot of it to the top of the last pitch!    In addition too, linking P1 &amp; P2, with 70m doubles we easily linked P3 &amp; P4. It could possibly work with a 60m single if you are smart with your pro placements on the first part of P4 and don't mind running that part out.    BTW, my 5.8 rating is just in relation to how the climb felt to me compared to ratings in Yosemite Valley. Eldo's ratings are stout :-)

    A friend and I did Bastille Crack a few weeks ago.  I have a question about the final pitch variations.  I the new (awesome) Eldo Guide book it lists an 8- PG variation that climbs the corner off-width and it lists an 8+ PG-13 variation that takes the nice crack just to the left of the off-width.  We did the "8- PG" variation which approximately matches the "fun finish" listed above, and found the gear by the crux to be a little lacking.  Maybe a #5 would protect the last few moves up the off-width, but with a standard rack you find yourself about 10 feet above your last piece(s) and only 16 feet above a ledge.  I haven't done the crack to the left, but I have a hard time imagining how the gear could be worse given that it's a finger/hand crack.  Any thoughts?

    Did this climb today for the first time, and it was great.  I did the 8 variation on the 2nd pitch and didn't have any big cams but was able to slot a nut up and left from the start of the short traverse.  The variation was not to difficult, but it did feel a little run out.      It had rained last night, but the route looked dry. The 4th pitch felt like 5.8s though as half the holds had water on them and couldn't be used, be careful if it's wet.

    Re the fourth pitch: when in doubt, go up and left. When you can't see around a corner, reach, and your hand will land on a 5.6 hold. If it looks harder than 5.6, don't go there. If it feels harder than 5.6, you're off route. Remember up and left.

    I climbed the first pitch of this last September.  My second lead at 5.7, and yeah, the step below the crack is slippery, but if you reach into the crack, there's a tiny ledge of rock inside the crack on the side that you're stepping from that you can wrap your fingertips around and get a pretty solid grip (or was I dreaming).  I had to feel around in the crack for a bit to find it.    It was a lot of fun, and just the first pitch deserves classic status for being as vertical as it is at the grade, and the rock is beautiful.  Clouds rolled in and it was raining as we rapped down from the first belay.      Re: the grade...I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I don't see people trying to upgrade Friday's Folly, which I led the day before, and found much more difficult, at least in the problem-solving and psychological aspects of it.  For one, the moves on the first pitch of the Bastille Crack were obvious, no guessing, and if you have trouble placing adequate gear here (how?!) you should work your way up to the grade more slowly.  It was easy to protect, even for a beginner like me.    Having to watch out for cars while you belay is a little odd....

    There is a very loose flake right below the second belay. It makes for a great left foot when heading for the belay ledge, but when I stepped on it it flexed about half an inch.

Pitch #3 was definitely my favorite, with great position and gear.  I did the traditional finish up the chimney, and finished that by moving left from the top of the chimney up about 8-10 feet of slightly overhanging pocketed face.  It was a fun, bouldery, but very short add on, that reminded me of Hueco Tanks.

    Led the first pitch again yesterday after doing a number of 8's recently  in Eldo and at JTree, and no way is the first pitch 5.8 - at least not for a 6' male with a -1/2" ape index.  5.7 definitely feels right - but your crack technique and gear placing skills must be solid.  I'm also not sure why folks get confused about the 4th pitch.  To me, there's only one place to climb that looks anything like the published grade of the pitch (5.6).  Everything else anywhere nearby looks MUCH harder.  OTOH, I find the description above of this pitch to be confusing and not matching the pitch well.  Just move slightly down-ramp from the belay and climb up in the easiest spot and follow the easiest climbing.  It's really pretty obvious (of course, maybe I'm just not a good enough climber and so am not tempted by the other possibilities! ;^)

    The third pitch is perhaps the best 5.7 pitch I've done anywhere.  Simply amazing movement, location, and protection.    Also, the 4th pitch is very easy to get confused on the proper route.  Check the topo before you leave the ground.

    After never wanting to wait in line, I decided to send this route on Sat. morning.  Got to the base about 6:45 and no one was on the Bastille, yet.  Found the route to not nearly as slick as I thought it would be and 5.7 a very fair rating.  I think most of the route is 5.6 with a couple 5.7 moves on P1 and P3.  Pro placement is not trivial on the first pitch, but it's all there, if you seek it out.  Classic, one not to be missed.

    This crack is probably by far one of the most exciting and thrilling in all of Eldorado Canyon.  5.7+ is a good rating, a standard rack with plenty of cams will do you just fine.  The first ten feet or so of the second pitch has a small roof and can be somewhat tricky if you don't have much experience with roofs.  But overall very good climb and worth climbing.

    There is no way the first pitch is 5.8. I would rate it at a 5.7-, but it was pretty wet when I climbed it. I can see how if you climb it wrong it could be harder. It is a step from a big stance at the bottom of the flake, to good feet and nice holds.  Pitch 3 is the crux and went at easy 5.7, it is really short with big holds all over and really good gear whenever you want.     I took 1 set of cams to #2 Camalot w/ doubles in green, yellow and red Aliens, and about 5 stoppers. I  wish I would have had a lot of big stoppers, some hexs and 1 set of cams from green Alien to #1 Camalot. It would be fun to climb this with just nuts and hexs and I'm definitely going to do that next time.    A fun route and a must do, I can see why it gets so much traffic.

    Lots of gear on 4th pitch!  My partner and I got into a jam last night when we ran out of light and had foolishly left our headlamps at home.  Because of this, our cleaning of the 4th pitch was hurried and whoever is the first to climb it today (Saturday, October 8th) will find some decent pieces.  Of that person wishes to trade those piece for some tasty beer and good karma, please call Ryan @ 303.746.5643 and I will happily pick them up.  Also, the days are getting shorter so don't forget your headlamps, even if you leave the house in the early afternoon, by the time you wait for a couple of parties and get going, it gets dark fast.  Thanks again to the guys who were kind enough to lower us a headlamp from the top (we had made it to within 50 feet of the summit when I decided not to break an ankle trying to lead out in pitch darkness).  Thanks!  Oh yeah, great route of course, I thought the crux was the 3rd pitch and that is is 5.7, but it's old school Eldo 5.7 for sure.

    Hi guys, I'm sure I'm not as good a climber as most of you are, but I just redid the Bastille Crack a day before Bastille day, and I couldn't disagree more with your comments.  I first did it in June of 1975, and have done it a few times since.  It still seemed no harder than a 5.6 to me, maybe minimal 5.7.  The first pitch isn't any greasier than I remember it .  I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  It is a great climb, but it's not that hard.

    Did this one last Saturday.  I'd say P1 goes at 5.8 due to the glassy like finish on the rock.  Also, I recommend the 5.8 variation on the last pitch.  I'm guessing a red Alien would have fit nicely at the crux (last move of the climb), which of course I didn't have because it disconnected from me somehow while I was fiddling with gear.  Thus, Larry's red Alien took a ground fall.  RIP red Alien, you were badly missed :( .  The green Alien I used was just barely cammed.  At the crux, just remember you have good feet, just keep moving them up!

    I climbed the Bastille Crack again last weekend with my buddy Rob, who taught me to climb 22 years ago. We were the second party on Saturday morning. The first party was from Illinois, and they were great guys enjoying a week in the Rockies. At the bottom of the third pitch, the belayer offered to wait and let us pass on the fourth pitch, because we were climbing a bit faster than them. We took him up on the offer, I gave them a little beta on avoiding rope drag on the last pitch, and climbed quickly. A beautiful day, a classic climb, friendly climbers. Wouldn't it be great if we could all treat each other like these guys treated us?

    Let's remember that at one point in time, there was no such thing as a 5.11.  This used to be a .6 out of a possible .10.  It now gets a 5.7 rating because we all love Eldorado and it's own personal stiff rating system.  Sure I'll lead .11d at sport park.  But I'm still shut down above .10a at Eldo.  That's just the way the cookie crumbles.   We are using the "Yosemite decimal system".  Try leading the first pitch of "After Six" in Yosemite Valley.  This pitch used to be considered 5.6, and it now gets the 5.7 rating.  This Pitch is also WAY harder and more sustained than anything on Bastile.  Make sure to use an extra long sling at the starting flake,  I had a cam walk all the way up and out of my ownership.Having at least three 1"+/- pieces extra at the main ledge before p4 makes the anchor simpler.  There are several bomber placements in this range at this belay.  A 50m rope will get you to the top from here if you watch the rope drag(long slings).All things aside, I love this route.  A great way to shake off the cobwebs after winter.

    The Ernie Port photo shows the step across from the flake to the crack on P1 for those curious about the part that became greasier after the 80s. Newer leaders, be sure you slot this crack before committing but don't immediately slot a backup higher above you, IMO - you might need the room and the crux goes rather quickly; this has been the scene of far too many accidents.

    THE classic. The queues don't form for the access reason alone. Consider that many only do P1 but this designation is for the entire route. On the rating, the old 5.6 was before a general consensus. The 5.8 rating (Rossiter, 1989) was before it became ultra-polished. It was down-graded to .7 but after a many-year hiatus I am astonished at how polished a route can become and believe a return to .8 is justified for the hardest move on P1 with the variation on P2 being 8-. Expect more Eldo routes to show similar signs of wear.

    I climbed the Bastille with my 5 year old son last week and it was great. When climbing with little kids (if anyone other than me does?) the hard part is actually the 5.4 part of the climb because of the reach.

Kids might do better on the Werk Supp route, I will let you know later this week!

    Climbed it this weekend and got to lead the whole thing b/c my partner had already led it a few times.  I think it's a stellar climb.  I'm a 5.7/5.8 leader and found it challenging.  Tricky moves throughout.  Started at about 9 am.  Nobody waiting at the bottom, and pretty much had the climb to ourselves.  The infamous slippery P1 wasn't slippery, and the pro was just fine.  Still probably a good idea to be very cautious at the bottom of the P1 crack b/c a fall from there could be bad.  Really bad if your pro pulls.  I didn't find a slippery section on the whole climb.  I think because the rock was still cool (no sweaty hands) and the route hadn't had any traffic yet that day.  Tried the 5.8 variation at the top of P2 but didn't quite get it.  Couldn't turn the corner from the lower traverse to the right-facing side of the flake.  Seemed like the only way to do it was to pull a big lieback, but I was too pumped by the time I tried that, and ended up falling and heading up the standard route.  Can anybody offer some beta on this move?  Cool route everyone.  A must do.

    Climbed the Bastille Crack for the first time yesterday afternoon.  I've climbed at Eldorado for several years now and have finally gotten the chance to climb Bastille Crack (there is always a line at the base of it).     Polished, dirty, lots of lost gear, pigeon crap, and usually a line of people on it. The canyon is much too big to wait for this route to open up.
    Apr 5, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The climb has gotten harder, at least since I moved here in 1995- slicker, more polished, etc.  So I don't know how it was in 1960 or whatever, but I guess I expect some upgrading. For what it's worth, I'd give it 5.7 right now. As I recall, the rating was boosted to keep tentative leaders at the 'real 5.7 grade' away because they kept falling off of the start, which was not protected well by most 5.7 leaders cruxing there. Other climbs, such as Grand Giraffe have seen similar action. I've done it maybe 4X, once every few years since 1995 and each time it seems slicker than the last.  Once it starts getting slick, people start slipping more, and the slippery slope of schmarm speeds along. Grand Giraffe is harder than it was.  10a is fair.  Plus, 10a is usually easier than 9+ anyway. As for T2, you all know that the starting flake fell off right?  That the past crux hold does not exist, and that the ground below has eroded?    Now I'm not an old guy, and I 'never was' so calling me 'washed-up' or a 'has been' is quite a stretch. SO I guess I'll be considered objective here?  Nah- I'll get labeled something or another by whoever, according the their agenda. So here's my take on it. I agree that in many cases the grades got softer. Some of this because certain climbs got much easier with the advent of sticky rubber, and others because of gear/protection options. Maybe when the average 5.9 got easier, but a good solid crack climb, (were rubber and pro are not relevant did not change), the grade on that moved by comparison and got 'harder.'  Maybe only 20% of all routes really changed, so the system moved to upgrade 20% not downgrade 80%? Maybe that's why I can climb hard cracks but thin face hurts me?    As for grades on other routes, particularly 'modern' or 'new wave' free climbing grades. I suspect there is some element of ego from previous sandbaggers and current mercy-graders.  I'm certainly not feeling any stronger than 10 years ago, but seem to climb more hard routes despite somewhat frail health.  So what can I say?  The times change and I'm still having fun.  That sums it up.

    If this climb were rated solely for "maximum ego improvement" it would be 5.12 by now!    Sometimes the difficulty of a climb CAN change over time.  Holds may break off, or become slick with repeated use.  I'm not sure if this has occurred on this particular climb (I didn't climb it in the 60s or 70s) but it's something to consider.  I don't believe the individual rating of a climb is important except as compared to other climbs.

    Just FYI, the 1967 guide rates the Bastille 5.6, Calypso 5.5, Tagger 5.8, Vertigo 5.10, Ruper 5.7, Grand Giraffe 5.8, T2 5.9 etc.etc. I guess 5.6 isn't what it used to be.

    Instead of the normal 5.4 chimney section of the last pitch (about 1/2 way, after gaining the huge sloping ledge), consider the next giant dihedral to right.  It offers an offwidth and some crack/face climbing.  It goes at 5.7 and is more consistent with the grade for the previous 3 pitches.  Also, more fun in my opinion.

    While passing this route on our way to the upper west side of the Bastille recently I spotted a young woman really struggling to work out the beginning of the crack.  I noticed her leader had combined P1 &amp; P2.  I'd be curious how this situation worked out.  I suggest when leading this route, and combining 1 &amp; 2 or any long routes close to the stream, especially with inexperienced climbers, bring 2-way radios.  Otherwise, you'll be sitting up on that ledge waiting and waiting, unable to hear or see your partner, until finally forced into an assumption which can lead to an accident. Be careful out there!

    First, this is a frickin' damn good climb.  Second, I think that there are many reasons that warrant giving this route a 5.7 c/d S (V) grade, although it can be done 5.6 C1.  The traverse to gain the crack on the first pitch is frickin' hard: the crux move requires technical stemming and finger locking and the feet have been super-greasy ever since some ignoramus decided to use some old motor oil instead of chalk to "tic" the holds.  There is also groundfall potential because you must wait till you gain the crack to place gear lest the throngs of watching climbers and gapers will think that you are a miserable coward that barely deserves to slave away at belaying a sportie at Table Mountain let alone climb THE Bastille Crack.  I'd recommend a stick clip to pre-place gear in the crack in case you get gripped up there.  After that, its pretty much a cake walk unless you get your haul bag stuck.  If this happens or another party slows you down, the ledge at P3 is a good place to bivy.  After completing the climb, a tricky 3.9 sportaneering gully with difficult route-finding must be descended in order to get back to your car.

    The variation at the top of pitch two is definitely the way to go for if you're up for it.  Its easier than Reggae only in that it is shorter.  Technically it feels about the same as it has the layback thing going at 5.8.  It protects at the bottom of the flake with a big cam; #9 Metolius.

    Led the route today and felt P1 to be solid (7) with one polished hold on the crack. Maybe a half grade higher because its a little slippery. But what difference does it make, splitting hairs over a (7) climb? Definitely test your mettle on P2 and take the flake to the right (8) before the belay ledge (lay it back and smear). On the last pitch read Matt Bauman's description above and go for it.  That way is the right way, for the Bastille finale, in my opinion.

    This is a good place to sit in the shade and watch all the beginner epics. "well protected 5.7+ crack - I can do that - I once led a 5.9 in the gym with no falls". In case there is not enough amusement with the Bastille Crack you can also watch the antics on Werk Supp. Apparently, this is a good place to toprope (either the Bastille, Northcutt, Werk Supp, March of Dimes, etc) because it seems everyday someone is blocking the upper pitches with a beginner toprope session.  While you might find this amusing to watch be sure to stand back because at least one gumby will drop something or pull on a loose rock. It can even be exciting (or horrifying) to watch as the beginners sketch out because the crack is different (ie Eldo-type) then the one they practiced placing pro in and they place nothing that will stay put or hold a big fall. I guess it is easier to make enough money to buy a rack then to learn how to use any of it safely. eek. Somehow it makes me feel better and more relaxed to watch people on the NW Corner, Hair City, Outer Space, even Jules Verne. At least they know what they are doing. CB

    On the photo, the short traverse out right on P2 I believe is 5.8, though I could be wrong - when I've done the route, I've continued up and slightly left following easy climbing instead of going right around that flake.

    Casey Bernal - Although it should be obvious, I thought it must be said here too. Most of the guidebooks state explicitly to place pro in the flake and crack in P1 before stepping into them. There have been several ground falls here. This is one of the most spectacular 5.7 climbs around. Enjoy.

    If you think wider is better, try doing the "move left down the ledge and go up a corner system" pitch one pitch too soon (where you're clearly supposed to do the finger crack).  You'll soon find yourself in a short awkward flared chimney with a piton near the top that exits onto the ledge just below the normal P4 anchor.  Probably 7+ or 8 compared with some of the chimneys at Lumpy.

    I agree with the 5.7 rating.  The only way I could see the first pitch being 5.8 is if you don't have a long reach. Those of us 6 foot or better do have an advantage. I've done it several times as it is one of my favorites.  I also agree with the third pitch around the double cracks being more difficult than the first pitch, but only for a few moves.

    I agree with George (by the way, your site is one of my faves George), the slick beginning of the crack seemed harder than 5.7 (Id say 7+). Also, a GREAT variation to the final pitch (avoiding the easy chimney) is to step right and head for the HUGE left facing dihedral with a wide crack....climb wide crack for ~10 feet and then take finger crack that angles up and left, becomes straight up and then opens to hands as it angles back right to the top of the dihedral.....GREAT 5.8 finish to this classic climb.

    This route was originally rated 5.6 in the old Ament guide. I won't say it's that easy but if you stem between the crack and the edge of the flake to the right and than cross left at the top it's much easier than 5.8. Done this way the crux actually seems to be 3rd short pitch.

    Tried this route today and I have to agree on the Bomb rating, mainly because of the lack of pro and the large detached flake.  Also it may very well be closer to an 'x', at least the way we did it.  On lead I got forced left from the top of the flake (5.9)  because of the lack of pro, in my opinion, the flake will come off if you fall on the nuts or cams you place behind it.  Above that there is no pro till you get to the third pin if you go right from the top of the flake (.10). If you go straight up from the top of the flake it's probably 9+ but again there is very little in the way of good pro till you get to the third pin.  Never did see the angle piton but it is probably hidden in the grass off to the left someplace.

    Well...Seeing people rate a route this badly, I just had to go try it.  On TR though, given the death flake warnings.  First off, I only found 3 of the pins. Second of all it seemed S but not VS.  The 50 pound block loose on top of the death flake was removed with benevolence it now lies 6 meters right of the base of Werks Supp.  The remaining flake will easily hold a climber, but I wouldn't take a big fall on a cam behind it...    The rest of the route was OK. Tricky to lead? Yes.  Sandbagged? Yes.  Minus two stars?  Not that bad. There are numerous hidden holds that bring this into reality.

    Rob set the bolts for this with Matt on TR.  When he led it with me belaying, the bolt studs were in, but he carried a bag of hangers and a wrench. So, as he got to each bolt, he slapped on a bit of glue, installed the hanger, then clipped the bolt.  Pretty fun methodology.  There was also a two-bolt belay (at a shelf close to the end of P2 of BC) that made this a great, long pitch.  At the height of the bolt wars, this belay and protection bolt for the upper section were excised.  The climb now  joins 'Wide Country' instead of continuing up.

I balked numerous times over the course of many minutes but finally wiggled in a #2 BD stopper and 000 C3 and did the moves. Pretty decent distance above the pin without this gear.

    I first did the DNF around 1978 when I followed Rich Goldstone up it. Rich also led me up Rain which seemed pretty bold in that pre-cam period.    Did the first pitch yesterday in much worse style. The approach was fine. Lots of gear, but a bit dicey at the bottom. The crux was frustrating. It looks pretty easy, but the problem is, I think, the holds, although in reach, are in the wrong places and the balance and sequence are difficult. After a few falls and hangs, I tightened my shoes and did it, only to get pretty scared on the easier ground. Got a tiny brass high (that later fell out) and moved far left. Good gear the rest of the way. The 10 finish seemed straightforward. Strong winds and dropping temperatures convinced us to abandon our plan to continue to the top.    The crux is a bit problematic for the second because a fall swings you far left. Next time I'll climb double ropes (as I did this time) and after the crux not clip the right hand rope until the end of the 10 finish. This should provide a good TR for the second.

    "So anybody want to name the climb, and where the RB initials are located on the climb??"    Steve - isn't it on Vertigo, and the intials are at the belay below the direct finish roof?  That's where I see those initials in my mind's eye, anyway.    You can send me a bag of your left-over halloween candy for a prize if I got it correct  :-)

    Here is the story as told by PA in High Over Boulder:"I was wearing a pair of big mountain boots which Cub Schaefer gave me to try out on rock. I was using a stretchy nylon rope I didn't trust, I was belayed by a 14 year old kid I wasn't sure could catch me, I had no chalk. I had to hammer in all the pitons climbers today have the benefit of clipping, and I managed to climb the 5.11 move my first try. Dalke told me he'd done the upper section of the dihedral free and that it wasn't much harder than 5.8. So when I got the hard moves, and as all of my assorted adversities began to wear me out, and giving myself the benefit of the doubt that I could--under normal circumstances--lead 5.8, I started resting on carabiners on relatively moderate moves. Perhaps I shouldn't have listed it as the ffa. When people complained that I had cheated or been dishonest or some such, I returned and climbed the pitch in much more exact style."    Also, Bob, I think you meant to type DH instead of DK.    The old days are fun to reminisce.    By the way, Steve, do you remember when and where we first met??

    2nd PITCH HAS LOST A FLAKE: Today (6/29/04), I fell about 15 feet above the belay on the 2nd pitch (variation to the right), and my two cams pulled off a medium-sized flake.  This was not the main undercling/lieback feature that you follow the the right, but a smaller undercling flake above the main one.  I don't believe it will affect the overall rating of the climb, as the route really goes to the right of the flake before traversing back left above it.  It does eliminate a couple of protection opportunities (which apparently weren't very good).  Fortunately, my partner and I only suffered minor abrasions and a good scare.  The flake landed in his lap, and is now sitting fairly securely on the ledge up and left of the belay.  I'd hate to thing what would have happened if that sucker had fell to the road!

    Sep 26, 2002

    I did the first pitch of this (Wide Country) the other day and I have to say that the section past the bolt is one of the hardest low-11's I've done at Eldo.  The 10ish section above at the overlap is exciting.  The 'hand-sized cam' that protects this section is a bit sketchy as it is wedged against a loose block.  However, the block doesn't flex, nor does it look like it's going anywhere.  One can back this piece up with a bomber yellow alien up and left (if you are tall enough to reach the placement).  An awesome pitch!

    Nice job, AC, on figuring out the 11a face move. I've only followed this pitch once and I didn't figure it out. I think the runout above this move is horrendously scary looking. I need to follow this pitch once move before I'd lead it.    On the second pitch, the key is matching on a small, insecure hold up and right. You get it with your right hand first, then delicately step up and match - very insecure. This move is hard, but not as baffling as the move on the first pitch. At least for me. I've led this second pitch before and followed it and haven't fallen off this move. If you fell three times, it must have been a descent fall since the gear is well below your feet as you reach for this ledge. How'd the fall turnout? Did you fall on the fixed pin or put in a higher RP?

    I climbed this yesterday and was able to figure out the (yes, very footwork intensive - look around for awhile to find the key nubbin) 11a crux of the first pitch - but ended up falling three times on the 10c crux (you can see the huge shelf but how the heck do you reach it!) of the second pitch!  Maybe I just couldn't figure out the moves, but it seemed a degree of magnitude harder then the 11a crux.

    For those who want to be more precise about their spice, the 10b crux on the second pitch is protected by the smallest rp I own.  Even with a screamer, I doubted it would hold.  The next piece down, a pin, is maybe 8-10 feet below your feet when you make the crux move.  Tom Isaacson

    Thanks to 3 recent sorties by members of the Action Committee for Eldorado, all old ring bolts are now removed, holes are pretty well camouflaged. Also, rings were added to the anchor at the bottom just in case anyone were to rap from there. FYI, those old ring bolts are a pain to remove. A Dremel tool with lots of batteries and lots and lots of fiber cutting wheels was the ticket, much easier than a reciprocating saw or hand saw. Pulling them out by force seems like a bad idea - forces are great enough to damage the rock.    Big thanks to Madaleine for replacing the ring bolts. A multi-year team effort hopefully resulted in a pitch that gets more attention now. And now that Madame Guillotine's bolts have been replaced, the epic 5.12 link-up is ready for all suitors!

    This is a great climb that is now a little harder due to one less hold before the crux.  I pulled off a flake about a foot long and 4" wide from the rotten band.  Judging from the chalk, I wasn't the only one to be using this hold.  Establishing on the headwall below the crux is still in the realm of 5.11+, you may just need to figure out new beta.                         I pulled off this bad boy from the rotten band a little above the kneebar rest.  The flake dangerously flexed when I used the crimp to help establish on the headwall before the crux.

    Also, maybe replacing the bolts is not all that necessary... I went out today with my friend Matt and sent this route sans bolts, all gear.

It actually felt easier this way, since you don't have to clip any bolts during the crux.    -Scott
    May 18, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Glad someone is replacing the bolts on this thing, those old ones are annoyingly hard to clip!     One question/concern though: I noticed there's a quicklink and rap ring on the new anchor bolt. Do you think the top anchor needs to be equipped for rapping? I can't really see any reason why you'd need to rap here, and if you're rapping in to approach the pitch, you can just hang a couple draws and retrieve them when you top out.   I guess my concern is that someone with limited knowledge of the route/area will see the anchors and attempt to rap down to the ground, which would be tough. I know the anchors are not super visible from the summit, so it probably won't be a problem, but there doesn't seem to be a reason for having them equipped for raps at all.    Again, thanks a ton for the volunteer work, I don't want to be negative, just thought I'd raise the question.  -Scott

    FYI:  I obtained a permit to re-bolt this route (the old bolts will be removed and new 1/2" bolts as close as is safe to the old holes).

Hopefully a new drill or battery pack will magically appear and the changing of the bolts may continue.

    A good way to set up for this route is to belay about one third of the way up the second pitch of Outer Space, below the start of the prominent dihedral.  This belay takes smallish gear, TCUs, nuts, etc.  From there, climb the dihedral on Outer Space with some long slings, and then cut left onto the bolts of Hairstyles and Attitudes.  Using this method you can take this pitch all the way to the top of the Bastille, and it's one of the best pitches in Eldo!
    Apr 9, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I assume you mean the belay at the start of the pitch?  I seem to remember not having too much trouble finding gear there... but we always approached by rapping in from above and setting up the anchor at a natural starting point just up and left from one of the Bastille Crack belays.    When I was working this route, one of my partners, who will remain unnamed and happened to be wearing my bright orange down jacket, had to relieve himself while I was climbing.  Despite my protests he proceeded to urinate right into the Bastille Crack.  A few days later I walked into the BRC and a few staff members jokingly chided "way to go pissing all over the most popular climb in Boulder last weekend!"    "It wasn't me!  I swear!"

    This route would see way more traffic if it had belay anchors. It's a total pain to rig a belay, unless both climbers climb 12b/c and the second can remove all the crap. A big loose rock is in the way of your feet at the belay as well. It would drop straight down Bastille Crack.

    This is a worthwhile route for the obscure tour. I'd recommend bringing plenty of RPs and small nuts. I placed a #4 Camalot at the nest of slings in the bottom of the OW before starting the traverse. A baggy 0.5 or tight 0.75 fits okay at the crux. I was able to get a good green Alien right after that.

    So a few weeks ago someone told me that this was a great alternative first pitch to NW corner and that it had great gear ("good small wires"), so I got on it and got spooked.  What I found: There is a good purple Camalot right at the crux (didn't have it that day) but it's tough to place and it takes up a key hand hold making the crux harder (I felt) than most 10c's. A decent, purple TCU can be placed from the good stance before the crux and then that frees up the good hold.  Placing the "good small wires" the rest of the way is hard, best to just punch it.  Cool movement. There's a fixed wire/HB brassy on the route after the crux.

    Dougald, I saw you on it last weekend and Commented to my partner "Somebody's on Independent Study. I've never seen anyone else on that before."  I did it more or less straight up in 1996 with Mark Spieker, Done this way you just get bad stoppers in bad flakes, and only here and there. It's reminiscent of Marie Antoinette, but harder with some bad holds. I thought it was a scary 5.10c, maybe a few moves that were harder, for the sake of skipping suspect holds.

    On the first ascent of this pitch, I actually started from the second belay on XM, but instead of going straight right past a bolt, I followed the little arching corner up and right (part of the 5.9 XM variant Josh mentions above) and from its' end continued up and right across blank rock to meet the flake below the runout slab at its' bottom.  This makes a more independent and committing route than the one described, but overall about the same technical difficulty.  Rossiter's guide is correct.

    I followed this climb with my friend Joe yesterday.  We were doing the "spice tour".  What an incredible pitch!  I agree with the other comments that it is BOLD, but not death defying.  Yes, there are some huge runouts, but on moderate rock.  Leaving the belay and traversing over to the pin on NW corner is probably the spookiest section.  Besides the bolt at the start, there is no pro for quite a ways.  The runout below the crux would be very spicy on the sharp end, and yes, the loose hold is still there.  It kinda caught me off guard.  The crux section has bombproof gear about at your feet and  it's really only a couple hard moves of 11.  I guess I'll be on the sharp end next time.  This climb should definitely be on every hardman/woman's ticklist.  4 STARS!!
    May 28, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    While the runout is pretty serious, it is definitely more mental than really difficult.  I wouldn't say it was any harder than 10a.  Concerning the loose hold, it would be great if it was gone but I didn't feel like it was necessary to even go near it to finish the runout.  With that said... WOW, Holy Shit!  What an amazing pitch!
    Jun 3, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I thought this was sufficiently terrifying - I was more scared than on Jules Verne at least.    The loose hold on the run out is a serious disaster waiting to happen.  The hardest move of the run out (the actual crux comes later and is well protected) comes right before this hold - both my partner and I latched onto it and moved up to a better stance on it, only feeling it flexing after the fact.  Someone please go up there and knock the thing off - preferably while seconding.    Also, Rossiter's topo is misleading on this climb for three reasons. First, if you start this from the anchors atop Wide Country, you traverse almost straight right past a bolt, not up into the 5.9 variation of XM as shown. Second, there isn't an 11a S move near the top of the NW Corner piton crack as shown. Third, the run out is definitely more serious than 9+ S as shown.    The climbing is pretty darn good though!  A long, sustained, and interesting pitch.

    Great pitch!    Single rack of finger and maybe doubles on 1.    I placed a #2 (not great) and a 0.75 (bomber) before the crux runout, number 1 would have been better.

    I fell a good ways several times onto a red C3 in the green Alien placement mentioned above. I bent the $&amp;%# out of it. I recommend either a flexible cam, like an Alien, or just going with the red C4 that's about a foot below that (I tested the red C4, it's good!).    The beginning is a little scary, and I did a lot of traversing around. It looks like there are two possible ways to go, and of course the other way looks easier than the way you are attempting at the time... a little sketchy. You have to pull a "5.7" move (think the crux of the Bastille Crack) with no gear about fifteen-twenty feet above a bad landing.

    Stellar climbing that seems to go on forever!  This must have been 100 feet to the anchors and none of it boring.  While this might be R rated for the first thirty feet (and it's only 5.7 there), after that it is safe with only the chance for a long, clean fall.  Another Eldo gem.

    Jun 8, 2006

    This is probably my favorite pitch on the Bastille -- classic Eldo.  I think the only R section is the easy climbing early on.  While a fall from the upper face/crux (before slinging the flake) could be big, it would also be nothing but air, in fact, I actually think it is a great pitch to push one's mental barriers on lead.    The second photo of Rob Kepley leading shows the location of the green Alien or similar piece (his highest piece), but one should also note that gear to back it up (a green or red camalot) can be had underneath the flake he's standing on.

    Kerr, ditto Tony B above. 3 variations for P1 start, and if you want good pro, there are at at least 3 good placements on the left start before moving up into the left-leaning crack; a micronut then a TCU under the left-arcing overhang, then another good placement at the base of the crack itself before committing. If you start up and move right a little traversing across the 5.11 start, there's a great right kneebar to help you hang out to place and rest before the moves into the crack.    Bolt anchors at top of P3. No more need to build a weird gear anchor.

    Warmed up on the first pitch. There isn't much gear until after the crux. However I was able to wiggle in one of the smaller BD micronuts a little ways below the obvious wide spot in the thin crack. If you start on the far right, get to the good stance, and look around the corner, you can put in a blue TCU and extend it, then traverse left to the get to the sort of decent micronut placement. If you do slip at the crux and the nut comes out, you may just skim the ground instead of completely decking. This would also be nice for your follower, so they don't swing. Can't wait to go back and do the rest!

    I really enjoyed all three pitches of this route!  It was the first time I've ever done the first two pitches, and while they don't warrant classic status, they've got some fun, thoughtful climbing on them.  The third pitch I hadn't climbed in more than 25 years, and it was as good as I remember!

    Here's how this route breaks down:    P1: 5.9. Ascend the right side of MoD Buttress via the right of two cracks. Small pro until the hand crack is gained. Belay at chains. 75 ft.  P2: 5.10a. Scramble through easy terrain to an obtuse corner. Finger-sized cams. Lieback, stem and reach right to gain the top of the corner. Head right slightly to belay below the diagonal crack. 125 ft.  P3: 5.10c. Climb the crack! Excellent movement... too bad it's so short. Great pro. Belay at top of crack from a BOLT ANCHOR.     Descend to the east. 10min. back to base.    Good route.... Would definitely be best to link with Werk Supp for a great route.

    The offwidth (5.7) above the crux finger crack makes a great continuation to this climb. I didn't find the rope drag to be very bad. I didn't have any pieces bigger than a BD #1, but I was able to get in some gear on the face and sling a chockstone in the offwidth. There were plenty of face hold inside and outside the offwidth too.    Finishing MOD by climbing the offwidth corner to the top of the Bastille felt much more fulfilling to me, try it!

    The last pitch is a great link up with the first two pitches of Werk Supp. It's pretty spicy near the top of the finger crack, but the gear is great so it is well protected. I followed this route a few weeks ago and wasn't too fond of it, but after leading it today, I realized how great this line actually is.

    Substitute P2 of Werk Supp, and you've got a great line!  Regarding P3--stemming out left toward the top as soon as you can will ease the difficulty and keep it more in the .10c range. Also, do what you can to downclimb/rappel 'softly', so as not to add to the soil erosion on the descent line.

    TR'd the first pitch yesterday, I tried several different variations to get ready to lead this thing.  I went from the left up the red rock band and from the right up a thin crack.  I also tried straight up but this was too tough.  However, the crux from whatever direction was moving onto the face with the left leaning crack.  If this is 5.9 then its the hardest 5.9 i've ever done!  I'd say the easiest variation on the first pitch goes at 10a with less than bomber protection right off the ground.  With that said its still a very fun route with some cool moves.

    Got spanked off of this climb yesterday, can anyone comment on where the 5.9 start is thats in the route description for P1?  I went up the brown band to the left to the left leaning crack but couldn't get a solid piece in so I ended up bailing out.  Whats the easiest variation on P1?  Is there really a 5.9 variation?

    The first and last pitches are good The last pitch takes small gear, i.e. blue Alien, #1 Metolius TCU and FCU, small stoppers.  My buddy built an anchor using medium cams downhill from the top of the last pitch.  The last pitch felt right at  5.10c.

    I led the first two pitches of Werk Supp to the crux of MoD. This combo is stellar.    P2 of Werk Supp can be combined with this crux, although that may have been my downfall, as I was pumped by the time I got to the crux.     Tricky feet and crimpy hands up high. Used small nuts and Yellow and Green aliens (equiv. to BD 0.3, 0.2 I think), the latter of which held multiple lead falls before I figured out the sequence. My partner, Mike Flanagan flashed it though. The belay atop is weird. Sling a root, good BD #2, poor BD#3 (would have been better with bigger cam).

    Does anyone climb the second pitch of this? Supposedly 5.8. Yesterday I had a harder time following the second pitch than leading the crux third pitch. Pitch 2 is a left leaning left facing dihedral with a blank and dirty left wall. Two short but strenuous sections of laybacking a wide finger crack. Above that is easier runout climbing.
    Oct 20, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There are actually several possibilities for the first pitch- the first comment gives directions for the 11a variation and talks about going all over- I thought the 11a just fired right up the crack- no left, no right, just up. After the first crack (11a) runs out you can still go more or less straight up (10b). For another variation, you can come in from the lower left up the brown band on well-spaced jugs and then up the left-leaning crack above that. This can be done without stepping out right to the face and instead go right up into the thin crack up high (10b/c)- it protects with small cams and can be backed-up with a so-so 2.5" piece, although that gets in the way a little of the crux hold, it can be done.Further- you can go directly up the blunt arete way out on the right all the way to the top (10b) and the chains. This way is runout.

    Doing the last pitch of this route as a finish to Werk Supp was too fun.  But I changed the grade to 5.8 A1 by hang dogging it.  I was surprised and happy to find better feet than expected.  It looked barren of foot placements, but that was'nt the case.  I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that you didn't have to go all the way to the roof to traverse to the finish.    A note on the pro at the top.  I placed a #2 Camalot around the corner above the crux, then went back down and place a yellow Alien above the crux for my 2nd.  For the belay, I slung a wedged rock near the cam (the cam I ran the rope through to keep a fall from being directly on me).  I also slung a root down low in the wide crack that looked like it would have held fine.  From this description, you can tell I didn't read about this route before doing it and had left the #4 Camalot down below for protection...

    Pitch 3 of this route is a good way to end Werks Up, just don't leave all the big pieces you brought for pitch 2 of Werks Up at the belay like I did or your anchor will be sheit.  I have pretty meaty fingers and found the last move to be pretty stout for the grade, cool pitch though..
    Aug 17, 2002

    Agreed, Charles, I try to remember to bring a #3 (or #3.5?) Camalot for the belay at the top of P3.  I think it fits perfectly, and will make your second (and you) feel a lot better as he cranks the final moves.
    Jun 28, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The crux is a nice looking face with a typical Eldo-type crack. It sunk some great nuts but using micro cams would be weird - the nuts were just too good. We only used a green Alien until the top where we used a yellow as a directional. For the crux section we had a bomber #4 stopper then a #5 (the #5 held a fall). This crux might be a little harder if you have large fingers as it is a small crack - I had trouble fishing in my pinky tips in some places. Beautiful face too bad it wasn't longer than 30 feet.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    The belay anchor after the P3 crux is real funky.  There is a decent root you can tie-off, but otherwise you might need big cams (at least #3 friend, but an OW piece would work in the wide crack), or you may need to reach back into the crux crack and place a couple small pieces to back up the root.  Continuing up the wide crack presents heinous rope drag.
    Jul 19, 2001

    The 11a alternate start is highly recommended. Start about six feet to the left of the 5.9 start at a thin crack which starts about 5 feet off the ground and runs for about 8 feet.     Step up and place small nuts as high as possible. Clipping directly to the nuts is recommended. Move left and up diagonally to the right to regain the top of the thin crack. From here move slightly right and continue with the remainder of the first pitch.

    Yeah, the first bolt of M.G. can be reached for and clipped prior to the rising traverse here, but there are still no bolts on it.  And also agreed that the RPs I placed (actually H.B. "Anchors" and B.D. "Copper-Steel") were most useful without the bolt and perhaps not needed if that is what you are going to do, but I thought at least one of them would have held.  Then again, I don't fall much, and I could be wrong about that.  Not falling is by far the best option and going after a lead like this at one's limit would be fool-hardy at best.

    John Ruger and I made what we thought was the FFA sometime in the '70s.  I'd had the opportunity to check the route out on rappel and made some custom small wires and wire slings to protect the route.  Ruger led the first pitch in fine form on minimal gear, and I crept across the traverse with a few points of protection, including a fixed RURP.  There were no bolts in place.  I've never been back.

    Agreed that this should be considered "X" rated. I reached out right to clip the first bolt on "Madame Guillotine", and didn't get any pro until the bolt ~20-30' later. Definite groundfall potential on some 5.9 terrain.     I think I saw the RPs Tony was talking about, they're to the left of the line and I didn't place them because my last piece (the MG bolt) was down and to my right. Either way, the RPs didn't look great. You should probably be comfortable soloing Eldo 5.9 face climbing before getting on this one.    -Scott

    I climbed this on Friday 7/6 and got in a bomber red Alien at the top of the finger crack but didn't see any other gear till I was in the rock band where the bolt is located.  The Alien protects the crux mantle as I slipped there and tested it out first hand.  But after the mantle you don't want to fall since the ground is the only thing that's going to stop you at that point.
    Jul 9, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    It might be in the range of 20' from the ground, but you can definitely fish in some small nuts/brassies near the line.  I believe I got 3(?) pieces in there just before the balance-crux of the pitch.  Maybe this was not immediately apparent, but there are placements that should hold a fall.  My memory is faded, as we're talking a few years ago, but it seems they were in a seam on the right-hand side of the feature you are climbing and they are pumpy to place.  Yeah, you could &amp; probably would get hurt in a fall, but I don't think that it's a necessary grounder or career-ender.

    Hmmm, each time I've led this a fixed ring-angle or bolt  about thirty or forty feet up is the first piece of gear. This  is on easy ground after the crux.

    Got on this route yesterday. I recommend keeping a red Alien or two for the traverse as I was sketched out on techy, lichenous feet with a piece that prob wouldn't hold a fall when my last bomber piece was 15 - 20' left on Werks Supp. I was confused when I got to the bolt on Madame Guillotine, cuz I thought you're supposed to continue right to Bastille (which looked sketchy). My partner followed this way. To offer her a little pro, I ended up lowering off the bolt, traversing a rail to the bastille and running it out maybe 60 feet so the 1st piece on that route would give some sort of top rope pro instead of forcing a penji whipper to the right on follow. A little strange, but it worked fine. I recommend just sacking up and going straight up the bolts on the 11 pitch to the typical gear anchor atop Bastille P2. Continued into Outer Space for a good, spicy, continuous 10+ / 11- route up the Bastille.
    Oct 18, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a cool way to start a "barber pole" girdle traverse of the Bastille. From Bastille Crack P2, continue on the traverse to Outer Space, but instead of heading up the well-chalked dihedral, continue right on strata to join a dihedral on XM. Take this to the Outer Space ledge, and then continue around the ledge to the West Face and summit from there.    You could probably start further left still, somewhere on March of Dimes, for the longest traverse.    There's not too much shade in Eldo in the summer, we've got to maximize all the climbable surface on the Bastille!

    Delicate, thin bits at the crux, yes, but with the piton and good pro just before and after it, it totally goes. Full-on technical bits, definitely not strengthy. So being 5'3" at best, and in Eldo, I'm quite rather surprised by the 5.10"d" rating. Especially since the entire bit to the crux is smooth jammin' and restful climbing (because I'm definitely not an Eldo 5.10 leader, and I've backed off Eldo 5.9s harder than this).

    Luckily I didn't have to test the ring piton on this climb yesterday, but the party below me took a fall on it and it held.  From what I've read, that piton must have held thousands of falls over the years.  Great short climb nonetheless.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I'd say it's all 5.7 to 5.8 except for the crux move.  BTW, it CAN be done without the mystery foothold.  You just have to place your left foot really high and hang from the sidepull in the dihedral with your left hand while reaching around the corner for a pinky and ring finger lock in the crack.  Then grunt and send.  This worked for me (but my partner swore it wouldn't 'til I did it:)  Might not work if you're short.  I'm 5'10"

    The pin is still good, but doesn't really come into play if you put one of your smallest cams in the pocket a few inches to the left, the pocket isn't really essential for the move. I placed a tiny gray TCU, and it fit easily with space on either side.

    You can do a variation at the top of the climb.  Rather than traverse right at the pin, continue up the ever thinning crack to the anchor.  Not much protection for the leader.  On a TR it felt about 5.11b.

    Adendum to the historical note.  This was the first 5.10 in Colorado, and very possibly the first in America.  Not only was Northcutt sandbagged into doing it in 1959, there wasn't another 5.10 done in Colorado until well into the sixties.  I do support the 10d rating.  The "trick" is a tiny foot cup stemming right onto the arete, two inches below a small upside down triangular lip.
    Aug 24, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I find 10d to be a suitable grade, considering the first 30 feet are no harder than 8+, and the crux is so short.  Even if the ring pin did pull/break, the pin below it is great and the gear options below that even better (.75 Camalot).  Also, I find this pitched linked with P2 of the Bastille into Outer Space to be a good warm up to the X-M/Outer Space link-up:  the difficulties are similar, only difference is the quality of gear.
    Aug 1, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Well, if you're wondering what Eldo 11- feels like, try this. I didn't get the route, but I can say, in case you're wondering, that the old ring pin (circa 1959??) will hold. At least, as of this morning it held two pretty good whippers from around the corner (and three smaller ones too!). Yes, I made it past the crux and around onto the 'good' slopers and came off. Nonetheless, this is a beautiful route and it is a shame the first part of it doesn't go on for another 100'.
    Jul 20, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I love the story of the first free ascent.  Ray Northcutt, who must have been strong as an ox since he could do 100 pullups, was incorrectly told that Layton Kor had freed the direct start to the Bastille Crack.  Upon learning this, Northcutt went out the next day and fired the line, only later learning that his was indeed the FFA.      I think this is generally acknowledged to be a bona fide 5.11- pitch nowadays, and when you consider that it was nearly a decade later that Ament, et al. were being credited with climbing the "first" 5.11 routes in the U.S., it serves to emphasize Northcutt's achievement on this short route, as well as the powerful impact one's mindset can have on climbing performance.      Free your mind...

    First of all, "Climberz" stated that he "heard" a story about someone ripping gear and thus assumed he took a 40' fall.

As of Dameeser's gear recommendation, he is simply giving a suggestion on gear he used and I TESTED. I tested this gear myself, did everything I could to rip it out, and could not. Dameeser was actually in favor of putting the bolt, I was not, so that is why I tested the bujeezus out of his placements, so that I could convince him NOT to put in an application to bolt the route. We were on the route that day volunteering for ACE to test the safety now that the pins are gone. We posted our report on ACE's facebook page, with pictures of the placements and told the community to think about the placements, the route, and to leave suggestions.    Dear team, please note the gear recommendations are NOT A STANDARD ELDO RACK. Like, who on Earth has an offset blue/purple Master Cam? haha, I don't.

    'looked good'    Fantastic. What a sterling recommendation of gear placements. What will it take to convince you, Dameseer? Someone ripping the full pitch and breaking their ankles? Their neck? It's great that you, who have probably had to redpoint that pitch previously, now has the pitch wired and can do it without testing that gear. It's great but also irrelevant to the conversation.    The bottom line is that pin was bomber when it placed. It was bomber many years later. However, it is gone now. The original character of the route is defined by bomber protection in that location. It is only a continuation of the past to continue to have bomber gear in that location. Let's put a bolt in that will last a long time.    This coming from a guy who has whipped on that pin after a red c3 that 'looked good' ripped.

    Without the pins on the 2nd pitch, the nature of this route has certainly changed. It's heads up now. I climbed it in Feb. 2017, and I placed a green Alien, an offset blue purple Master Cam, and a green c3 all right where the pin broke, just before the crux. You have to run it out to the bolt, because the pin scars won't take any gear. Sure, if the gear rips, it's going to be a big fall, just with any gear route, but the green Alien and offset Master Cam that I placed looked good.

    Climbed this super route again today. A couple notes - I used a yellow (0.2) BD X4 on the  placement at the base of the P2 crux below the bolt.

    Hey Bob, I climbed the route last summer not knowing that there was ever a pin protecting the upper part of the thin crack, and it felt pretty safe. I placed several pieces just below the crack and gunned it through the crux to the bolt. As you say, placing protection in the seam would be strenuous, and honestly, I didn't see any great options. The fall would be pretty big if you came off towards the top of the crack, but I believe it would be safe. The cams below the crack are very good placements.
    May 31, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Did this today and found the top pin that protected the straight up thin crack version and has been there for 15 plus years is missing. I always thought it looked pretty solid, but I see in a post above that it came out when someone was cleaning the pitch. I don't doubt that it has been fallen upon many times in the past, but over the years with freeze thaw, these things can loosen.    This seemed to me, at the time, that it changes the route quite a bit from when the pin was there. I am in a climbing recovery mode and not really on my game right now, but it seemed like It adds quite a bit more commitment, since that pin used to be quite high in the crack and close to waist level when doing the crux. The crack is pretty flaring in this section, I couldn't get anything good passive pro in up high in the crack, plus it's a very strenuous place to try and place anything, which was the reason why the pin was there to begin with. Getting any good gear in high in the crack, where the pin was, would be difficult if possible at all. You can get a green Alien in just above the existing pin. Seems to me it would be good if some one replaced the pin that feel out. That would return this route to its previous, more friendly character. Or maybe it's not that bad, just not what I was expecting?    08/17/16 update:  Now the other pin that was there that was below the green Alien placement I mention above has broken. Part of the pin is still in the crack. I know some may not agree with me, but I am just sayin' what was once a pretty friendly and safe climb, with the pins there, has a much higher commitment and risk factor now.

    I think I do this different than everyone else. First, the XM start is much nicer and adds another 10 pitch to the climb.    On the crux, I climb over the tiny roof and get my left hand in the good slot between the two pins in the crack. Then I reach out with my left foot and toe in on a tiny edge (out left) and balance forward on that while moving my left hand high and right hand to a gaston in the crack above the pins. My left hand hits a high edge and I pop my feet up and move to better holds right under the bolt. Clip the bolt and move right.    Voila

    Good to hear Steve Levin's comment on how the 3rd pitch has become more difficult to reach the fixed pin since removal of the block.  Felt scary trying to lock off on one arm, heel hook, and stretch up to the pin just to find my Superfly biner wouldn't fit through the hanger, as I was hanging above sharp loose rocks... maybe there's an easier way to do it (?).

    P1/P2  can be linked. From atop p2, a ~65m pitch goes to the summit. I thought that the crux, if climbed straight up, then rightward (long reach to pin scar and desperate pull) felt harder than 5.11a. My partner worked right and then up (past one more pin and another new bolt) and said it felt less strenuous.

    Instead of trending right on the last pitch into the 5.7 finish, do the Outer Face pitch (see separate route listing). This pitch keeps the grade more consistent with the rest of the route and allows you to really follow the prow from base to summit. Good fun.

    I climbed this route yesterday and it is indeed a great route. On the 3rd pitch, mentioned above, I have some comments. First, the loose flakes are not where the pins are driven. These flakes seemed completely solid to me. Yes, the first pin is difficult to clip and have a small biner for this (Neutrinos work here). The loose flakes below this are a bit freaky but they can be avoided. This section is steep, but short and didn't seem too serious (if the pins hold and they seemed good to me).    The start of the crux pitch is a bit disgusting right now with pigeon shit. Thankfully this only lasts for about ten feet, but it sucks having to fist jam this crack with that shit in there.    I followed the crux pitch and fell off it. What worked best for me was to do the long reach left from the best hold in the crack. This hold is rather low. Then the key is to reach as far as possible on the hold out to the right. Not only is it a better hold the further you reach, but it gives you room to match your right hand on it. This match is by far the crux move on the route, but it is followed with a dicy move to get your foot on this hold and a fall from here would be exciting, though supposedly safe.
    Aug 29, 2002

    Now that I've  (FINALLY!) led  the  crux without a problem, I think this is a great route. Before it was negative-five stars. If  you're weak, like me, don't stint on gear for  the traverse from the bolt to the belay (assuming you've taken the left variation). You can clip the second bolt at your knees with a long sling. And be  sure to back up the pin at  the end. The exit is not trivial!

    Has anyone done this route in 2 pitches with a 60m.  Me and my partner came close the other day.  I lead the third, fourth and the easy chimney pitch above and right form the outer space ledge and came about 15 feet short form the top (walk-off ledge).  My partner belayed right after the .9 undercling roof after the crux, because of drag, but still had about 30 feet or so of rope left.  I, of course (on the crux pitch) did the easier variation to the right after the second pin which is a good option for someone following the pitch who wants to keep the climbing easier.  I remember staying in the crack the whole way when I did this last year (following) and remember getting really pumped and hanging quite a bit trying to find some decent feet.  Excellent route and mostly great 5.9 climbing except the crux 25-30 feet.

    That's usually done as the third pitch, and yes, be really careful on that shattered band.  Have a Petzl biner handy to clip the difficult pin.  Not a place to be pushing things, regardless of how one approaches the crux pitch...

    I climbed this route yesterday and loved it. I did however get pretty sketched out on the 3rd pitch when I pulled on a large flake in the 5.9 section and it moved. The pro at this point is a pin driven behind the same flake. I found it difficult to make the move without yarding straight out on the suspect flake. I also had a hard time clipping the pin just below this one because of the way it sits in the rock, I was standing on some loose strata trying to make this clip. I found the crux 2nd pitch to be very difficult and got spit off a few times but will return to try again since the pro is very good through this section. As Steve said, the fall is clean, I went slightly left after the last pin at the crux..
    Jun 13, 2002

    Fun Climb.  On the crux pitch, the traverse after the crux moves feels a little dicey, if you fall, you'll swing (but on a good bolt).  Also, the fixed pin prior to pulling the small roof to the belay bolt is questionable at best, back it up.  As with all other gear routes on the planet, small aliens are helpful.  The most obvious finish to me was Outer Face, definitely worthwhile.

    This is a really good route. The crux pitch is a classic shit or get off the pot scenario, but very do-able.
    Nov 12, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    On the crux P2 there are several ways to go from the fixed pins in the thin crack: 1) up the thin crack, 2) a long reach right to a good hold and then a balancy move up to a bolt, or 3) downclimbing a body-length to traverse  right then up. This last sounds convoluted but the  leader will frequently downclimb to get a rest after clipping the pins (or just placing a bombproof small cam) anyway, and this traverse is better if you don't  have a long wingspan.     In any case, I launched up on this once when I wasn't climbing too well, placed the small cam (before the  pins were placed by Chris Archer), traversed out to the 'mantle hold' and lobbed off. It's a surprisingly comfortable fall. ...so much so that I went up and  lobbed off again. I hope this little story serves to encourage people to go up on this classic pitch with  less trepidation.

    This is a great pitch. Not quite as exposed as Outer Space, less awkward and no pigeon shit. Worth doing again. The first half of the pitch is only 5.8 but fun with decent gear to be found amongst the choss. Rock gets very solid for the exit of the first overhanging bit with more decent gear just above. The most dangerous part is stepping over to place a piece in the undercling, a 5.9 friction move. Brad's beta for the big cam is spot on with the placement at waist level a few feet to the side. The crux is on amazing Bastille rock with good pro through it and after. Tried the left finish which has a couple of holds leading into it and then nothing but lichen. I ended up going right around the final overhang, better pro and easier.

    When I climbed this, it was as a finish to the Northwest Corner.  My partner had led the last pitch of the Northwest Corner and continued past the Outer Space ledge up to the ledge below the slab, and set a belay there.  It made a lot of sense to do it that way.  While the slab section is short, it was nice to be belayed when my belayer could see me, as it does get a little thin and a fall could result in hitting the ledge below the slab.

    Third pitch is basically a sport climb. Fixed pins abound! Only placed a red C3 on the traverse and a couple finger-sized pieces on some of the 5.9 sections before the juggy face. Great climbing nonetheless!

    This route deserves all the hype it gets. First time up, we brought a single rack thinking it would be casual 5.10, and I used all my finger-sized cams early on the first pitch... made the crux dihedral very exciting climbing 15 feet above a small wire. The first time I ever got on this thing I ripped what my partner said was a super old and crucial RP fixed in the middle of the first crux of the first pitch. Sorry! First moves at the beginning of the second pitch are classic Eldo: if you do it right, it is laughably easy and if you do it wrong it is insecure and weirdly strenuous. Good on you if you can remember all of the beta from memory on the second pitch every time! I invariably have to climb up and down and up and down a couple times remembering the perfect way to do the several tricky sections of that final second pitch. Substitute Wide Country for the Bastille approach pitch with a bizarre intermediate leftward hand traverse in between (R-ish) for full value!

    Wonderful route!    I didn't find it R, maybe PG-13 going around the first bulge P1 traversing to the corner, and on the P2 upper hueco-ed runout to the top, but neither sections are near the crux 5.10b-ish grade. Pro seemed plentiful and solid otherwise.    Don't let your guard down after pulling through the P2 crux. It stays pretty continuous and has a couple more interesting cruxy bits on the upper headwall.

    Spectacular position and interesting climbing.  The first pitch is insecure and sustained at 10a for a good 20-30 feet.  I think the traditional "S" rating comes from this pitch, as you have to climb 8-10 feet above a small wired nut and risk a ledgefall.  I followed both pitches, so take this in context, but to me the second pitch does seem to protect surprisingly well.

    It sounds like I was off-route on pitch one. I followed the chalk into the first corner with the ripped nut. I moved out onto the left face of the corner, using the thin finger rail, before crossing back right. It went, but it was harder than 9+, and I was a bit above my last piece by the time I was on top of the block. I'd be curious to hear what people rate it.

    CLASSIC! I have wanted to do this route since I moved to CO a couple of years ago. However, that R rating like many others has scared me away. This route definitely does not need an R rating. You can, and I did, staple the route up, hahaha! This fact does not take away from the exposure. The last pitch is amazingly exposed and awesome. I feel like the crux is short, but there is still some great moves to come to finish the route.

    This route is junk.  My partner and I did it this past weekend in near-freezing temps wearing shoes that Chinese-foot-binding specialists would have deemed torturous;  we went without water, food, or warm clothing.  To say it went easily would be an understatement, but frankly, a couple times my feet were so cold I could have sworn my name was Hugh Herr.  All the beta is total crap.  There is no exposure . . . no pumpy headwall . . . no airy traverse.  There was some rather lackluster graffiti we noticed (LK who?), which I took the time to chip off and replace with a nice (and obviously more gratifying) "Eat Me" in bright orange spray paint.  I always huff the orange stuff on routes.  It just gets me there faster . . . .

    I agree with Tony both that the top and bottom pitches are about equivalent in difficulty, and that the gear placements do not warrant an S rating.  I will say however that the gear on the P2 traverse is strenuous to place.  I was only able to get a small nut and a yellow tcu before clipping the pin and giving it a go around the corner.  Once I got around the corner, I was expecting the climb to let up a bit, but a number of 5.9 moves awaited me before I found a substantial rest stance.  Great climb!
    Jun 19, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A wonderful route as advertised.  It protects *very* well.... and most definitely does NOT warrant an R rating.  You can place gear anywhere you want it (perhaps with the exception of the last 30 feet up the huecos on P2, but the climbing is easy).    I thought P1 contained the crux, and the stemming felt about 10a/b (and a touch easier than Over The Hill).  If there was a pin at the base of the stemming (in the chimney like alcove), it is gone now.... but a red alien fit nicely.    The P2 "crux" felt about 10a as well, but the entire second pitch is definitely a journey. I placed the EXACT gear Tony B lists above, and they are all bomber.  There are plenty of rests up the final headwall, but the various moves are engaging and sometimes a bit tricky.  I had pretty bad rope drag, despite judicious use of slings, so I'm not sure how I could have avoided it.  The pitch is spectacular, but the rope drag is a big bummer.    A standard rack (nuts and two sets of cams from tiny to #3 camalot) is fine.  Lots of slings.      Edit: I just looked at a photo and saw one of someone belaying under the "end" of the traverse, and that looks like the ticket to avoiding rope drag. My belay was towards the beginning of the traverse.  YMMV
    May 20, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The pin protecting the chimney section at the beginning of the final dihedral on P1 is gone (or at least I could've sworn it was there before). You can get in a #4 BD nut and a pink tricam (neither of which felt bomber) before taking off. Fortunately, you can get gear soon after.    The high traverse on P1 is significantly harder than going low and contains the (5.10c) crux move of the whole climb IMHO.

    I climbed this today for the first time and have to agree with everyone that it is one of Eldo's best. I really don't climb S or R routes and the only reason I did was because of the comments here, so thanks everyone. I will agree the first pitch of Outer Space is the more difficult of the two. If I relate the dihedral to another classic, Over The Hill, the Outer Space dihedral is easier but still a handful and the exposure is no comparison. I am also comforted on OTH by all those pins...or is it discomforted on this one by the need to think a bit more. I'll chime a 10a.    Pitch 2 was relatively trivial, protects well, and is spectacular. I did not find a move harder than 5.9 on the pitch. With plenty of feet on the traverse and easy climbing around the corner I couldn't even tell where the crux was supposed to be. I thought it might have been a less secure leftward traverse near the end of the climb?    Overall, a fantastic climb with absolutely no R sections and plenty of rests if you want them.

    I protected the opening moves of the last pitch with a red Metolius Astro nut, a green Alien, then clipped the pin. The remaining pitch was incredible and steep with multiple 5.9+ sections. There is a small, sloping ledge about half way through the pitch that offers a chance to 'rest', though I found it difficult to rest there.  The exposure, steepness, and awesome views of the canyon took my breath away.

    Followed Shane Zentner today. Agree it's superb; agree the 1st pitch is trickier than the 2nd. But I think the 2nd still is the harder of the two and the crux was the marathon after the undercling/corner, which only felt about 10(a). The miles of 9+ pack a 10b/c pump factor, IMO. Good lead, Shane!    One other thought: On approach, it's not hard to stretch the  Bastille pitches across the traverse, past the little pillar, and belay directly under the dihedral. You can sling a couple flakes and get some small gear at the belay.

    Climbed this route in the afternoon on 9/23 for the 2nd time.  The pin is indeed missing from the start of the corner on the first pitch.  I was surprised to not find in there as I had remembered being able to clip it from the no-hands, shoulder-bar rest.  I am only 5'8" and was able to reach high and place a great wire to protect the crux move getting established in the corner.  No need to replace the pin in my opinion.

    I climbed Outer Space again on 9/15.  I hadn't seen the above comment regarding the pin, so I was surprised when it wasn't there.

    Alright, I have to admit to it and fess up.  I pulled the first piton thru the crux dihedral on the first pitch.  How one might ask?

Yes, shameful I know.  I didn't play around with it, but I think you can get a small Alien where the piton once was.  Thanks to John for hauling me up this beauty and making it look casual.

    I climbed this last night for the 3rd time and just wanted to add a more recent comment. Like everyone has said, what a great route.     p1 - Bastille Crack to ledge  p2 - Chalked-up dihedral. There are three pins you can clip in this dihedral. 2 seemed bomber to me and the other one was decent. The hard part is getting situated in the dihedral. Once in the dihedral you can stem your way up using little hands.  p3- Like everyone else has said, this is not run out at all. After pulling the 10c move, the upper part is pumpy and tricky. Counting the pin at the crux, there are three pins on this pitch as well. Only the last one looked like it belonged in the Eldo hall of fame.

    Stellar route! Followed 2 &amp; 3 today and found it to be every bit as good as advertised.   On P2 the first hard move up and over the blocky prow is made easier using the overhead rail as the crack up and over peters out. This rail is slopey in the middle, but pretty good low and higher up...there is a fixed stopper at the top of the crack. The next hard move for me was out from under a pod like stance at the start of the dihedral below the pin, using bomber underclings and the crack out on the left face to begin the business of stemming.  This move is 10b and leads to sinker fingers above and good holds up high to the ramp.    Suppose if you don't like big exposure the start of P3 might scare you, but the holds are not too bad working up &amp; over to the undercling crux move.  Mostly smearing for the feet here, there are a few small edges, and a pretty good jug around the corner to start the business on this pitch.  Pretty sustained  (9) moves, with lots of exposure, bring you to a tricky, somewhat greasy, (8+) move up and left past the last  pin.  Juggy huecos to the top ended my new favorite climb on the Bastille.

For me, the crux on P2 was getting into the undercling, once you are there,pulling around the corner was no problem.

    GEAR beta: On the headwall pitch, bring a Yellow Camalot for the start of the traverse off the belay ledge. You can reach way up and right to plug in the yellow camalot before beginning the traverse section.  Also on the headwall pitch, bring lots (10 to 12) of extra runners to minimize rope drag.    Finally, be SURE to look down at the Bastille Crack as soon as you finish the opening traverse.  It looks like a sidewalk, and makes the whole adventure fun.

    Just climbed this line again (4th time) after 3 years away from it. For the "s" pitch I placed a pretty solid #4 BD stopper just before leaving the belay (while still standing on the ledge). After 2 moves I put in a PERFECT green Alien up and right a few feet from the stopper. 2 moves later there was a yellow alien placement staring me in the face in a left hand sidepull... then the #8 stopper to the left, then up to the TCU placement beside the pin and the pin. Then around the corner to tons of gear opportunity.  In short, the climb is not S at all, unless S stands for "S"ewn-up. As for the difficulty, I too find the dihedral pitch more technical than the upper pitch and would give both 10a/b. Staying low on the upper pitch is the key, reaching the undercling by the pin from below instead of traversing over to it.
    May 8, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A fantastic route!!  Definitely three stars!  As mentioned above, I could not see how it got an S rating.  The climb, and the crux, eats up stoppers.  Even the somewhat dubious looking fixed pin at the crux (pounded straight up into a slightly flaring crack) could be backed up with a large tcu, although I'm sure that pin has held its share of falls.  As for the short bulge that can be avoided on the first pitch, I would be curious to know whether it was on the original line of ascent or not.  It offers another short section of technical 5.10- moves, is well protected and fun, but can be easily avoided by climbing down and around it.    Booty/Fixed Gear Alert!  One of the stoppers just before the crux on the second (10c) pitch, was so good that my partner was unable to clean it.  He could get the nut to move in the crack, but couldn't get it out of the rock.  He said his last attempt to free it left it pointing upwards, but believed if a leader clipped a draw on it and tugged downwards, it would seat well into its original position.  I hope that it is removable or at least becomes a good fixed piece.  If someone posts that it is neither, I will go back up on a fixed line and see if I can get it out so that it doesn't detract from this classic line.

    Great route!  I too struggled with rope drag at the top of the last pitch even though I put long runners on everything below the roof.  When I got home I looked in my old Erickson guidebook and he splits the last pitch into two, adding a belay after the roof undercling and initial steep flake (40' off ledge.)  Next time I do the route I'll try it this way.

    This route is absolutely excellent.  I recommend it to anyone interested in getting some big air out under your feet.  I agree with everyone else's comments that the first pitch of Outer Space is tougher than the the second.  That dihedral is definitely more technical and devious than the one hard move to clip the pin in the undercling on the airy final pitch.  Also, I second that motion to go around toward the right on the mini-pillar from the belay atop the first pitch of the Bastille Crack instead of trying to go up and over it.  This is one of the best I've done so far (which isn't saying much but), launch yourself into Outer Space!  The cracks and huecos toward the very top are so fun!  Take care for rope drag as you are topping out.

    Be careful not to go up the thin crack on the first Outer Space pitch to get into the dihedral.  There is/was a ripped wired nut in this crack.

    Linking these two pitches with the first three of X-M makes an excellent and airy route.  With three pitches at 10c and two at 10b, and four of them with s or vs grades, it makes for an aesthetic and rewarding line straight up the middle of the Bastille.

I also believe the first pitch (10b) to be more technical than the last pitch (rated 10c). The last pitch is long and somewhat pumpy, but probably more like 10a/b than 10c.

    This route is [unbelievable]. It is [definitely] the best route I have climbed at Eldo. [Rossiter's] book gives it and "s" rating, and this can be interpreted as "a 15 foot traverse to the left, that if [your] pro pulled during a fall, or while trying to clip the pin, would [deposit] you [...10 feet up?] onto a ledge." This one gets an "s" for the same reason Rosy Crucifixion does, a fall at the beginning might be interesting. I just wanted to clarify this [because] you never know. If you have looked at this route all spring, like I have, and not gone up and done it yet, go for it, its not too dangerous. The airy positions are killer, too.

    Three stars for sure!  Pumpy, overhanging climbing to airy arete slapping and crimping; how could this not be three stars?    Seems 90% of the loose rock has been taken off by past parties.  We too found that square hold (on the traverse to the first bolt) to be loose, so we took it home.  Thanks to all who cleaned the route.    After getting to the first bolt, I took a huge sigh of relief, and was pleased to find no more long/dangerous runouts. I was also happy to be very tall while clipping the second bolt!    All and all, great climb.

    Saturnalia is certainly a worthwhile route to finish on.  Pumpy, rough rock and a thin, balancy sequence at the end make it all the more satisfying.  But there is loose rock up there, and it isn't as good or sustained as some other climbing on other, three-star routes.  I give it two stars for quality.  Rumor has it that Charlie climbed just about everything in Eldorado Canyon. Mentioning this isn't an attempt to set a standard by which first ascents are graded.  Merely a way of keeping people honest.  Giving historical value.  When it comes to trad first ascents in Eldorado, one can't always be sure that someone hasn't come before.  At the time, when the name was proposed there was a lot of speculation about who might have first climbed the rock that became the route known as Saturnalia before Michael and Steve got their fair due.  It only adds interest that CF might have gone up there before anyone else.  Who knows?  Maybe Duncan soloed the thing.

    Regarding the first ascent. I did not know that there was new first ascent standard in Eldorado, the "rumor has it" standard. If we start with that, we will never end. Steve, I think it is best to do your fact checking correctly and explain who, what, when, and where rather than starting a cascade of dubious revisions. Now I am concerned to think that you might be writing a guidebook to this area. The "rumor has it" guidebook is bound to be an interesting one....    Saturnalia, together with Innerspace, is one of the better pitches in the Bastille. It is a great final pitch to many of the cool three pitch link-ups that the Bastille has to offer. It provides a great alternative to the often crowded and overclimbed Outerspace. I like very much the fact that it provides a bit of pumpy climbing over the roof, as well as a techincal, thin crux higher up. If finished via Lost in Space, it is just a great pitch. As for loose rock, I don't think there is any at all, but of course that is a subjective appreciation.    I think it deserves 3 stars.  rolo

    Clipping the 1st bolt can also be done solidly from a big side-pull on the left and this is better for a shorter person. Or anyone really.    Yes, traversing lower past those 1st nuts is better - I didn't use that "loose" hold for much more than balance but if someone wants to pry it off then go for it.    Yes, I did rap down to clean what I could, and did hang slings .... from RPs. Mea Culpa.     If Charlie did lead it, then he must have used some other Very Loose Holds that were balanced up there...not to mention front-pointing on the lichen I cleaned. Lichen grows very slowly so maybe it was Lewis &amp; Clark who did the FA....    This is a serious route, but not 'very serious'. It's not "for the masses" If you're not up for it then fine, but don't whine about it.

    One star, at most.  Loose, yes.  Spice, yes.  Didn't pass mustard on public nor FHRC vote first time through.  Persistence on the part of the retro-bolter did push it through the second time.

    Following Bryson on this route, I too encounter loose rock below the first bolt. Use extreme caution in this area, as it is very likey that any rock knocked off will land on the road below. And there is plenty of loose rock in this section. I broke off a foot hold yesterday, which scared the hell out of me, but did sail clear of people on XM.  Yikes!!    I think staying low and traversing out left after putting (or cleaning) gear in the crack will help you avoid the worst section of rock, though this may add to the difficulty.

    Seconding Tony on this, I damaged a hold below the first bolt (see the first picture below).  It's loose but I couldn't totally pull it off.  If you elect to run it out to the first bolt, this hold could be a nasty surprise.  If you place the nuts shown in the picture, you will be fine.  If you think you can remove the baseball-sized loose part safely, please do.  It will not drastically affect the difficulty of the climb.

    There is also a ramp system to up or down-climb between the top of P1 of WerkSupp &amp; top of P2 of Bastille Crack.  This is distinct from the above described line.

    I completely agree with Cedar about the runout on Inner Space being stout, technical, insecure, and improbable. The rock has a good bit of lichen on it which is pretty disconcerting on some of those small flakey feat. I agree that it's a substantial step up from routes like Jules Verne and Pansee Savage. This is one hell of a 3 pitch link-up!!! One of Eldo's best if you're up to the task.    Also, I'm seeing some pictures and descriptions that say to load up the big flake with gear before the runout. I thought the flake seemed to expand dangerously; however, I found a couple of bomber TCUs a few feet down and right that seemed much safer to me in the event of a monster whip.

    Wow! Inner Space is really what it comes down to. I got the onsight yesterday after fearing it for so many years. It has quite a reputation. My thoughts on it: there are two scary parts 1) from the belay to the Northwest Corner 2) from that flake to the 5.11 crux. This route is a big step up from Jules Verne. There was a lot of lichen, but it never really got in the way. If you're confident and know you WON'T fall on 5.10, then go for it. In the end, it wasn't as bad as I envisioned, but it's still a serious pitch. Where falling on some parts would land you in the hospital, or worse. Great climb!

Having led Inner Space 4 times myself, it was great to watch someone else on it from across the creek. Puts the run out into a new perspective. As you know from the point of no return till you "finally" get to the bomber stopper placement is a defining moment in yer Eldoexperience as in "thank God or whoever"! Rarely gets done...imagine that. John Baldwin always reminds me that Jeff Lowe wanted to call it the Giraffe's Neck, as in ya gotta stick your neck out!  Nice send. Peace. Steve Sangdahl  P.S.

    Well.... That was exciting.  The Spice Tour is a great way to feel born again through rock climbing.  Interceptor is on the soft side of R but really really good and perhaps the difficulty crux.  Saturnalia will feel like piss by the time you get there.  Really the crux of this worthy linkup comes down to the aptly named Inner Space pitch.  I was definitely finding my inner happy place up there.  I would call Inner Space R/X serious and a big step up from Jules Verne.  If you came off at the end of the run out... well... I can't imagine anything good would come of it.  Maybe after your 70 foot slab slapping whipper you'd be fine, but if I were a betting man, I'd put money on broken sticks.  I actually found the "10a" runout to be quite stout, technical, insecure and improbable, and the rock is a little friable, but if you are solid on 5.11 and have a cool head, it should be fine.  A good attention to detail is imperative.  If you read this in the next couple days... now is a good time to go do it, because with chalk on the route, I think it's a little less daunting.  Be prepared to clean lichen off the foot holds right at the point of no return crux about 15 or so feet into the run out! By the time you get the bomber pro before the "crux", you will not be afraid to climb 5.11 with gear at your feet!  I'm truly in awe that Jeff Lowe and John Baldwin, who I believe did the FA of Inner Space, had such big balls and technical climbing ability back in 1978.  Those guys were Heroes.  A route like this would be pretty forgettable with two bolts in the run out, but as it stands... I think you'd be hard pressed to forget this one.  Climbs like this remind me why I love climbing.  Get on it, it's awesome!

    An outstanding link-up!  Climbed this today with my bro Joe.  I got Interceptor and Saturnalia, he sent Inner Space.  Interceptor is such a classic pitch.  Just keep it together, the run-out is not too bad.  I followed Inner Space after this.  This is one fantastic journey up the Bastille.  It wasn't quite as desperate as I thought it would be.  All the really big run-outs are on moderate rock.  I think the spookiest part on lead would be getting over to the top of the Northwest Corner.  There is absolutely no pro in this section.  The crux is protected with bomber pro at your feet.  Saturnalia was a good pitch.  It sorta wanders a bit.  Totally out of character with the previous two pitches.  All in all, The Spice Tour is great climb.

    Wow!  Got on this wild route recently and we completed the first 2 pitches (ran out of time to do the 3rd).  Although I got scared and backed off the 1st pitch, it wasn't too bad in retrospect, with pro at your feet during the crux moves (the green Alien), then much easier moves to the flake pro mentioned above.  The next pitch (Inner Space) was much scarier, real glad I wasn't leading that!  The crux felt very technical, even for Eldo, and I would rate it 11c.... at least the pro there was reasonable, pretty good gear at your feet as you start the hard moves.  The dihedral above that was very funky and awkward and felt like solid 5.10, but the pro here was decent.  The quality is absolutely excellent throughout, funny how some of the best routes in Eldo are the spiciest!

    Thanks, Gregger for the chains, much appreciated. Just a short PSA in regard to rappelling Werk Supp: if rapping the route with a 70m rope or double ropes from the top of pitch 1 (i.e. in one rap), please be sure to rap directly over the top of the March of Dimes buttress. You will rap directly over the chains on top of pitch 1 of MoD. Do NOT descend via the gully between MoD and Werk Supp. That gully is stacked with large, loose boulders. When dislodged, those boulders will find their way to the base of Werk Supp (where there is often a belayer) and/or into the road. We were unfortunate enough to be at the base when a climber chose the loose gully and kicked loose a microwave size block, which triggered several other large rocks to tumble down to the road. No one was hurt, but it was a good reminder: 1) to always wear a helmet everywhere in eldo 2) that even 2 minutes from the car, there are loose rocks on routes/raps that see enormous traffic.  Please stay out of that gully!    Kyle

    I did just the first pitch today as a last climb before heading home.  I loved the climbing!  I wish I had brought more small gear (BD #0-0.2) as the finger crack at the top of the climb was more challenging with just placing nuts.  I used up my smaller gear lower on the climb.  Although a #4 is not necessary, I did place one toward the bottom of the climb.    I rapped from the bolts using a 70 meter rope and got to the ground with very little to spare.

    The first time I did this route was in 1979, back then I could not afford cams. Didn't trust them either, they were new and looked unreliable. Hey, I was climbing trad, my shoes were PAs if anybody remembers them.    P1 was wonderful, sustianed but not too difficult. P2 was a bit more commited. I was able to get a #8 hex in at the "slot". I did not trust it but continued on anyway. Ten feet above it I peeled! Falling head over heels backwards, chalk raining down like snow. My belayer held me two feet above the belay ledge!   The #8 hex held!! I could not believe it! So I smoked a ciggarette to calm the nerves and made it on my second try. I love that climb!

    Thanks, David.  That's all I needed to go fire it up this morning.    I led both pitches.  I was able to get some "okay" gear in before the pin.   The pin is not really needed, but I clipped it anyway.   Super fun and intricate moves in the finger crack.       I ended up peeling off on P2 after pulling out of the funky pod half way up the pitch.  Then finished it off clean.  I would recommend 2 #1 Camalots for the P2 hand crack.   Also bring a #2, a #3 and leave the #4 at home (or use it for the P2 belay).    What a classic route!  Get on it if you have not yet :)    Drew

    Drew, in my experience (have led pitch 1 3 times that I can think of), I've found the climbing up to the finger crack to be much easier than the rest of the route, maybe 5.7, climbing is on big holds.  Much of the initial section is expando rock and some people might not bother to place gear but there are some decent possibilities.  I seem to remember a good pin or 2 that also inspired some confidence.  The pro at the crux is bomber and I don't feel the R rating is warranted.  Just my 2 cents though.

    Beta question for P1.      Whenever I see people leading this, their first piece appears to be about 20-25 feet above the ground.   Why?  Is there no gear before then?   Is the rock just not worth placing gear in?  If so, then what would you rate the difficulty of the first section of the climb before the finger crack.  Despite the fact there is no "R" rating on this climb, I am leary to lead it because I am not a fan of routes that have no pro near the ground.  Although that is a common characteristic for Eldo routes :-).    Any thoughts would be welcome.    Regards,    Drew

    I followed pitch one and I thought it was quite interesting and somewhat typical Eldo style with traversing and steep face with the occasional crack feature for gear and what not.  Pretty sporty; sustained and a bit bold, I don't think I would have enjoyed to lead it.      P2. Was mine and I was a bit nervous with anticipation of the awkward looking crack but also eager to get on it and learn something.  I got up and placed 2 cams and got pretty pumped trying to see how to get up the akward section onto the stance in the first pod, I came off and grabbed a cam to keep from decking as my belayer was back at the chains of pitch 1 and there would have been a bit of rope stretch.      I lowered to the ground and started again after looking it over a bit.  I got into the first rest stance in the pod and got some more gear, and kept working the hands/ wide hands crack through the pods getting gear and an awkward rest occasionally.  I plugged a #1 near what seemed the crux and ran it out to the ledge with the tree on the far side.    Both I and my partner found this to be stout for the grade and definitely sustained for the short pitch it was.  The thing seems to want to spit you out the whole time, and there isn't much out side of the crack to keep you in so you just have to work the jambs, keep moving and keep an eye out for holds on either side of the crack when the going gets rough.     We took MOD for the third pitch and both had some trouble with it seems stout to me, bout as hard as Northcutt Start on BC for sure IMO. We continued up the OW directly above and over to the last pitch of BC, good fun! Pretty sure I used my 3.5 and #4 on p2. and my partner wanted the #4 on the OW above the finger crack on MOD.

    Larry, I think the ramp from the top of P1 on Werk Supp to the P2/P3 pitch of the Bastille Crack goes at 5.8ish if you stay to the left its 5.6ish with crappy pro if you go to the right its 5.8ish with better pro and an old pin at the crux; I think the route is called "Shatek's Ramp-age."

    Since a rappel on a 60m rope will get you down within 10 feet of the ground with stretch, it's obviously not at 140-150 ft. pitch. I'd put it closer to 105 ft. Vertical distances are usually overestimated.

    Larry,     I've done this a few times and it links up fine.  There is one tricky and awkward 5.8ish spot with poor pro (an old pin, I think) and quite a bit of loose rock but it goes...      The second pitch of WS gears up very well and is short.  Go for it... when you're ready...

    Sure.  From the top of WS pitch one (the lovely finger crack), cruise easily up the ramp to the right and enter a short but awkward dihedral (5.6; may be a fixed pin here).  You will arrive at the belay on top of BC pitch 3.

    Climbed P1 today -- I thought the 5.8+ rating was right on.  Beautiful sustained climbing with plenty of gear placement opportunities.  We took 2 full sets of aliens and I used everyone along with 13 runners and various other pieces.  Big gear is good to use in the first 30 feet but not a requirement.  Also, a 60m rope for rappel gets you to about 10 feet off the ground to an easy down climb.  I placed a perfect red Alien right in the crux but also found that I needed that hand hold.  Next time I would use a stopper or something.  Great route!

    Goodness...Concerning the gear on this route, I recommended WAY too much. Doubling cams from green Aliens-2" is insane considering the weight you're carrying. Remember that I set enough gear for AID. This is when double ropes are recommended, NOT for a free ascent. This is not an Indian Creek varying crack, so don't gear up for that. Just bring a standard Eldo rack (but include some small cams and hexes. They will help). Thanks Leo. ~Wm

    Trail another rope or use it for double rope gear (better idea) and you can rap to the ground from the chains ten feet east of the ledge you end up on after pitch one.     Was going to aid this today but we had a nice break in the cold snap and it went On Sight free on lead. I placed enough gear for aid (double ropes) should my girlfriend need it, but she toughed it out. REALLY classic first pitch. I'd do this three or four times a year for a quick run up a fun yet challenging route, especially if the Bast. Crack  is a traffic jam. Easy climbing lets you top off the beast after pitch one anyway...     For gear, double up on nuts #7-9, double green Aliens-2" cams. For an anchor on a direct line with the first pitch, bring a pink tri-cam #9 BD stopper, and appropriate cams. You can set up an equalized anchor in the wide finger slot just after the cruxy overhang with accompanying finger-tip crack. If you're bailing after this, belay down to the chains and rap directly to the base. OR simul the rest of the broken ramp to top out the rock quickly.    Can't wait for the warm weather!~Wm

    I led this route and finished with March of Dimes yesterday. All 3 pitches are stellar, in my opinion.    P1: sustained 8+, very enjoyable, a little runout after the first piece. Bring plenty of small-medium cams (i.e. 0.2-0.75 Camalot equivs.) and larger nuts. Definitely belay from below P2, rather than at the bolt anchor.    P2: I loved this pitch and felt more secure on it than on P1. I don't know what the + is doing in the rating. Maybe it is hand-size dependent, but I didn't find this particularly hard, and it is short. There are good feet on the right face and in the crack and the hand jams are bomber. I would say 5.9, no plus. It is easy to continue onto March of Dimes without stopping for a belay, although this may have been my downfall (I fell on the 10c crux) as I was kind of pumped after the first two pitches. May have benifitted from a rest before tackling MoD. Gear: I placed Camalots 4, 0.5, 3, 2, 1 BUT I think a 4 is unnecessary and a 3 would have been better in that placement.    P3: (March of Dimes) Hard, for me anyway. Tricky feet and crimpy hands up high. Used small nuts and Yellow and Green aliens (equiv. to BD 0.3, 0.2 I think), the latter of which held multiple lead falls before I figured out the sequence. My partner, Mike Flanagan flashed it though. The belay atop is weird. Sling a root, good BD #2, poor BD#3 (would have been better with bigger cam).

    I didn't place anything bigger than a #3 Camalot near the crux(the offwidth is too flared for anything bigger.) Solid at the grade and burly.  Laybacking caused me to barndoor and fall several times. Maybe a combination of jamming and laybacking would work.  Well worth the effort and fun to do.

    Before I led P2 I was given some beta on gear, which included taking a couple of Metolius #3s and a #4.  The only gear I used, and felt very secure, were #1s and #2s.  It is not actually an off-width, but a solid, be it awkward, hand crack.  Because of the right leaning and downward direction of the crack, it leaves your body hanging and your right foot smearing most of the way.

    .... there are many flakes to hang a rope on, not to mention the rocks perched on top of P1 March of Dimes.  I'm sure it is possible to rap directly from the anchors atop P1 Werk Supp, but doing it in 2 shorter raps significantly reduces the chance of something going wrong.

    I agree with everyone, the first pitch is a really great climb.  The pitch is varied, interesting and fairly sustained.  The protection at the bottom of the route looked a little bit sketchy, although I didn't lead the route.  But I thought the harder, upper moves were well protected.  I really look forwared to leading this pitch.    I think the first pitch is rated 8+ in Rossiter's guide, and I would say that's right on.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Linking this route with the last pitch of March of Dimes is great, and it makes the descent much easier.  Even though pitch two was short, I found myself placing more gear than I usually would only because the ramp on which the belayer sits angles up right quite steeply.  Resultingly, in the the event of a fall, hitting this ledge is quite likely if the leader has run it out at all.  9+ is a good grade for this pitch, but the 10c March of Dimes pitch is a bit overgraded (more like a/b) especially when compared with routes like Bolting for Glory (10a) and Northcutt Start (10d).

    Somehow I never realized that there were bolts on top of the first pitch.  Always did the long runner and belay at base of P2, as someone mentioned.  This is a great route, though personally I don't like the first pitch very well (the 2nd one makes up for it though).

    I did both pitches yesterday and I would have to say... the second pitch is VERY STRENUOUS, especially after doing such a long pitch before it.  Absolutely a 9+, if you are not comfortable climbing 9's then don't try it unless you got doubles in the #1 and 2 Camalots.  I also found this climb to be VERY odd from the usual Eldo climbing style.  I can't wait till I have more time to try the next section of March of Dimes (10c)... what a cool lookin' crack.
    Jun 11, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Yes, I made the same mistake on the descent too which made for some tangy downclimbing the steep slope with loose rocks. The correct or easier way is to stay high on the traverse until you see the talus field.     I found that many smaller pieces work best for the first pitch. My largest piece was a #2 Friend until the last move, where I placed a #3 Friend.     On a side note, Myke and I were filmed on this route today (4-30-01) for some climbing instruction program to be aired on a new cable network. We will probably get 5 sec. at the end when they are fading out. ;-)

    The crux is insecure but safe on a big shiny bolt, although clipping that bolt is a little spooky and reachy from a just barely secure stance. The runouts are indeed on easier terrain and probably warrant an R rating (clean but looong), but if you pulled the crux, then there's no way you're going to botch those moves.  Agree with Scott that it's a great summertime Eldo pitch early in the morning.

    After the crux at the bolt, you can place a finger-sized piece or nut in a crack near the Bastille Crack attached with a double-length runner.      Save a 0.75, red Alien, and yellow Alien for the top.

    I really enjoy this climb, it's a great quick single pitch to do in the summer. I don't feel that it's particularly dangerous, all the runouts are on much easier ground and the crux is very safe (though hard!).   I found that double ropes really helped to maximize the pro on this pitch.

    Sick Onsight, if you are reading this page to gather beta before you climb it you are missing out on a great gut check.  Stop reading now while you still can!

    I did the first pitch again today.  Even more classic than I remember.  One thing concerned me, though.  There is a block that you have to pull on at the end of some run-out climbing just before the crux.  It is actually what you're standing on just before launching into the crux.  This block sounded very loose when I tapped on it.  Perhaps it has always been this way, and I've just never noticed before.  Does anyone know whether it has always been loose, or has it only become so recently?  The above comment about the rock being absolutely bomber makes me wonder.  Anywhay, be careful, but don't be deterred.  Just try not to pull out on it.

    This was one of the harder 11a climbs I've attempted in Eldo. The slightly awkward and fairly scary though short crux seems a bit harder than 11a to me - also, if you blow it you'll swing down and right, into the small broken dihedral that you traversed from (could hurt quite a bit). Granted, I hate to fall, so a mental edge is needed here, and for the RO that follows the crux. The RO sections of 5.9 climbing that precede the crux aren't too bad, and the climbing is really nice; though a fall shouldn't be considered a choice. I'd certainly give this climb a balzy rating. BTW, the rock is absolutely bomber.

    I agree with the comment by Anonymous Coward that: "the traverse to the left off  the  XM belay is the crux of the climb" rarely is this interesting  little piece of climbing attempted. In all my years around Eldo I've never seen anyone even try it.  It's a mystifying no-hands high step onto a nubbin. I've lead this section a few times and must say that when one puts it into  the context  of Duncan Ferguson and Don Peterson in EBs on-sighting it ... it's really quite impressive. Try it and see for yourself. It's a bit of a run-out and may give you a dry throat! Kevin Worrall and I did a nice finish to this climb as well. The climbing extends the original line and maintains the standard and personality of the route. Description of the pitch is in Steve Levin's Eldorado climbing guidebook.

    The tat around the chockstone at the bottom of the Dalke offwidth will hold a fall. A few months ago, I led the offwidth after clipping the chockstone tat with a sling. After feeling a bit insecure due to grease and funky beta, I started to downclimb from 25-30 feet above the chockstone. I was unable to downclimb the entire way and ended up taking a 40-footer onto the tat and ending up eerily close to the ground. I then grabbed a #6 Camalot and reclimbed the pitch clean. Someone might want to tie some new cord there sometime soon, but it is good enough for now.

    Wow, I'm surprised to see almost no mention of the offwidth variation (original free variation?) to the first pitch. The way most of you guys are going sounds a bit hairball. Got up there the other day and it was great! Pretty secure and featured, while still physical. The chockstone seems like it's not going anywhere, and if you want to you could potentially bring a big cam to push through the crux. Doesn't seem to get a ton of traffic, but I'd recommend it for a bit of old school fun.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Mike C. is totally spot on. The second pitch is very serious for the leader - with bad fall potential (suspect RPs with a bad landing if they blow). A ballsy lead. If the second blows the crux, no big deal - a top roped swing to the left with nothing to hit - I've had two seconds take this fall - they were able to swing back into the start and try again. The suggestion to solo or backclean the pitch doesn't make any sense (i.e. is crazy) to me.    Wally
    Sep 2, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Linked the first two pitches, which made sense to me at the time, because if the micro nut blows at the crux, you'd fall down instead of swinging onto the bolted anchor and the pillar. Of course, you're likely to fall further, but I didn't test the theory. The swing is not a big deal for the follower if you place a nut loosely after the traverse. Everything will pull out when you move up and you can claim that you soloed the second pitch. :)
    Aug 7, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Let's not kid ourselves. In the description, it is written that this climb is a more serious for the second when in fact I have seen many climbers fall from the crux and just swing left 15 feet or so. Yes, I assume it is a little scary to fall from there as a seconding climber. If the leader were to fall and his little manky stopper actaully hold, they'd hit the edge of the big old flake/chimney and it could be nasty, and if for some reason that piece failed they might never walk again.... So, I don't agree that it is more dangerous for the second. I do think that if you do X-M to Outerspace in 3 pitches, it's one of the best 5.10s in the canyon, if not the best.

    After contemplating the crux move on p2 for a good twenty minutes I ended up committing to the higher variation with two tiny sidepulls.  Either way, it's one move that is quite exciting.  The RPs there are mental gear.
    Oct 14, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Link P1 and P2.  You can use a cordalette to clip the anchors above the pillar just like it was a long draw.  This allows the leader to fall straight down on the nuts if they slime off, and if they do fail you won't take the full ride b/c you will hit the bolts.  when I lead it I didn't have anything long enough to pull off this trick.  So I had my belayer up on the pillar.  That situation would have pulled the nuts around the corner hard to the right if I lost it.  Not confidence inspiring. In fact I wouldn't put a rice cake on them if they pulled into that orientation.  Have fun.

    This is a "heady" route!! Awesome rock and cool moves.  My partner led p1&amp;2 together which seemed pretty bold.  I was pretty worried about the big swing following the moves off the pillar.  For p3 I tried to go up the left var. but backed off, gear wasn't great, and I couldn't find anything that would keep me off the ledge.  so, I went up the right side. All was well, I got to the base of the O.S. dihedral and kept moving right.  I clipped a pin (shoulda clipped two) and started the looong upward traverse right.  I got a ways past tht old janky slightly downward driven pin (about 10-12ft out) and lost a foot on some lichen.  This sent me for a freaking long ass ride!!! We guestimated about 30-35ft!! By far the longest fall I've taken! If that pin pulled it would've added another 30ft to that (my last piece was a good 15ft below).  I finished the pitch but still found no other gear 'til the dihedral.  A lot of lichen and not much chalk tells me most people don't do this pitch. It's a scary pitch I think but well worth doing, and it is part of the original climb.  Outer Face is aloso a good exit option if you don't want to do O.S. again or if someone is on it.

    WRONG FLAKE!  In my previous posting, I said that the flake I blew was the same that Ivan mentioned above.  The flake that blew was NOT the hand-traverse flake, but a much smaller undercling flake about 10 feet directly above the belay.

    FLAKE ON P3 HAS MOVED!  Today (6/20/04), I fell on the right-hand/straight-up variation on P3, pulling two cams and the flake under which I had placed them.  This is the flake that Ivan Rezucha mentioned on 5/16/04 as being loose.  I'm not sure how this has affected the rating on this pitch, as we bailed and did not finish the pitch.  The flake is now sitting (marked "XXX" with chalk) fairly securely on the ledge just up and left of the belay ledge Fortunately, my partner and I only suffered minor abrasions and a good scare, and the flake landed in his lap.  I'd hate to think what would have happened if the flake had fallen to the base...

    Here's another testimonial for the quality of the small RP on the 10c variation to the 3rd pitch, and the insecurity of the move.  No need to risk a 25 footer... my foot slipped off the mantle and the RP held... basically a 5 foot fall.  The move isn't that hard, but you mantle with your weight fully on a polished, slanting hold... a strange, insecure move.  Look around for the placement... it isn't immediately obvious, but it's there.

    I really wanted to do the original 4th pitch rather than finishing on Outer Space, although Outer Space sure looked tempting.    We had neglected to read the guidebook, but I knew it went up a dihedral right of Outer Space. I thought it was the dihedral just right of the Outer Space dihedral, but my 1980 Erickson and Ament guides now make it pretty clear that it's the green dihedral much further right.    And that is what we climbed. From the belay above P3, climb up about 20' to where Outer Space traverses in from the left. Move right on the red band to below a small dihedral with 3 pins. I thought I was going to climb this up to the dihedral just right of Outer Space, but it looked way hard. Continue right to a tenuous stance. I had a real hard time here letting go with either hand, but eventually got gear. Make one more hard move up and right to better holds and easier climbing. Continue right to the base of a left facing dihedral with a good crack (finally!). Thinking I was home free, I was surprised to find a hard move half way up the dihedral. The crack runs out, and I had to step left onto a sloped hold on the arete with not much for the hands. One more hard move back right into the corner, and easier climbing to the top.    Erickson says this of the pitch: "Move up a little and angle 30' right, then climb a dihedral . 5.9". Felt harder, 10a S? Ament says, "...with marginal protection traverse right (5.9) across a steep band of rock. Ascend a left-facing dihedral 5.8 [felt much harder to me] near the west edge of the wall. Rossiter's topo looks correct but his text makes the rightward traverse sound short.    Questions: What's the dihedral just right of the Outer Space dihedral? Below that dihedral, what's the dihedral with the 3 pins a short ways right on the XM traverse? Just right and up from those 3 pins is a left facing flake with a pin. What's that? There are lots of routes and variations on this wall. It's hard to figure it all out.

    Unsure of whose advice to heed regarding linking P1 and P2, I used double ropes with one rope clipped with a long sling to the bolts above the pillar, and the other rope going straight up to the brass nuts. This worked pretty well, but I had a lot of drag trying to rock over onto my left foot after the crux. That was pretty tenuous. With double ropes you can just run the right rope straight up from the P2 crux to the bolt right of the belay that  Steve Dieckhoff mentions above. Looks like a big Crack'n Up will go in above the higher brass nut. Next time...    I actually had more trouble on P1. The first 25' or so are really slick and no gear for a while (but I placed a piece high on Wide Country, and then pulled the rope through after getting gear on route). The moves leading to the step across are awkward. At the step across it's reallly pumpy. I hesitated at the step across, put in a cam above the last pin. Downclimbed about 10'. Tried to rest, went back up, then had to hang.    On P3, the 9 way makes the most sense to me and is the original aid route. It's straight up above the belay, and the gear is good until the hand traverse. But beware!  I followed this pitch, and a small Alien was really stuck. Chuck said, "Maybe the flake expanded when I leaned out on it." Sure enough, I used my nut tool as a mini crowbar, and I could visibly expand the flake (not the smartest thing to do, as I was hanging on another cam in the same flake while working on the stuck cam).    After cleaning the gear, I downclimbed the 9 variation and TR'd the 10 variation on the left. Didn't see that trick wire. Had to pop for the ledge. May not be leading that variation any time soon.

    if you are tall, like me, the crux could be the move out of the handcrack on P1.

The crux on P3 is a reach problem, but not pumpy, like on P1.Don't make the mistake, like we did, of thinking that you can downclimb the ramp to the left from the top of P3.

    I just led the 2nd pitch this morning and I didn't place any RP's at the start of the route. With the belayer positioned correctly, this feels quite safe. Don't fall after the crux move, of course, but then it is easy. Place the stopper underneath the small flake - tricky to find and place because it isn't obvious, but it's there.    I led the third pitch as well and after clipping the three fixed pins, you can place what appears to be a very solid #2 steel RP (might be a #1 - anywhere a really small nut). This placement is not immediately obvious as there are to other placements that are larger, but not very secure and I doubt would hold a fall. This tiny RP doesn't inspire much confidence, but if it held, this pitch would be well protected. If you fell and it pulled, that would be bad, as the pins are well below your feet the crux move.    Great climb!    Bill

    If you're gripped about the nut on top of the flake, string additional runners over to the two-bolt anchor to back it up -- the nut would keep you from swinging inside the flake if the micronuts were to fail.     I think it's better to lead this way because if you were to fall on the micronuts, the catch would be very dynamic and they are more likely to hold. If you belay, you're looking at an awkward pull on the nuts as Joe desribes or placing nothing -- either way, a nasty fall for both the leader and belayer.

    Joe,    I guess it is the wimpy way, but the way you describe leading it (linking the pitches without using the belay anchor), the risk is way too high for someone like myself. I have also heard of people linking the pitches, but clipping the chains with many long slings. Seems like too much hassle to me and your method (of just using the RP's with the next piece way below that) is just too dangerous for me. Hats off to the guys like yourself who have the mental control for such feats!    I should probably also say that I haven't even led the pitch in question! I have belayed two people using this method, though. I need to go lead it. I followed it fine the last time up there.    Bill

    Hey Bill-  isn't that the wussy way of doing it?... just kidding.  That actually seems like really good beta for those who want to do the route but might not be the most solid at the grade.  I have heard of people linking the first 2 pitches, but clipping the chains for crux pro... big, big swing potential.    FYI- I think linking the 1st and 2nd pitches is actually much safer than belaying at the chains on top of the pinnacle.  A belay from the chains would likely put an outward force on the delicately placed RPs at the crux, possibly pulling them out.  With the rope running straight down the RPs are more likely to stay put... as it is, the highest RP pulled on me anyway as I did the easy traverse part. That next piece of gear sure is a long way below the RPs though.

    I just noticed that this route has only one star. Bogus! Two stars at least when you combine it with Outer Space.    As stated above, if you combine the first two pitches, it appears to be quite dangerous for the leader. Also, as stated above this route is NOT dangerous for the second even if the leader fails to place the stopper above the crux as indicated above.    Here's the new information. If not combining the second pitch with the first there is a good way to protect the leader. The belayer clips into the bolts at the top of the pillar with a long length of rope and climbs back down to just above and right of the crux moves. Braced in the slot by the pillar and the wall, the belay can now give the leader nearly a toprope for the crux moves! In fact, I wouldn't even bother placing the RP's - the belayer is above you. If you step out low (tricky and balancy), then there is a single hard move to do.

    X-M__Outer Space is one of the best 5.10 routes I've done in Colorado, along with the Scenic Cruise, Yellow Wall/Forrest Finish, and the Book link-ups at Lumpy.  As stated above you can get two RP placements right at the crux, but it takes some work to find the optimal placements.  The nuts are decent, that is they'll probably protect the crux but I certainly wouldn't want to take a big winger (or an 8 footer for that matter) on them. Be solid!! If the leader fires the crux then he/she should have no trouble finsihing the pitch without placing any more gear. The leader can then clip the Inner Space bolt to protect the 2nd as stated above.

    If the first two pitches are lead together, then it is definately scarier and more dangerous to be on lead during the crux.  I followed the pitch, thank god, and pulled the crux moves before cleaning the disturbing RP.  I'm fairly confident that had I fallen during the crux, the rp would have kept me from the big swing.  However, the above advice for the leader to reach back right, following the traverse, and placing something for the second is good.  It's impressive to link pitches 1 and 2 together, climbing directly into the crux from the chimney.

    I must say that this route deserves atleast two stars.  Good rock, good moves, good line.  Plus if you combine it with Outer Space, it's one of the most fun/best 5.10's in the canyon if not the front range.

    On P2 the leader can back-clean even to the point of  clipping the anchor and downclimbing the easy  dihedral....after that it's fairly easy to climb out right from  the belay and clip into the bolt on INNER SPACE (the  only real use for that bolt)--this will give the second a  good toprope. They take a little swing but it's not as bad  as they think it'll be.      On P3-the left-hand var.--I usually place a very small  but solid RP next to the crux 'long reach' move. It goes  into a perfect little slot formed on one side by a crystal.  After the long reach it's nice to get a good piece in and I  think the best might be a tri-cam!

    If you don't have HB's there is a really solid #3 Black Diamond Micro Stopper (steel-head) in the seam at the crux.  Reach up high and slide it down until it catches.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    As Charles states above, it is quite possible to place good gear for the second on the 2nd pitch. After completing the crux, climb up and set left a few feet to a good stance. From here it isn't hard to reach back to the right and place good gear directly above the crux. The second is completely safe now. I did indeed fall off while following the crux. I went only a couple feet to the left and was able to get back on and do the crux the second time. My advice on the crux - step onto the wall as low as possible. Once that is done, heading up involves only a single hard move.
    Sep 13, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    for pitch 2, the climbing becomes easy after the crux, and so if the stronger climber is leading, it would be advised to run it to the belay or as far as he/she finds comfortable.  this will make the swing of the second less substantial (more like a toprope than traverse) and will make it easy to get back on the route after the fall.  even better, climb the route with two solid 5.10 leaders, no falls, no worries.
    Aug 1, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There are 2 possible brass-nut placements just around the corner from the flake-belay. I used 2 HB micronuts (not offsets) These can be placed from a good (not pumpy) stance at the corner if you can do a near-splits (or are very tall, which I am not) or from a slightly off-balance stance once arount the corner on the face holds.    A few more things- yes, the old KB's on Pitch 3 will hold a 30' fall. That was me on Sunday. It might be a little harder in the heat/sun. Do it before the sun hits in if on a summer afternoon.    The route should get 2*'s. Great route, but not the best.
    Aug 1, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I did not see any nut placements out right post-crux.  I have led and followed the second pitch and found it scarier to follow.  If the second is really worried, it's not that hard to tie off short, use the extra rope to thread the anchor atop pitch one and give yourself a back belay (probably easier with a grigri).  It's the same idea as lowering yourself out from an anchor on an aid route.  Tom Isaacson

    Have not done this route, but I distinctly remember a Bill Wright TR where he describes falling on the P2 crux as the second climber, and not swinging at all.  His partner, he said, was able to creatively place a stopper back right after the crux.  Unfortunately this TR was only on my e-mail inbox and somehow got deleted...it isn't on Bill's website.  Anybody familiar with this?

    I climbed the .10 variation last night. I think it has better and more interesting climbing. It's more technical, but if you stick the correct sequence, it's less work than the 10a crux. Those well versed in the "Eldo dance" will probably execute it easily. I still, however, think, that it is probably a 5.10 pitch and not 5.9, but I don't have much grade sensitivity in this area.

    Blind Faith.          I have loved this climb since I first climbed it in the '80s with hexes and stoppers!

    Being that I've lead this climb as a single pitch on most occasions, with a 60m or a 70m rope, (the 70m leaves you more room at the end for anchors), I can assure you that this climb in just under 200' in total.  It would be nice to change the main description that says 250' to accurately reflect this possibility/opportunity. (EDIT: Done)

    A great, well protected route.  You can throw as much gear as you want on the first pitch, but I recommend saving some #1-#3 Camalots for the top bit.

    We did the route yesterday and it ruled.  The 10c variation went without hitches. Crux Beta: step high enough to gain a jug with the left hand  and jam your fingers in the 10c crack. Reach higher with the left or just cross through to a nice two-hand shelf.  There's a good nut placement above the 10c jam.   My partner noticed a loose hand-hold near the start of pitch 2 in the chossy looking rock.

    This was my first onsight 10 in Eldo, not bad IMO I got a Brown Point on Northcutt Start yesterday as I rested on the pin at the crux, but that was the first ten ever in Eldo, so not bad.  As a solid crack climber I found this one to be pretty easy. I thought some of the jambs were shaky at first with my skinny hands, but upon readjusting, the jams held quite well.  Ran it out a bit to the crux (not necessary, but I didn't have many long runners), then threw a #2 in at the start of the crux, and thought I would run it out to the lip jams were so good I hung in there and put in another #2 and a #1 then turned the lip on a good jam high with the left and I think the right hand crimp with feet high in the crack. Then stepped onto a nice little edge on the arete and it was done.  The anchor really sucked, and I was a little scared for my life.  Went left from the belay to a 5.6 exit with nice cracks, because I didn't want my "green" partner to try to lead his first 5.9 trad route on chossy rock above a manky anchor. One pitch next time with a lot more long runners, and I will take the right variation and the original 2nd pitch.

    Most people probably assume Jim Erickson simply walked up to this climb and free soloed it.  In fact, Jim is a shrewd and calculating fellow and climbed up and down the start numerous times over many days before he committed to the crux section.  In the 70s in Eldo, most climbers were experts at climbing down as well as up difficult sections.  These days it is all too tempting to yell "TAKE!"    This route was climbed last weekend by Jim Logan and Wayne Goss, together with one of their sons!  I was hanging out at the base chatting with them, which is where I got the info on the first ascent.

    I think this would be a great first 5.10 lead in Eldo...especially if you know how to hand/foot jamb.  The pro is excellent...except for going over the bulge maybe, but you can put a super solid #3 or #2 Camalot in right before the move.  I've never crimped or mantled up over the crux, but just keep jamming until I'm over.  I found the 5.9 move on P2 harder than the P1 hand crack actually.  No bolts needed IMHO...you can build a great anchor at the top of P1, and it's a two pitch route.

    "For this reason, I think there should be one bolt placed a few feet left of the pin."    The bolt you suggest would violate the entire premise of the climb and the park as well as the rules of the legally chartered FHRC.   With time, you will get used to Eldo and what is good and what is not and will probably feel more secure about climbing in Eldo.  My comment on Jan 30, 2002 (read above) may have once spurned a sentiment somewhat like your own at this time, but as it says, I don't climb like I once did, but I feel safe there now.
    Jun 4, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A fixed anchor is not going to happen given that you could climb up a few more feet and get multiple good pieces above the alleged loose block. The climb can also easily be done in one long pitch, but then you might be asking for a bolt at the top where an anchor is hard to arrange if you've used all your big pieces.
    Jun 4, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I am relatively new to Eldo (30 routes or so).  I think the anchor at the top of pitch one is uninspiring.  The anchor spot consists of a large block wedged into the crack.  It is possible, though unlikely, that it could move and spit out your gear.  I did not have one piece I trusted 100%, much less three, so I put in 7 pieces in five different cracks around all the loose junk.  Yes, it was overkill, but an anchor is supposed to be overkill.  Especially in this case where the first 25 feet of the next pitch has no great gear.  I guess you could sling one of the massive blocks lodged in the crack, but I didn't want to touch it, much less be attached to it.  Before you get the first good piece (a crack formed by two large walls rather than a crack on either side of a loose looking block) I pulled hard on a torso-sized block that had no visual means of attachment.  I can't believe it hasn't fallen out yet.  For this reason, I think there should be one bolt placed a few feet left of the pin. This would make the anchor bomber.  At this point, it might be good. I will not belay at this spot again if I can avoid it. Doing it in one pitch is a good idea if your experienced enough to alleviate the ropedrag and can run it out enough to conserve gear for the whole pitch.        BTW.  I don't think a fixed anchor is necessary for the first pitch, but one good piece would be nice for the possibility of a forty foot factor-two fall from pitch two.
    Jun 4, 2007

    It was too difficult to sort through the comments above, so I thought I would quickly recommend the 10c variation over the 10a variation.    The climbing on the 10a side is a bit of a grovel (though well protected).    The climbing on the 10c side has much more aesthetic movement and gear that is just as good.  Yellow and green Alien and or nuts can sew this up.  Give it a shot!
    May 14, 2007

    A pretty solid and classic 10a. Definitely would be good to follow to figure out the mantle/bulge sequence at the top before leading. Quite awkard mantle on some loose stuff with not-so-bomber jams. A really fun route though, I high recommend it. Watch out for some loose flakes near the second bulge, would be a bad place to put in protection to protect the crux.

    Holly **** Stephanie!  Maybe I was a bit tired from doing (leading) both Hair City and West Buttress, but having done quite a number of low 10s in Eldo, P1 crux completely shut me down, and I had to aid it (and yes, I can climb crack, no I'm not a 5.12, or even 11+ sport climber).  P2 is straightforward 9, even pumped.  I think there is a 'bad' way or trying to do the P2 crux, though my partner inexplicably fell multiple times seconding.    Discussions on route difficulty never cease to amaze me.  When I did West Buttress a couple of years ago, the 9+ crux seemed hard - I had to deadpoint for it - and definitely felt sandbag 9+.  This time it felt quite straightforward (footwork being key), as did the 10a straight up (although did feel 10a).  People talking about Xanadu being 'hard' for 10a, Uhhh?  It's just stemming with good gear.  Technique and how you feel on the day seem to make a big difference in Eldo.    Then, others are like "Blind Faith is a good first 10", and I fell multiple times - something I haven't done in Eldo before.  The pro is decent, but strenuous to place, and I was looking at a 10+ footer trying to top out without placing the last cam up there (I got pumped placing that last piece).    A really good, fun climb though, and I wouldn't hesitate to get back on it, even if I did not expect to make the crux.  The bulges before hand and P2 are just a delight.      Then again, who knows, maybe I'll find it "easy" 10a next time!
    Aug 9, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    We took the left-side (10a) variation on pitch 1, and I thought it was maybe 5.9+. If you have good crack technique, there is actually a good hand jam (for your left hand) right over the edge where you have to mantel and a handhold off to your right. I happened to think the second pitch move over the roof right off the belay was more 10a than the first pitch crux - I'm only 5'5" and I had to really lay it back and reach to get a semi-good hand jam in the crack before I could step over right, spicy and exposed!! And I agree that like a lot of Eldo climbs, some of the rock is a bit questionable - you're pretty sure it's solid, but ............

    I onsighted the first pitch today (I have to brag 'cause I'm stoked) and it is awesome - good pro and your fall will be clean at the crux.

Jim Erickson is a bad ass.  Oh, and the first 20 feet of the second pitch has some scary loose blocks.  Cheers.

    I followed this in 98 and fell.  led it in 2003 and fired the whole thing.  Just make sure to rest well before the crux and don't hang out in the middle of it for too long.

    I did this route yesterday 8/31/05. The anchor atop pitch one is nowhere near as bad as I expected from the comments. Maybe it was recently replaced. Now it consists of a pin (solid) and a nut (solid) equalized with a sling.  I think the discussion of an anchor is moot since it is a giant ledge for you to belay from. Protection abounds or just plop down on the ground and wedge your body between rocks with some gear behind you. Now for the actual climb, I went left and found it a little more strenous than the rest of the low 10s I had done in the canyon. I used the crimps out right while I had a bomber left hand jam.  Protection is awesome so if you are thinking of doing 10a. This is not a bad one as you do not need to worry about protection just the climbing.

    Blind Faith was a difficult lead for me, one that I would not consider a novice 5.10 leader to attempt. The crux moves are harder than Tagger, Over the Hill, and March of Dimes in my opinion. I climbed the crack on the left (with a nice big fall!).  The crack on the right looked easier, though.      Place a #3 Camalot in the crack near the top of the bulge, work your way up the crack,  crimp like crazy on the holds above the bulge, and try to find foot placements under the buldge (I didn't find any which made this very difficult for me).    Good fun!

    Don't forget to bring your hex's for the first part of the route.  (# 7,8,9)  You can then save your cams for the crux.  You can place a #3 Camalot about 2 feet below the top out.  This is a fun 5.10a route up to the topout, which I won't try to rate.  I finally had to traverse to the right to get over the bulge.    The anchor now consists of a piton, 2 knots, and a bomber nut,  which you should backup.  There is no reason to rap,  the 2nd pitch is fun and only has 1 well protected hard move.

    Followed P1 yesterday... at the crux, feet up as high as possible, palm-forward fist jam with right hand, lay-back left edge of crack with left hand and, with commesurate body position, step up with right foot to surmount bulge. Strenuous, but went well. This will be my strategy when I go back to lead this pitch, along with tape, after looking at my hand today. Should have rested a bit longer before grabbing the lead for P2 as it continues to be quite pumpy. Awesome climb.

    Hey ac-  If we adhere to the old school ratings, Boulder climbers not only can't climb pure cracks but overhangs, slabs, pure face, corners or anyother type of climb.  Here are some ratings from Ament's 1970 edition of "High Over Boulder":  Gorilla's Delight 5.9 "Layback a flake to the 5.7 or 5.8 slab above," Country Club Crack 5.10,  Cussin' Crack 5.5 or 5.6, Final Exam 5.10, Skunk Crack 5.8, Tagger 5.9, X-M 5.9, Black Walk 5.8, T2 5.9 "Start under the overhang and climb out and up to a bolt, "Rosy Crucifixion 5.8, Ruper 5.7, Grand Giraffe 5.8, Super Slab 5.9, Vertigo 5.10, Grandmother's Challenge 5.9, Grand Course 5.9, Break on Through 5.9, Rincon 5.9.     Advances in technology should easiliy make up for any broken or polished holds, missing fixed gear, etc.  Thus the only conclusion to be drawn is the the modern Boulder climber is simply a pathetic wuss.

    I think it should be pointed out that Erickson originally rated this route 9+. I think what Alan Nelson refers to as the "Valley Daze" is the trick for this one. Most climbers in Boulder are not so great at pure cracks as we don't have any. A few months at the Creek or in the Ditch will make this route feel easier.    An anchor on this route will not pass. I say pull the pin and stuck cordalette. If anyone needs to bail, they'll just leave some booty for us. It is also possible from the top of pitch one to climb up and left to the second pitch of West Chimney (5.7).

    I too would recommend the route for the first .10a trad lead, it was my first .10a trad onsight. I certainly found Blind Faith much easier than Break on Through, but then I feel very comfortable on hand jams.      The fixed "anchor" at P1 is definitely sketchy. I certainly would not rap  from it. Finish the climb with the second pitch and walk off. P2 is alittle easier and less consistent than P1, but still worth doing.

    "... is a bolted anchor more visually unobtrusive than a nest of ratty slings?" As you well know, Joe, one of the early goals of the FHRC was precisely to remove the unsightly mass of slings that had decorated Eldo for so long. In wilderness areas we are not even "allowed" to leave those slings. While I have no feelings one way or the other for placing anything on Blind Faith, a well concealed Fixe anchor has the advantages of durability and reduction of the nest of ratty slings. The bottom line in this debate should be directed toward the consideration that making any change constitutes an improvement to the climb -  in all regards and dimensions. If you rap off a tree that has a nest of ratty, and often rotten, slings, what will you do? You will add to the mass of slings, that's what you will do, and that is part of the problem of having so many people climbing these routes. An analogy: did the trails up the Redgarden and the West Ridge help in any way? We had all humped around the nasty climber's trails for years, and that worked well when the population using the trails was limited. But, with the hordes came more erosion, and the new trails stopped the erosion.

    A bolt anchor at the top of the first pitch will never be approved, so it's not even worth debate.

Ivan, perfect example of my point is that my girlfriend and I climbed it the other day and in the process of clipping up an etrier, a carabiner shifted and pinched the crap out of one of her fingers. We thought it MIGHT be broken, therefore she was in no position to climb pitch two. Are you saying I should have told her to suck it up and climb on (rhetorical)? I understand the suggestion of leaving gear, though read my comment about backing up the existing anchor again...I simply posed a question. The implication within my question was that the FHRC would deny any motions towards shiny new hangars atop pitch one. I didn't make a suggestion.This truly doesn't have to be a bolting-brawl. I just made a vain attempt at providing helpful hints to those who might find themselves in a less-than-ideal situation. Leave the damned anchor as it is. It defines the top of the first pitch, it CAN be backed up, and digging out that knotted cord would be more of a pain in the ass (and potentially scarring to the rock) than leaving it.Forgive me for attempting to use the comments forum as an educational tool for others to use *read "What information would someone who has never climbed this route find useful?"*

    Whoa... I didn't mean to stir up a hornet's nest. I never suggested bolting the stance. I for one would encourage removal of the existing crap anchor. THAT WAY CLIMBERS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN CHOICES, ACTIONS AND SAFETY.  I for one firmly believe that if a piece or anchor is to be FIXED it should be SAFE. BAD fixed gear, particularly anchors invite the very real potential for serious injury.  Make it safe or don't make it at all!

    Scott Conner and Tony Bubb's comments are spot on.  A bolt anchor atop the first pitch of Blind Faith would not be approved by the FHRC unless there was overwhelming public sentiment in favor.This is highly unlikely.  More likely is the complete removal of fixed anchors from this spot.    Bottom line: don't start  up Blind Faith unless you plan to do both pitches.  If you want to rappel after one pitch, be prepared to leave some gear behind.

    If you take this discussion to it's logical conclusion, then either a new anchor has to be placed, or the old one removed completely.I for one would prefer to completely remove the old one. Like people have said, it's bogus.Since you can build a good anchor on trad gear there in the first place it's unneccessary and just leads to people calling for bolts.    There are plenty of multi-pitch climbs in Eldo that don't have or require bolted anchors on top of P1. This is just one more of those. So I suppose I could totally fix this problem by removing the in-situ anchor... just as well as we could by adding bolts. Or maybe we could just leave it as it is and people can just place trad gear to suppliment it.     I don't see any precident for bolting more of the park so that we can turn more climbs into 1-pitch TR's. If a pin and a bad cord set the precident, we should start removing the pins and bad cords, not just bolting stuff.    I'm not anti-bolt. I'm just anti-bolt-everything.

    In keeping with the flow, I'm putting this here, though the last several posts should be moved to the Eldo Fixed Hardware thread.    I don't want to see a bolted anchor go in on top of P1 of Blind Faith.  This would be strictly for convenience.  The "anchor" that is there now is an ad hoc job and should probably be removed all together.  It wasn't built for the masses.  There are enough gear placements on that ledge to build your own anchor and leave your own gear if you need to retreat.  Do those in favor of a bolted anchor here want to bolt the first pitch of all of the multipitch climbs in Eldo?    I say no bolts on Blind Faith and here's why: Eldo is a trad area.  This is a two pitch climb.  The quality of the second pitch is as good as the first. The difficulty of the second pitch is less than the first.  The walk off is easy.

    William,    If you're not ready for the route as is, you are responsible for getting down. Leave gear if necessary. Else wait until you are ready. This is an unnecessary convenience anchor in my opinion.    In any case, this discussion should be continued in eldo fixed hardware (Editorials (Ranting)).    Ivan

    Casey, I'm inclined to agree with you in that this is one of the worst anchors in the park. Has someone submitted a request for bolts/chains yet? This was my second time up the first pitch of Blind Faith (one variation each), and both times I have felt the anchor was safe. Something ANY party should do if rappelling off this anchor is to back it up with trad gear, but don't equalize it. This will give confidence to the first brave soul and assure the second climber that the anchor holds. Obviously if one equalizes the anchor, this is not possible, so place the back-up in 'leading-style' below the webbing that is the anchor.     Ivan, I also found that when I seconded the first pitch I was too tired to lead or even second pitch 2. This was before i was climbing nearly everyday and before I had the same endurance I have now, but it is a challenge to get on that effectively stiff 5.9 after the first. Hey, sometimes you just gotta go for the one-pitcher!Cheers!~Wm

    Is it too much to expect you to put in some gear to make the anchor safe, climb to the top (interesting), and do the easy walk off?

    I really like this route! However the anchor atop P1 is BULLDOOKIE!  It is worth considering doing this route in one nice long pitch to avoid lingering at a crappy anchor.  It annoys and amazes me that on a route of this quality and popularity that the anchor has not been fixed. It is not a nostalgic honor to the style of the 1st ascent to leave this anchor as is, as the 1st ascent was 3rd class. It is negligent lunacy! If you want dangerous anchors and adventure go climb in the Black Canyon or Bugaboos. But this is the front range and a very public area. Let's all get real, survivable anchors are a GOOD thing. Dicey and Spicey are great but not on this route!

    Casey, the knotted cordalette combined with the piton holds just fine. Rapped off it yesterday (though nervous) and it held. However, the stoppers that Jackie mentions haven't been there since mid-summer to my best recollection.     Not a bad route to practice/learn aiding on. I aided the roof on the right yesterday evening late and had a good time. Were I to do it again, I would place a nut in the crack above the roof (Tony's salvation hold, though the climb would still go free as a good .10b) and put a nice runner on it. That way, there isn't horrible rope-drag from the green alien that protects the inside of the roof, and your second will have two clipping points for the roof proper (aside from being the same piece). It was just too damn cold to get the free onsight... *I know... excuses, excuses...*~Wm

    I'd agree with the previous comment. Maybe some comments don't explicitly specify this, but it IS the mantle at the top that is the crux, not the crack below (although strenuous, which saps energy for the crux). It is during this mantle that I fell on my onsight attempt. The jam at the back of the ledge SUCKS.

    Yeah, that last rattler half-in half-out jam with loose little pebbles and sand scrunching around in it is sweet if you know proper crack climbing technique.  Whatever!

    I gotta make another post on this route...I have since learned how to hand jam, and I must say that this is the easiest and most secure 10 that I've done. No crimping or anything except jamming should be going on here, and there are jams to get you over the end of the overhang as well. With adequate crack skills, every jam should be a jug!
    Oct 16, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I found the crux crack jams are a bit slippery, (although that was probably my sweaty fingers). I got worked pretty good busting thru, even with the security of a rope from above. I found it to be an awkward crack, and once in it, not easy getting off your arms, since your out of balance, leaning backwards. There is a stem for the left foot higher up, and a crimper out right halfway thru, but still quite pumpy. I want to work this again, to see what I'm missing. The P2 crux is not as strenuous, but just as awkward.  A great, reasonably long route, where you're technique will be challenged in a few spots. Great exposure...look forward to getting on the sharp end of this route. Erickson's FA 1972 solo of this climb is remarkable...

    I hesitate to add anything since there's already a veritable book going on this climb, but I didn't see any mention of the variation to the second pitch. (Maybe it's a different climb?) Try traversing up left from the belay station at the end of the first pitch. After 15 feet it heads straight up a nice dihedral that will give you a little more crack time. It felt solid 5.9 to me, then lets up to 5.6ish stuff the last 30 feet to the top. Enjoy...

    I climbed this yesterday. I have just recently been breaking into 5.10s, at Eldo and Lumpy primarily. This was my 3rd Eldo 5.10 and I had yet to take a lead fall at this grade.  But this one did it!    I think it is hand-size dependent, a little. I have thin hands and it was getting a little wide for me at the top. Also, would have helped to have known about the crimper to the right, which I didn't use, even when I reascended and topped it off. Also, don't bother placing too much gear in the bulge crack, which saps energy and isn't very beneficial--the fall is super-clean and I didn't feel a thing. Well-protected, so that is a plus for early 5.10 leads, but steep, overhanging, and strenuous, so not that great if you are used to "typical" Eldo climbing, which isn't very crack-y. Maybe good practice for an Indian Creek trip.    Oh, easiest 5.10 at Eldo (for breaking the grade): Positively 4th St. This was my first and I had no problem. Steep, juggy, well-protected, short.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Well, it's not just sport-wankers that may get worked on BF. If you've been climbing mainly in Eldo (where real crack climbing is rare), this could seem pretty tough as a first 5.10. First time I did it, it felt p.f. hard for a 10a (I **thought** I was a good crack climber). About a month later, after my first Indian Creek trip, I did it again, and it felt downright E-Z for it's grade. Someone with lots of mileage on Lumpy 5.9 cracks would probably cruise it as a first 10.     BTW, my first 5.10 was Break On Through, and I thought it protected very well -- maybe too well, as I got got overly pumped sewing it up like crazy (got the onsight though). Also, my 2nd 5.10 was the Tagger roof (also onsight). Why do people think it's dicey? There's a perfect 2.5 friend right at the lip. It's a stretch to place it, but you have a primo #1FR 1/2-way out the roof protecting that move.

    IMHO, if anyone is searching for a good first .10 Eldo lead, try Handcracker on the West Ridge.  It is a great summit route, with two pitches of moderate .9 climbing before the 10a crux pitch to warm up on.  It also protects as well as any of the other 10- climbs mentioned here.  The  moves are much more straight forward (hand jams) than B.F. ....it may even be a bit soft for the grade, an Eldo rarity.kc

    As of 2/22/03, the first pitch "anchor" consists of a single angle piton and a knotted cord.  Be careful on the second pitch about 20 feet off the belay - there are a couple of loose, wedged blocks that people have clearly been yarding on.

    Those of us who have gotten our butts kicked at indian creek should not worry about the "crack climbing" which is often optional (except for one move). Once you get to the overhanging section there are nice holds and one huge jug to place a bomber cam. Reach up from the jugg, get a hand jam, and grovel your way up to the top via sketchy insecure moves (with a beautifully clean fall(s), trust me I know)....also don't get suckered into the offwidth before the crux, there is protected face climbing to the right of it.

    Very nice climb with short crux. Thier is a faring hand jam at the very top which will get you over the top with ease, not obvious.

    THE FIRST PITCH ANCHORS ARE GONE. Well kind of; the anchor now consists of a knotted cord and a flexing pin equalized to a single piece of webbing with no rap ring. Now you have to do the second pitch (which is quite fun) and rapping after the first is more or less out of the question. This anchor should really be entirely removed or a better fixed anchor put in place.casey bernal
    Jun 25, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    My 2 cents on the first pitch: fun climbing, 5.9+, nice hand crack, bomber gear, tricky topout, and BAD anchor. The anchor consists of an angle, a fixed tricam, and a knotted cord - all equalized to a single rap ring (part of the webbing can be used to back up the ring). The only nice thing at the belay spot is that you can back it all up or just put in your own anchor. It would probably be better to set a new anchor and continue on so you don't have to use the bad anchor. This whole mess should be replaced OR removed entirely (it is amazing how two bolts *the B word* would clean this up nicely). Also, if you love cracks you will cruise this one grinning the whole way. Crimpmasters will suffer.  Casey Bernal

    I read this discussion with great interest and went out to do the route yesterday.  I hadn't done for it 15 years and remembered it with pain on the backs of my hands. Still painful, still 3 stars!  My only comment is that I would reverse the ratings of the regular route and the variation.  I think the handcrack is 10c and the roof on the right is 10a!  (we did both while we were up there.)  On the question of whether this is a good first trad lead, I would say that it is, but only if you've followed a bunch of handcracks first.  It's tough to learn hand jamming technique on the sharp end on this one since it's fairly steep/stenuous.
    Apr 15, 2002

    I climbed Blind Faith yesterday and it was my first 10a lead in Eldo.  I have to say that I found the bulge below the belay to be surprisingly hard.  Now I am not a very strong crack climber and I also took my first fall, on gear I placed,leading trad from the crux.  I admit that I felt this was a good first 5.10 lead for me because it was so easy to protect and it actually boosted my confidence knowing that I could take a fall on a cam I placed.  After going back up to the crux, I realized, as with so many aspects of climbing, that if you get your feet up as high as possible it makes the crux a lot easier and getting super good foot jams will relieve some arm pump.  Anyway, enjoy this route.  It is definitely a challenge and an experience worthy of your time.  And that's what we're all here for right? the experience

    I definitely agree with the two Steves' comments above... The fact is that this climb is exceptionally well-protected for an Eldo climb and for that reason it is a great first .10 lead.  Also, it is really not as hard as Charles makes it out to be...for a crack route that is.  Of course, everyone should be aware of the fact that crack climbing requires different technique, greater stamina, and a vastly different repetoir of moves than sport climbing.  This is probably why this climb might be difficult for the sport-master who finds climbs like Rosy and .12 bolt-ups easy but struggles on this fine crack-fest.  For those adept at cracks, its a great first .10 lead, with "jam, jam and jam some more" being the best beta I can offer.  Obviously, if you havent climbed .8 or .9 cracks yet, this ones probably not for you...but it certainly won't hurt to try it.

    All I can say is that I had a damn hard time with the crux  on P1.  I had to hang twice before I found a greasy  crimper out to the right of the crack.  The second time I  climbed it, it wasn't much easier.  For me, it is certainly  one of the meanest 5.10a's I've done in the canyon.  I've  had far less difficulty with Chockstone, Grand Course,  etc.

    I found the gear and holds on the beginning of the second pitch to be of poor quality.  I was new to Eldo the first time I did it, and although I was on-sighting 5.11s, and a lot of R rated routes, but I had some concern for my safety on this route for gear quality.    A few years later I did it again.  Peter Spindloe lead it in the snow and took a few nice falls off of the P1 crux. I lead P2 and don't recall being as intimidated by it that time, but that was after doing 100s of routes in Eldo.  Since then, I've lead it all as a single 60M pitch 3 times and had no concerns. I guess that just means it is in the eye of the beholder.    And who is the Joker? After climbing the "5.10c" variation I'll pipe up. It's 5.9 if you are over 5'9". I can imagine a tough reach for short people, but the right-hand variation is pretty easy, and well protected. It would be a good first 5.10 for someone who is climbing 5.9 and is confident of their gear.

    I agree with Steve's comment and most others except  for the bitching ones.It is also a reality that everyone  climbs with differant techniques and syles based on  experience and strength, and possibly luck.  Maybe  when someone puts a comment in here ,or for any  other route that the writer should keep their opinion of  whether it is a good first lead of that grade to themself  as we are all differant in our own styles.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I can't disagree with any of the previous remarks....I'll  just say that I find it much easier to set up for the last move by.......... jamming with the right hand at the top of the crack, moving the right foot as high as possible and then reaching up and over with the left, jamming in the slot towards the back. This allows me to palm with my right with my weight already above the bulge.    I think any 5.10 with protection as good as this one has is a good one to choose for your first. You may not  flash it but you can always come back another day.     One note: I've known people to get in trouble on the second pitch for one reason or the other. A GOOD ALTERNATIVE is to climb up and left from the belay and connect with the WEST CHIMNEY route. After 30' or so  look for the little traverse to the right past a fixed pin. If  daylight is fading this may be a better choice that the regular second pitch. A better fixed anchor for rappelling  would be worth considering too.
    Nov 6, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A lot of bickering over such a short route. My take on the situation is this, the first pitch of the route is very very nice and gives a surprising pump at the crux. Hopefully you can reach high enough to place that piece before committing to the crux. (especially if this is your first 10 lead). Pull down on the hueco and left hand jam, throw the right foot up high and DON'T look straight up for something positive, the good holds are to the left of the little roof two parallel crimps which can get your feet over the 10c variation and up to the anchor, which is quite a masterpiece in itself. The second pitch is decent but nothing to the first, a little more difficult than it may appear at first, watch for loose block for first 20' of P2. We were 'Blind' indeed, doing the last pitch in almost pitch black ! Damn dayight savings time.

    Geez, time to get the discussion forum section going on this site.  Anyway, I did only P1 of BF last Nov. - my partner insisted that she was done upon reaching the ledge.  Anyway, it is neither the best nor the worst choice for a first 10 lead.  It does sew-up very well. Due to the overall steepness of the route, especially the top, any half-way competent leader should be safe taking a fall.  Also, one can tell by looking at the route from the ground (or reading the detailed beta in the above comments), that it is essentially a cake walk until the upper section.  The statement about the "5.12" sport climber does not surprise me and hopefully does not lead anyone to believe that the route is sand-bagged.  Someone I know who boulders harder than me fell seconding this route.  My overall evaluation of this route (P1) is it is 2 stars, plenty safe and 10-.

    Whew! It is refreshing to hear that maybe Blind Faith is as hard as I thought it was. My 2nd 10 trad lead in Eldo.

I tried Northcutt today as my 4th Eldo 10 lead...you can read my comments yourself, but hey, the ring pin holds!     For the record, if anyone wants to email along their idea of easy eldo 10s, I'd love to hear.

    Chockstone "textbook nuts from good stance?"  Ouch!  Better be tall or good at blind placements - I use a black Alien which I can't confirm until I'm into the move.

(Sorry to detour from Blind Faith, just following the collective train of discussion.)

    I disagree with the comments that this is a good first 5.10 lead, although of course everyone is different.  The moves over the bulge seemed awkward and desperate--that was the crux, not the straightforward crack moves.    My advice-- try Chockstone (one tricky move, textbook nuts from a good stance), Break on Through (ditto), P1 Outer Space (if you like stemming--great pro but the sequence is kind of bizzare).  Of course I'm revealing my biases toward climbing that has tricky, short sequences with good stances to figure them out--but most people I know prefer routes like that as breakthroughs.  On the other hand I believe Ben M.'s first ten lead was Tagger which I don't want to lead even now and I don't know what category that fits in, so what the hell...    I'll shut up now :)

    After climbing BF the other day, my partner &amp; I watched a party top out on Cream - looked like great climbing, really neat position (summits a slender pinnacle atop the Bastille's West Face), and some rather spartan use of small wires or RPs.

    Maybe it's handsize-dependent, but for me this really is a good breakthrough route into Eldo 10a.  The gear is great, you can place all the high pro you want and back down to a ledge to rest, and, for me, I feel it's one of the easier 5.10a routes in the canyon (and I'm the guy who HATES when people say that about a route they have wired).  But it also fits my own style - dumb and strong, no footwork, and like I said it fits my hands (average male).  A tiny bit of beta helps - at the overhang, jamming high with the left hand allows use of a big hueco in the crack and also sets you up to reach the blind crimper over the bulge (at about 2 o'clock) which helps the mantle.  Two steep jams, a mildly grunting mantle (all with good pro) and it's over.  Sentimental favorite for me, my first Eldo 10a and a confidence boost when I've needed it.

If you feel OK with holding giant jugs, leaning back slightly, and placing easy-to identify cams and a couple nuts, then do this climb. There is very little groundfall potential as long as you know how to stick cams in a basic crack or nuts in a clear v-slot, which any 5.8 leader should be able to do.    Bomber pro, great position. Do it! Watch out for loose rock at the belay, fist-sized pieces could easily make their way to the trail below or your belayer.

    I agree with Jayer and others.  While this is a good route [fairly] rated, it would be (is?) spooky off the ground for a beginning 5.8 leader.

    Not sure what you mean by "not a good route for the beginning 5.8 leader" as the route is easily protected and only requires a little [commitment] after the cam at the lip. I would submit that this is an excellent route for the beginning 5.8 leader.
    Nov 4, 2005

    Protect the crux with a #1 Camalot @ 1 o'clock from the old pin, which is unnecessary.  I would not recommend this climb for the beginning 5.8 leader.  Huecos are fun.

    I believe the route to the left is a Hersey route called Overhanging Talus (5.10d S). With a name like that, you can understand why there is not a line.    Although I have not climbed either of these routes, the route New [Chautaqua] (5.10c) is to the right of Breakfast in Bed.
    Sep 8, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    No need to clip the old pin,  there is a perfect #1 Camalot placement at the lip.  I think the old pin is part of a different route which is rated 5.10d.  This route joins "Breakfast in Bed" after about 30ft.  There is also a fixed nut on this adj. route.     This route felt harder than "Hair City" due to the pumpy nature of placing gear.  Fun stuff....

    This route didn't offer much to interest me.  There was a lot of rope drag due to zig-zag climbing at the start.  I was unimpressed by the huecos as they are not the crack that Rossiter [described]. Looking for a 5.8 crack?  Try Star Wars on Lower Peanuts wall just 5 minutes farther uphill.

    I'm with you George! I found this climb to be rather tricky at the bottom, too. The [balance] is just hard to dial in before you get into the main crack. A stiff 8 for sure, IMO. A very nice line, however.       -Tim Stich

    From the name, this route appears a casual cruise -- but it is not!  If you don't notice the hold mentioned by Ron (it is not that obvious) you can pump yourself silly searching left and right for the easiest way.  Once you find it, the next few moves are very committing and it overhangs slightly, making pro placement strenuous.  Also a few of the handholds in this section are thin and might snap off.    Beyond this the difficulty eases, although it is still amazingly steep.  This climb is much better than it looks from the ground!
    Jun 6, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I love this climb!  The crux is directly off the ledge and yes, you want your piece to be bomber.  I place a red Camalot in a slot on the edge of the mantle...quickly pull up and reach for the bomber hold as Ron mentioned on the left-facing dihedral.  The climb continues to back off the higher you go.  This is a long fun pitch.  You can walk off the standard Bastille descent.

    Kreighton-you found the knee bar.  Nice, huh!?    The traverse out to the base of the climb is a cool element of the climb, but if you want a few more feet of climbing, (must usa a 60mtr for this) start directly under the climb just off-trail and choose from a couple of ways: * There's a licheny slab to a fun bulge or, further right, **a short, thin, overhanging finger crack to a ledge, (through a bush or two!).  Both ways lead up to the starting ledge.  I think they're written up in the guidebook, but I just kinda eyeballed 'em, as they're pretty obvious.    By the way, the 'fixed' nut is no longer there, and at the bottom...sure!  Why not clip the pin.  With a long runner.  Back it up, if you can then go for it!  One of my favorite routes in Eldo. -CL

    Did this Sunday, Oct 6 with James Balasalle. Although a little funky to start, this was acutally a pretty cool pitch, more fun than I expected. Protection requires close examination, but is there. At the start, it is *not* necessary to traverse left and clip an old, upward-driven pin (!). Just plug about a #2 cam/Friend in an obvious vertical slot and go straight up the dihedral. Nearly the entire pitch is overhanging slightly, so look for rest stances. Pro is a mix of medium to small cams and nuts in the cracks along the dihedral, with one place for a big cam (#4 Friend) in a chimney-like recess towards the top. The more you can climb daringly on the big jugs on the outside of the face, the more exposure and adrenaline rush you will have!    The upward driven pin on the traverse out left at the beginning should be removed. It is misleading since the traverse is not needed, and badly placed.
    Oct 8, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I backed off this lead after four tries, not trusting the piton, and a small cam placement I put in loose rock to the right. I just couldn't commit to that first back leaning move on lead. Fearing the ground fall potential I decided to hand the sharp end over to my younger, fearless partner for a go at it.  He had no problem and made it look easy, and its not a super hard move, fairly graded at (8), but if your having a bad day, and do peel...well, you get the idea.  The rest of the route is fun.  It gets pumpy at the halfway point where you have to move out onto the arete and pull up on several huecos. Good exposure on this sustained route but as mentioned above, kinda tricky.
    Oct 3, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There's a bomber placement for a #1 Camalot or #2 Friend above and right of the old pin that protects the initial crux.  Also, there's a great crack handhold in the right wall of the initial corner that simplifies the crank past the above placement.  Once established in the corner, there's a bomber placement for a #3.5 Camalot or #4 Friend. I'm never worried about groundfall potential on this pitch.  Whenver the climbing gets difficult in the corner/chimney, swing right onto the arete and climb  up overhanging jugs instead.
    Jun 29, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Where else but Eldorado Canyon would you find 50 feet or more of back-leaning trad 5.8 with a low ground-fall-potential crux?  The rating is fair, but you wouldn't guess it looking up on the sharp end.  I found Ballnuts a valuable piece of gear for a thin crack that shows up regularly; they set quickly, and when you're getting pumped, due to over-gripping caused by anxiety, that means a lot.
    Jun 24, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If we're talking of the piton that is below and left of the initial dihedral, then I've always started it to the right of that pin. That starts you directly below the overhanging dihedral. These moves are stout, intimidating and not too easy to protect. Blow the moves and you'll probably bounce onto the ledge. I've always thought this was one of the more sustained and tricky 8s in Eldo.  At least one solid Eldo 11 leader I know put in about six pieces before commiting to the initial mantle into the dihedral, but again, this was right of the piton.    When you're getting pumped higher up, remember one word - "kneebar".
    Jun 12, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Which way do you start the climb right above the piton??? I went to the left and did a hard mantle with a marginal nut placement...it definitely felt weird and psychological.

    Chance of Rain - 5.10b/c sClimb up the slab to the left of Rain and follow a poorly-protected seam up to an awkward bulge (8 or 9) past a poor fixed pin (about 10 feet to the right of the 5.9 on the first pitch of the Northwest Corner) to a good stance. Reach left and place pro in the NW corner, then make a funky traverse right (10) to the stance above the roof on rain. Clip another manky fixed pin in a small left facing corner and then climb up and slightly left to a downward pointing flake. Fire in as many TCUs as you can and then climb strait up past a jug and tricky face moves (crux) to another downward-pointing flake. From here, step right and follow rain up to the anchor (5.8 or so).    I would recommend leading this on double ropes and bring double sets of cams up to a #1.5 Friend. A #3 or 3.5 Friend can be placed in the flake past the crux, but it's not that hard going past it and more gear is available. This is a pretty cool route but is a little contrived as one could easily bail onto the NW Corner or Rain. It's a little runout but the cruxes can be bouldered out from good stances with classic Eldo pro (it's there, but you don't want to fall onto it!).

    PS- I recently received this note: "...this route is "a chance of rain" and is in rossiter's (newest) guide book. the pins that were in it are long gone.

    I stepped over onto the face at the lowest place I could.  Definitely not an option for those who are altitudinally challenged.      That first, downward-facing flake flexed the full range on a BD 0.75 when I placed one behind it.  Spooky.  So, I took it back out and my first gear was a slung horn a bit higher.  (Bad fall potential beforehand).  The rest was fun and better protected.  I placed a BD 0.5, a medium nut, looped a keyhole, and slung the top horn (for TR protecting my second).      Interesting moves down low, cool holds up high, great position.  But overall quality is average.  [IMHO that flake should be trundled]

    Boy, if I climbed where you did, that is ballsy use of a TCU/Alien behind a flake... looked pretty bad to me.    I placed gear in the crack in the chimney, a large bomber stopper &amp; bomber Camalot an a long sling, and then headed left.  The first stem would have been hard for a short person.  Then up and left on runout terrian.  I got nothing good in for quite a ways (severe fall potential) and then got several bomber pieces once near or on the pinnacle.  This gear was 1 ea. red &amp; brown tricam + a few large Camalots in the back of huecos + I threaded a few needle-eyes.  Of course, they were creative placememnts, but they were good gear.

    A little history ... we made the first ascent on a very cold December day -- hours before Royal Robbins showed his slide show of the first ascent of Tissaack on Half Dome. I led the first pitch wearing Royal Robbins shoes and, of course, no chalk, maybe with a stopper before that first mantle. After that it was just the 2 bolts. I then placed a small stopper near the lip of the roof. It gave me the heeby-jeebies, so I climbed down and the three of us tugged on it to test it. Jim then went up and led the over hang, and the rest was a walk.

    Led this route for the second time yesterday and remembered it well as one of those trad routes that really grabs your attention right from the start.  The first pitch has so much climbing variety in it, mantling, thin crimpers, jugs, mini laybacks, traverses, and runnout in a nervey 130'.  The finish of P1 can be done 3 ways...straight thru the jugs, over to the right then into the squeeze chimney (highly undesireable IMO), or to the right side of the finish block, then traverse left 15-20' to the corner and up (the money IMO)...very exciting finishing that way (runnout .7ish with BIG exposure there)!   So cool....

    What a phenomenal route!  I was glad to lead it today.  I do think that the S/R rating is appropriate due to the runouts, but the hard moves on the first pitch are well protected.  The 15'-20' runouts between bolts and gear force great focus!    As an interesting variation, I setup a belay to the right of the block after the aesthetic pockets section.  Such a nice belay seat--reminded me of a motorcycle seat (slightly less padded, though)--with a great view to bring up your second.  This is followed by a nice but short squeeze chimney to gain the top of the block.    The roof that is above this block is the money.  Heading right, then up to gain a nice zigzag fingercrack was worthy of 9+ IMO.  Now that I know the sequence it might feel easier next time, but onsighting was, for me, pumpy to commit and place gear; the ledge underneath looked unpleasant.  The zigzagging fingercrack is 7ish, and fun the whole way.

    Fantastic climb on great rock. I only did P1, as my partner wanted to lead the far right upper pitch.  On P1, the holds are mostly big and positive, and really the only tricky move is at the pin starting the pitch.  I do think you want to be comfortable at the grade, but if you are.... get on this route.  There is gear where you need it, and sussing out the path-of-least resistance is pretty straightforward (of course, everything was all chalked up for me).  If it feels too hard, there is probably another way.....

    Although the mantle move down low may be the crux, the balancy move just above the second bolt, was a bit hairy too.  Once you figure it out and move up, good small stopper placements are there.  Up high on P1 I went to the right side, placed a #1 cam in a crack , traversed left to that little horn in the far left upper corner, and up to the top of the block, a series of moves made more exciting with that much rope out!

    Climbed this route for the first time yesterday, what a treat! Runout for sure, but the pro is there at the difficulties. The first pitch is a gem, but don't miss the roof on the second pitch! Though it looks loose and chossy from below, some care on the lower foot holds gets you to super solid hand holds with great moves over the roof, and it's well protected with a bomber sideways #6 Stopper.
    Sep 14, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I did this route last week for the first time.  I think overall it is a harder climb than the West Buttress. Definitely more sustained.  I started the opening moves by using the small ramp for my hands and traversing under the layback. Once under I shot right up through it to the bolt. I have seen other people walk precariously along this ramp as well.  I tried both and felt much better traversing underneath and firing straight up.  I was also able to place a #9 stopper in the small flare at the bottom of the lieback before the pin.  Makes the opening moves a little easier if not safer.  The rest of the climb was great.  The run out is not that bad as it is on solid buckets the whole way.  There are definitely some places where you could get off route especially when approaching the end of the 1st pitch on the detached block.  On the right is blank face so stay left for the easier ground right to the anchors.

    Ed-In response to your comment in response to mine, you are right. I am suggesting that someone climbing this be confident on such terrain at such grade and experienced in placing pro. Otherwise it would not be safe.    I guess I slightly misspoke when I said you MUST NOT fall. I definitely wouldn't have wanted to fall. I trusted most pieces of gear I placed and with so much rope out, the fall factor would be low. If one was to fall during one of the runouts, the benefit of placing gear is that you probably wouldn't die (i.e. hit the ground). Rather you would take a large, scraping, swinging fall and may find yourself with significant injuries--something I strive to avoid. However, that sounds better than death.
    Oct 9, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Matt, I've led and followed it both ways, and it is perfectly doable to go straight up, but a bit harder and more poorly protected.  Stepping right, up, then traversing is the more natural line, although as you say it seems odd to do so--when you step right, why not just continue up the easy chimney?    In fact, that's about the only thing I don't like about this route--it's a bit contrived (on both pitches), and therefore not as committing as comparably graded Eldo hair-fests such as Metamorphosis or Alice in Bucketland.  But purely for the climbing moves, it can't be beat at the grade!
    Sep 16, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Matt, I believe you followed the standard line.  I recall maybe going somewhat right to get over the roof, then heading back left.  Following the path of least resistance is the way to go there (follow the buckets!).  It seems to me this is what Rossiter's topo indicates although he does not have his line going right over the roof (more like straight up).

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Executive summary for Hair City: where a solid 5.8/9 climber needs gear, it is there and obvious. Where the difficulty eases, there are runouts ... none of which are too scary for again - a solid 5.8/9 leader. Probably not the best lead for someone who isn't a solid leader at the grade, but an absolute MUST DO for Eldo enthusiasts. If you need more info to feel comfortable about this one, follow it first to make sure you've got it in the bag. Being solid on 5.8 terrain and confident on 5.9 and even 10 will be a plus for the leader and not take away from the experience and exposure.    One of the best at the grade PERIOD and probably among the best 50 routes in Eldo regardless of the grade.

</blockquote><blockquote>
    I succeeded on the first pitch of this climb yesterday evening.  I found it to be more challenging than other comparable 5.8/9 Eldo climbs.  The middle section of the p1 meanders a bit and the path-of-least-resistance isn't obvious.      The headwall of the first pitch still has me scratching my head.  There is an obvious crack/gash trending left from the stance up the headwall, but it quickly peters out to crimpers.  In contrast, the climbing to the right of this gash is much easier.  I took the path of least resistance and moved up the right part of the headwall (almost to the exit on the right), then traversed left across the face before heading up the slab to the top of the flake.  This seems to be different than the guidebook's route description.      Where do most people generally climb to get through this section of Hair City?  The way I went was so close to the exit, that it seemed contrived to traverse left and then move up the face to the top of the flake.  -Matt Findley

    David, with all due respect, saying you MUST NOT FALL does not really help anybody assess a climb unless it has no pro.  Otherwise what is the point of placing protection?  Do you mean that you would not want to fall at any point on this climb?  If so did you not trust any of your placements?    It sound like you are suggesting someone who attempt this should either be very confident that they will not fall except perhaps on the protected crux(s) or that they should be very good at placing pro.

    Regarding the rating:    One comment said it is 5.9, NOT 5.9+. I think the first pitch is maybe 5.9-, but lots of 5.8. It is the second pitch roof that is 5.9+.    Another disagreed with the S rating. If you are a solid 5.9 climber, experienced with tricky pro and confident in your placements, you may not "feel" runout on it. However, the S rating is to warn those that may be breaking into the grade or less experienced with pro of what they may be getting into. This is definitely warranted in this case. You MUST feel comfortable on 5.8 terrain, you MUST place pro opportunistically and in somewhat tricky ways, and you MUST NOT fall.    I think part of the fun is just finding your way up the wall. Who needs a detailed description on this route? It isn't tricky, just look for the easiest way and go.
    May 12, 2003

    To AC - regarding routefinding....  you make a good point.  Looking up at the wall, find the large block/ledge a rope-length above you.  The first pitch finishes by surmounting a bulge at the base of this block and angling left (runout except for a funky big stopper placement) and then up just left-of-center. To get to this block you'll find the 'bucket ladder' directly beneath. Getting to the first bucket is a bit runout but 5.6ish. It sounds like this is the point you reached. If you get to the bulge at the base of the block and don't like the looks of it you can easily escape to the right. Good luck.

    I seem to recall clipping a fixed pin near the bottom right side of the big belay flake (near the West Arete belay cleft), moving more or less straight left and slightly up from the pin, and then gaining a line of good holds near the left arete of the flake, which is followed to the belay spot.  Just good old devious Eldorado face climbing, not crimps of death.

    Did this today and loved it!!  Another Eldo classic!  While I would agree with everyone above that the runouts aren't that big a deal (the climbing is solid, you can find occasional stoppers, etc.), I would disagree with the idea of not calling this an "S" rated climb.  It IS a runout route.  In general, the climbing is not harder than 5.7 in the runouts, but this ain't no sport route with a piece every 6-8 feet (and I'm glad it isn't).  The fact that we all feel comfortable on it is great, but lets keep in mind that the purpose of this site is to provide beta.  If you are just breaking in to 5.9, this route will most likely scare you.  But, if you are used to Eldo climbing and haven't done it, go do this route!  It earns its 3 stars.

    I find the hardest move on this route is the mantle near the start.  Once I was not concentrating (having led the route several times) and nearly lost my balance doing the move.  As I recall there is a pin 5' below you here, but if it pulls or your belayer is asleep you could hit the ground.  The middle of the first pitch is runout but it is very easy there.  There are some large solution pockets in this section that will be full of water if you climb after a heavy rain (no problem, just unexpected).
    Oct 7, 2002

    I have done this route many times and feel it does not need to be rated serious. Reason being is that the first pitch can be well protected w/ some creative pro just left of the second bolt, the 1st pitch headwall also can take 3 to 4 placements, again w/ a good eye for the placements.

    The aformentioned "loose and runout climbing up to the crux"  at the start of pitch 2 is only runout if you choose not to  place gear. There is a good small cam placement before  entering the steep section below the crux. Use long draws on  this and the next piece and you can reach the top in one  long pitch with no rope drag. I Don't bring anything larger  than a .75 Camalot for this route, it's one of my favorite.

    Near the top of the first pitch, just before it gets overhung for a few moves, there is a really solid #9 Stopper placement.  This is directly below the left-slanting undercling crack in a little slot. This piece provides a little reassurance as opposed to placing iffy cams in the crack.

    I did this one just a few months back and my overall assesment was that it was just plain dirty and flaky - which would have left me with the impression that it would be better as a TR - presuming for a moment that it would be worth the effort of setting one up. However, it isn't. I concur with the bomb rating Leo gives it. There are higher quality routes that are just as obscure.

    As per the note above abut a yellow Alien in solid rock - yeah, maybe, but it just blew out on Saturday and that's changed. So don't count on that at this point. I went for the route again after running a trail race with no warm up and couldn't get my feet high. I jumped off from a few feet above that cam and ended up taking a 40' fall when it went out.    Luckily, I'd told my partner I expected that, so I had placed a few small Aliens below that and ended up 8' off of the ground.    Don't take P1 casually.

    The "jug" on the first pitch is hard to reach if you are not tall. Once you have it, the rest of the first pitch is easier, and there is a pod to rest in right after the crux.

    I led the first pitch recently. I was able to get a yellow Alien at the start of the roof in solid rock. I'm not sure it would keep you from hitting a ledge if you blew the crux move but at least you wouldn't be falling onto the gear in the mudstone below the roof.

    2nd pitch: great pro (including a #3 1/2 Camalot), super fun, very steep.

    An ascent of this route should include P2 for full value.  The pitch is significant, worthy, and fun.
    Aug 23, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    P1 PG-13 for sure, though not at the crux level. P2 is fun though a bit unnerving off the ground. If you come off the thin face to the first pro, you'd easily break an ankle. "R" rating for this on the upper pitch.
    Jun 17, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Great route with much better climbing than I imagined after looking it over from the ground. It was a little spicy but never seriously runout, and the cruxes had gear at your waist or above. The upper slab is a little tricky, but as someone mentioned earlier, you can sling a decent chickenhead/pebble off to your right for some pro. After that, it's one big move up to a jug and then good gear to the top.
    Apr 17, 2015
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Runout to block/flake 30ish feet.    Placing gear behind it isn't necessarily inspiring.  The route is super good though, really fun climbing.  Good inverted #2 halfway up route.
    Jul 22, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The first pitch of the climb is not as bad as some of the comments make it appear.  The run-outs are on easy terrain, and cruxes can be protected if you're willing to spend the time looking for solid placements.  I used a lot of nuts on pitch one and a R.P. above the mantle.  The second pitch is much headier I.M.O., slippery feet on the slab and I had to cut my feet loose to pull the overhang.
    Jun 24, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Be aware that the entire first rising traverse off the deck on P1 is now essentially unprotectable (as of 07/09). A flake that once could be used for pro at the end of the traverse has become very loose. (It's actually just barely hanging on). That has compromised the integrity of the neighboring flake, as well, which used to have a great nut placement. That means that you're run out 30 feet before a good piece of pro at the 5.7 grade. What a great climb, though!
    Jul 9, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I thought the run out up the slab and the roof on pitch two warranted a .9 rating. The crux on pitch one seemed about .8ish though. Fun climb.
    May 22, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A few days ago, I had to re-climb this on TR to get a nut out. I lowered to the ground to get the nut tool, got the nut, and then, at the mantle move, moved left and up over a featured face into a left facing corner that led to the upper easy climbing. Fun climbing, but it would be pretty runout on the lead. I saw some chalk down and left that looked like someone was considering climbing straight up to the left-facing corner, but there's a pretty blank steep section blocking the way.
    May 1, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Climbed the first pitch of this route a few days ago, right after climbing Breakfast In Bed. IMHO, this climb is not nearly as difficult nor as serious a lead, but much more esthetic. A bit runout, but all of the crux moves were made from relatively good stances and were protected by fairly decent pro. A lot of fun, though it didn't seem as hard as 5.9 to me.
    May 10, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Man!  Finally got around to doing this!  I feel like it was just a bit easier than Breakfast In Bed.  I'd give both that climb and this one an 8+.  The second pitch is also a blast.  To avoid the 's' slab,  I started far left and got a decent piece in before traversing up to the roof.  The roof indeed has good holds around the corner, but you ARE hanging it out there!  Very fun.

    This would be a 3 star on the West Ridge.  Pitch 1 is steep and continuous for the grade (whatever it is) -- pretty darn fun.  P2 is basically two moves, but still adds some value.
    Jun 22, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree with a previous comment that the mantel isn't as hard asa 5.9.  A friend of mine lead breakfast in bed the same day andit sounded like his mantel was much more difficult than mine.I however didn't like the pro placement before the 5.8 sectionat the top.  I found myself about 20 feet above my last placement(just after the crux mantel) and placed two very sketchy pieces which Idon't think I would have trusted body weight to.  Is it possiblethat I missed some good placements in the 5.5 section?  In any caseI enjoyed the climbing, but would warn climbers about the proplacement at the top of P1.  Also, in the 5.8 section, going straightup on small holds and moving left although looks rather uninvitingat first is not as bad as it looks.  The feet I thought were really good.Alex Olivas.
    Jun 9, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    For the "unprotectable slab move" on P2, you can sling a decent small horn (a large round pebble) on the right. With the belayer down and left from the start, this horn is quite good. If you come off you'll still hit the big horizontal crack, but the horn should keep you from going all the way to the walk-off ledge.
    May 30, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There is a pretty fun variation listed in the guidebook for pitch 2: Go up the left side of the slab and turn the roof at a thin crack (10d/11a). Gotta say, although it's short-lived, this is pretty damn hard for the grade and a wee bit hairy to protect. Did I mention reachy?
    Aug 6, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Quick comment-Did the route for the 3rd time today, and realized a good way to keep the rope out of the roof crack atop the 2nd pitch is to brinng a #2 Camalot or equivalent for a pothole about 5 feet right of the belay ( a straight in crack 15 feet above the roof).  This will keep the rope to the 2nd climbers right (out of the crack) and make it easier to belay.  Otherwise it has a tendency to get caught in the sharp finger crack at the crux move while you belay your second.
    Jun 20, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    FWIW, I thought it protected fairly well (the first pitch at least). Pitch 2 continues up and slightly right up a slab before turning an awkward looking, off-width/chimney crack/roof. It's actually hands and a finger lock once you get up there, but there's a tricky move on the clean face that is unprotectable - THIS warrants an s rating, I believe. Anyways, turn the corner and follow the easy climbing another 15 feet to the ridge and belay. I thought this was definitely better than 1 star, 2 stars in my book.
    Sep 5, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This was a good climb.  I think my entertainment came from the assortment of quality moves.  I didn't do a route submittal since I did not do P2.  Anyway, the "s" rating may be warranted as Kristo suggests since some of the placements behind the hollow flakes are questionable and well spaced.  My partner and I felt that this pitch was 5.8.  However, I would recommend Blind Faith (10-) to the 5.8 leader before this climb due to the nature of the protection.

    Ermahgerd! If a sport route and a trad route drank tea and made a baby, this bundle of ten perfect bits would be it! In the "roof crux", I got a bomber hand jam, then a bomber tight fist, and once I pulled the bulge and stood up, voila! A hueco mouth waiting to go nom, nom, nom on a perfect cup! Perhaps this one was made for 5'2" climbers with #1 sized hands. I fired straight up direct to the anchors, and indeed, I think it a bit too run out for my mental happiness, but, as they say, you get what you get and you don't pitch a fit. Wow.

    Fun climbing. Challenging and pretty safe. After getting a TCU (yellow?) under the roof, I had gear every 6-9 feet if needed for the challenging bits and then a piece or two for the easy slab above.

    Fun movement with spicy run-outs.  This climb definitely has two distinct crux sections.  A 60 meter rope will work fine if you swing uphill when rapping off.

    Awesome!  Looking at the routes on the Bastille in the database, it seems that folks are awfully stingy with stars for this formation.  I give it 3 (or at least 2 and a half) stars.

    Nov 12, 2001

    I use a couple of the smallest TCU's at the first set of  overlaps and then a #3 Camalot in the middle of the  larger bulge. This can be placed before committing  yourself to the underclings and I think using a full sling  on it is a good idea.   I don't think going to the second bolt is the best way to  go. The route was done for many years by going  straight above the first bolt. The second bolt seems  superfluous and misleading, it was replaced relatively  recently and tends to lead you around to the anticlimatic  lower-angled face to the right.    The direct finish is brilliant. The difficulties ease  quickly and the holds are positive but the climbing is  steep and unprotected. I've thought that continuing the pitch by going left  around the corner and heading up the NW CORNER  would be a good thing to do but haven't done it yet. A fall  from the crux of that would be spectacular.   If you are attracted to SHINE be advised there is some  loose rock up there.

    This route is just fun. Almost like the anti-Eldo in that it's well-protected and full of jugs. Not that committing, once you get past the pin and the potential ledgefall at the start. After the crux at the first bolt, the rest is a jug-haul cruise.
    Sep 27, 2016
</blockquote><blockquote>
    No beta: I think that before the crux is 9+ and after the crux is something between 5.9 and 10a depending on your stamina. Before the first bolt, the pin backs up with a perfect nut (extend w/ sling), and a tiny cam a few feet up (also extend) will prevent a whip if you somehow blew the first bolt.

    Looks like the pin is new(ish) as it is not even rusted.   You can back it up with green Alien or small nuts.   It's all good once you get the 1st bolt above the pin.

    My gear (other than bolts/piton):  #1 Camalot before piton, nut after piton (can't remember which one but about size of little purple TCU), and slung horn up high (not necessary but cut down on somewhat spacey (but reasonable) bolts.  Not many (or perhaps any!) routes like this in Eldo--a real sport climb (with a small bit of supplemental gear as noted).  Lots of fun; I wish there more.
    Oct 4, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Lots of fun, the start looks intimidating but is pretty solid.  A small RP can back up the pin and a blue Alien/blue TCU can be found at the ledge before getting to the first bolt.  It is also pretty easy to clip the first bolt and downclimb for a rest.  This was my hardest redpoint and onsight in Eldo to date, felt easier than some 10s though.  I'd like to call it 11a, but other routes of the same grade seem harder (first p. Genesis, Vertigo, C'est La Vie).  People who haul overhanging jugs at the gym will do fine on this.  A warm up on Hair City yesterday was perfect before Sunset Boulevard.
    Apr 23, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I too enjoyed this route and agree that it is soft for Eldo--I felt like I was on the beach in Thailand while powering through the jugs while clipping bolts (in more ways than one).  I wasn't sure of the grade beforehand and thought it was hard 10 or easy 11 (not that I am an authority).  The runouts were totally manageable on easier ground but I did place some gear (equalized two small tcus)in the stratum below the first bolt as I didn't know what I was getting into.  In hindsight, the clip wasn't bad.  All in all, this helped my ego in contrast to all the sketchy 10+/11-s in Eldo.
    Jun 4, 2007

    Though it's too new to be in the Boulder Climbs South guide, I've seen folks on it and kept marching on by without giving it a second thought.  I'm happy that tradition ended and we jumped on it finally.  The bolts are in good spots, but I backed up the pin out of habit.  If you blow the first bolt and your belayer is narcoleptic, you could deck I guess.  The moves through the first and second roofs are exquisite and the slab work past the white round inclusion was superb.  The end left me wanting more, kind of like a slutty supermodel lingerie show.
    Sep 1, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A point of clarification to the ac who thought the 2nd bolt above the crux was unnecessary.  I added that bolt to protect the second. Without it, a fall at the crux while following the pitch sends the second into space and necessitates lowering to the ground and starting over.
    Aug 19, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Hey folks, climbed this one for the first time in a few years onsighted (loved) it the first time, got spanked the second time, flashed (loved) it the third time, the first time up the route was right after it went up and the thing that impressed me the most was the quality of rock/movement and the well spaced bolts. Except for the second bolt, I found the second bolt to be unnecessary and a real energy sucker AND out of character with the well spaced bolts on the rest of the route - my advice to those who follow is to ignore the bolt and go for the good holds. I understand that this bolt may take some of the commitment off the edge of the crux move but climbing in Eldo requires commitment even when on a sport/mixed route.  Also, having climbed the route before and after the newly installed chain anchor.  I found the route to be more enjoyable, in the style of Eldo climbing, when the route continued to the ledge - c'est la vie = have fun - thanks, Chris.

    I did this route yesterday and it was great.  I thought the bolts were perfect and although I had extra gear on me I did not place any.  The wall looks intimidating as it is overhung the whole way but there are some great rests (no hands) and all jugs. Just keep pulling clipping and you will get through it. Amazing position and a great route to jump on on the way down the Bastille from another route.

    There is now a beefy, two bolt 'sport anchor' that allows a true sport climbing experience, right here in Eldo. (The Action Committee for Eldo web site reveals that this was applied for and approved in the Fall of 2002). This anchor makes this a really fun, quick sport route to do before work. A 60m rope was plenty long for the TR/rap off - the application on the ACE site states that the anchor is "97 feet above the ground".
    Jun 12, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Excellent route.  It feels like an 11-, but you almost forget that you are in Eldo. There's definitely no need for sketching around trying to will an RP into the rock, I did it out of old habit going for the onsight but will probably just use the bolts from now on. At most sport crags, I think this would probably get an R rating as well as three stars. I wouldn't be too psyched to use only the dead tree as a belay anchor, this route is pretty good at spitting people off. I used some nuts, a #2 Camalot and a long sling to make a solid anchor at the walk off ledge.

    Ditto, Roger (on both accounts) - I was climbing up in the Estes Park area this past weekend and a fall on some of the bolted climbs would have been dramatic to say the least: Index toe before the last bolt comes to mind - there is the potential for 50'er (easy rock but uneasy climbing).  Some bolted routes are not for the squeemish....
    May 29, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Here's what I think about sport/trad with bolts.  In my opinion, part of the definition of a sport route is that it is well protected enough that there is no potential for long falls or dangerous ones anyway.  So if you go by that, routes like Pansee Sauvage or maybe Just Another Girls Climb, or any pitch with an "S" rating, wouldn't be classified as sport routes even though bolts are the only pro. Sunset Boulevard is definitely a sport route.
    May 29, 2002

    I agree this is a good route. I also agree that this route is probably not .11c. It also poses a question- Is a route that is lead using only bolts for pro a sport route? This one is not over bolted, but the cruxes are well protected. Hmmm....

    It doesn't deserve the star that it get's in the new Eldo Guide.  To start the second pitch go directly up the bulge just left of where the first pitch comes up and traverse under the pigeon shit to a very licheny corner.  Go up the corner to a ledge and up an obvious but not pretty groove.  It's probably better to rappel than to try to find the walk-off.

    Very fun classic route. Steep climbing on jugs. Easy access and 3 pitches to the summit. What else can you ask for?     The cruxes have adequate pro and clear fall lines. Some of the moves are spooky and exposed but not to warrant an S IMHO.     The crux for me was about 30 feet after the start as you pull onto the arrette. My advice--just let go of the bomber undercling and trust the smaller holds above. Its over in a minute then its fun heucos to a fun chimmney.
    May 19, 2009

    We did the route about a week ago. I took P2. The first pitch starts just up the trail from Hair City and immediately traverses left. You can get a very shallow small cam on the far left before you go up. P2 has you just under an overhang with a crack running up the right side. There's a doughnut hole of rock you can sling if you like, but it's fractured. A cam to the left would be better. I climbed up to inspect the thin roof crack in the back of the overhang and decided what kind of piece I wanted, stepped down to the big ledge and got it ready, and then went up the crack. Pretty exciting! The rest of the pitch is very straight forward and broken up with rest ledges. Consider doing this route if you are looking for something at the grade and the other routes on the Bastille are occupied. Much easier than "Breakfast in Bed" a few lines over.

    Yet another finish to this route face climbs out from the belay alcove (before the chimney) to the right on good holds, but runout (5.5), to join the West Chimney route.  This finish is rated 5.7 but feels more like 5.8 to me.  This second pitch can be done in one long pitch.  A great link-up.    Rossiter calls this 5.8+S so I was reluctant to get on it for a while.  It didn't feel too runout to me; just take advantage of placement opportunities.

    Good stuff.  The first 30 feet or so has the crux and only takes a small wire and alien or similar for pro, and it is SLIPPERY.  Once you are through the slippery stuff, the climbing is steep, juggy and really fun.  Combined with the 5.7 finish to the West Buttress, it is a great outing.

    The first pitch has a few steep and stylin' moves.  Even the second pitch is not too bad.  However, be carefull of a few fragile features under the roof at the first belay.

For the direct start: do not traverse left from the start of Hair City, rather drop down the hill a tier to start, and climb directly up to the bolt in the steep, vertical-to-almost-overhanging face. Once past this section, you join the regular route above the regular start's traverse.    Pro beta: there are a couple good cam placements before the bolt in the 0.5-1 C4 range. A tricam also fits one of the placements.    Crux beta: the reach past the bolt is difficult if you don't know where the hold is. It's a hard pull to explore for that hold, and the clock is ticking. Otherwise, if you nail that hold right away, it's a reasonable 5.10 move.    There are good nut placements after you clear the difficulty and get a stance before the pins.

    I typically want my hair on fire all the way to the top, so I climb the last pitch of Hair City. This way makes a real hum dinger of a 5.9 rock climb to the top of the mighty, mighty Bastille.

    A fine climb with exposure and fun (even the OW) movement throughout.    The 5.7 version of P3 isn't getting much love, for some reason. I found it to be enjoyable climbing on big jugs and incuts. If you want your hair to be on fire all the way to the top...well, the 5.7 isn't for you...but it's a nice finish after groveling your way up the OW.

    Fantastic climb!  I seconded up the variation on the Super Start (10a), and we inadvertently climbed the second pitch of Hair City from the anchors above the second pitch of the West Buttress.      If you want a sustained 5.9 climb the whole way up, I highly recommend the second pitch of Hair City instead of the rest of West Buttress for a hair-raising, exposed, but extremely enjoyable and safe roof!

    I'm not a wide crack fan, so while leading the second pitch, I clipped the bolt and busted out right to the arete and then up to the belay ledge. 5.9ish and some decent gear once you get out there and up.  Recommended.  Also, I back cleaned my gear so my partner could climb the wide crack. Also recommended. :-)

    I thought the "5.10" variation was easy.  I struggled figuring out the crux sequence but got the onsight, then started to go left and got scared.  So decided to take the crack, if you go left first it is not that hard to get into the crack and is definitely easier than the crux.  Also it takes great gear if your a big baby like me.

    Hmm. Seems there's lots of beta about options after the crux, but nothing about nailing that reach. So...EXCESSIVE BETA WARNING: After the traverse, clip the pins, position your feet up on the little ledge, and select a higher edge for your right foot to press a semi-lieback. Decide which right pull crimps in the crack to crank on, imagine powering the move and throwing your left hand up to the holds above the crack, and it feels HARD! Hard crank, hard balance, hard everything. If you do it like the guy in the "5.9 crux reach" photo, more power to you. I was a wimp, felt sure I'd fall, and couldn't force myself to commit to a move that felt futile. ("There's a pin at your chest, weenie! Go for it!" *wimper*)     I backed off and Rowdy Ranger Mike McHugh polished it off. Then, on second, a miracle happened. Same awkward stance, same high right foot, same low right pull crimp...and then...instead of cranking a big move and throwing left hand up, I started to pull a slower, little move, my left hand still on something lower, maybe flat on the face for balance, don't really remember, but the miracle: just before my left foot pulled off the flattish ledge, I suddenly thought to look DOWN and left, where I spied a greasy scoop to pop my left foot up on. Foot held fine. I was higher without any uber crank on the crack crimps. Suddenly, all the holds that had been a foot or more out of range were in easy reach.     Now, your left hand moves casually up, feels selectively around for the best hold, and you've done the crux reach. Easy. Where to go after that? Straight? Little left? Big left? Your call. Read the other comments for that beta.    By the way, this isn't just cheap top rope advice: after I joined him at the belay, Maestro Mike mentored on: "Shall we finish, or do you want to go back and lead it clean?" That's what we did. Thanks, Mike.

    An exciting and varied route - highly recommended if you are comfortable at the grade.  The opening traverse is a bit polished, adding to the excitement.  I though the crux seemed fair at 5.9+, but I knew exactly how to do it from the MP beta, so that certainly made it easier. The pins were in good shape on 5/16/2009.  Above the pin the climbing is easier, but don't expect much gear.    I thought P2 was really fun.  I clipped the bolt, and cranked into the offwidth.  Good fun, but I enjoy a little squeeze now-and-then... particularly with a bolt :)    I opted for the left P3 finish, and thought it was a dud.  I won't be repeating that finish again.  Easy to take this pitch all the way to the top.

    8/9/07 was a fun send. Cops blocked off the road to Eldo for a race- ran for 20min. w/ light rack + rope. Oh and a case of PBRs- which we deposited @ Kev's and Bodey's place. Started climbing @ ? 8:45pm.  Rack I lead on 1st pitch in order: -Pin; -Pin; -#5 RP (BD); skipped bolt anchor- did clip inset piton-w/ double length runner. After a pigeon flew out the crack right in my face. - Bolt; to the 2 bolt anchor belay.  Now it's dark.       2nd pitch: -piton @ 5.7 move, 5 pigeons chillin' right w/ that pin, had a quick chat w/ them and decided to back pin up w/ that #5 RP I used earlier in case birds freak out. Top out. Done dark style.

    What a great way to finish off the day.  We did the crack that continues straight up past the pins through the thin crack.  Never even realized that the route went left at the second pin.  It did feel harder than 9+ so it makes sense.  The squeeze chimney was a little intense... they aren't my favorite.  The simple top out pitch was cool, too.
    Sep 26, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This is a superb climb, and IMHO one of the finest 9s in Eldo. If you need exposure fast, this is the route for you. Two moves off the trail, and you have much exposure. Combining P1 and P2 makes for one hell of a good pitch with a little bit of everything. I am 5'8" and felt the crux at the second pin on P1 to be quite tricky, the off-width section was wild. I'm a fan of OWs, so I went for it using off-width technique, which did not last long before I figured out that there is a little trick to keep everything at 5.9-. I think that if you go with pure OW on this section, you will get a little more than 5.9.

    After 4 times on the route, I still think the P1 crux is one of the hardest in Eldo!  Delicate feet.  Anyway, my point is really that, on P3, there are 3 ways to go, right after the rotten band.  Far left is the funky 5.7 thing, to the far right is a loose committing 5.8+ (as was already mentioned), but I recommend the middle option: straight up the middle crack above you.  5.9.  A great stopper placement right before the moves over the top should give some encouragement...after tiptoeing through that rotten, crappy red band.  (NOTE--There are a couple of VERY loose blocks in that but, then again, this IS Eldo, God love her!).  Have fun!

    Instead of traversing left at the second piton I went straight up the crack(following chalk marks) and onto the face(5.10). Stout and pumpy, yet fun and a bit heady. The gear is there, but one must be a little creative in placing it. Crimp/layback the flake on the second pitch, chicken wing the chimney.     Traversing left at the piton is a bit confusing, hence the crack above. Well worth doing.

    Another way to do the start of the 10a direct: Right foot to a small put positive hold up and left from the pin. Right hand to a good sidepull in the crack, just above the brass nut/small stopper you should have placed. Left foot up to big hold. Rock ontol left foot. You can climb much higher on this variation than the beta photo indicates before escaping left to join the regular route. Where you escape left depends on how far you are willing to run it out on 5.8 or so climbing.
    Sep 27, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Agree with Jay and Charles regarding the step left at the beginning of the (10a) variation on P1.  I used it, as it offered more leverage for the crank up and thru. Easier (10a) move though than say...the crux of Blind Faith.  IMO this climb favors those high on the ape index, especially at that move, as well as the one down below in the lower crack.The (9) move at the bolt on P2 into the chimney is pretty wild...I stepped high with the left foot and layed that bitch back. Not a gimme layback either...kinda flared out and down sloping rock, so I stemmed way out with the right foot, and then shifted my left side &amp; inserted the left leg in the off-width.  One of the weirdest moves I've done in awhile. Once in the OW, work over to a nice chockstone &amp; shimmey up 8' to the belay ledge. Hellova fun climb...lots of variety.

    Beta on the 5.10 variation:    There are two ways that I know of to get into the the crack above the tricky 5.9 crux.    1) (hard way) grab those huge juggs to the right after the 5.9 crux, work your feet up in the thin seem---lock off, and grab a really shitty hold in the crack. you now have really shitty hands and no feet to get the rest position.    2) (easier, less obvious way) instead of grabing the juggs to the right, step left a foot or two (or three??) and balance your way up to the crack with better feet.

    The crux is harder than anything on Hair City.  The offwidth on the second pitch is quite a wake-up call too, when you realize you can't remember how to climb OW's any more.  Liebacking past it may be the easiest way, but is this cheating?
    Oct 7, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I climbed this on 7/4 and both pins are still at the crux on the first pitch. An old ring pin is at the end of the hand traverse (about a foot above the holds in the start of the crack ) and the other one is a LA at your waist for the crux move. it is easy to place a back-up piece near the first pin. You do not need much gear for any of the pitches and emphasize on smaller stuff. Also a #4 cam is nice before you clip the bolt on the OW pitch.casey bernal
    Jul 8, 2002

    after the traverse after the crux be prepared to get creative with gear (i placed nothing bigger than a red alien on the first pitch)....anyways the climbing is easy but the path of least resistance does require thought, as the easiest way wanders a bit
    Jun 23, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    There's also a variation to the second pitch that is pretty fun. Climb up, clip the bolt and traverse on thin holds out right to the arete (awkward/a little airy/scary) then climb up the face. It's about .8+, so it's a bit easier than the normal route. It's also a little more interesting. Quick note on the pins on the first pitch. One of them is missing as of this fall. I think it was the lower one but I could be wrong. It is possible to back up the pin with gear however.
    Feb 4, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Another great variation for the 3rd pitch is to take the right side roof, which is actually West Face route. I thought is was the better one of the three choices, all of which end up in the same place. But a word of warning, just when you start up into the roof, theres a horn sticking out that is a must to make the move... it EXTREMELY lose and sounds like its about to snap. Other then that, its an awesome pitch!

    Escalar - Going straight up after the initial crux makes for an even better pitch.  It might be .10a/b or so.  It is well protected--better protected than going off to the left.  It is also nice to do the "direct start", starting under the initial traverse at the bolt.  It is not as hard as it looks especially if you are tall, but it does involve a long reach--solid 5.10.  Combining these variations makes a superb, direct line up a beautiful wall.

    Updated the "beta photo". Reading the description and comments here, I was pretty confused about the variations when I went to lead this a few days ago.     "The 5.10 section", "the 5.11 start", "the 5.10a bulge", "getting on the slab (5.10a/b)", "the 10c way", "the 11a/b way", "the 11b variation", "direct start via thin crack (5.10c/d)", "the 11b straight up variation", "the 10a/b bulge"....    After getting on it:    -Direct start: just right of the start to Hair City, climb the thin crack straight up from the lowest point just right of Hair City. (I found this solid 5.10-5.10+. Levin calls it 5.11a.) There was a fixed nut on this crack.    -Indirect start begins further right and traverses left onto the ledge above the direct start crack. (Silly, I think, the direct is totally worthwhile).    -Then climb cracks to the bulge. Decision time:    -Keep right through the bulge at 5.11a (or b or whatever)    -Or step left 5.10a (or b or whatever). Here you can go left right away to a bolt to bail onto Hair City or back right to continue up West Face.     There is good pro up to that decision point, then hard to place through the crux, but there are a couple very good placements. Also a pretty clean fall if needed (I did).    There is a lot of climbing in this short bit via the direct start through the bulge!    Edit July 2016, worked on the direct variation staying in the crack today, not moving left... kind of a greasy feeling day on all routes today. Felt 5.11b in my book.
    Jun 17, 2015

    Climbed the first pitch today.  After the 10a/b bulge, I stayed climber's right and found fairly easy climbing with descent gear.  Set up a below behind the big pillar next to a fixed pin.  Since we didn't find any bolts, we left a nut to back up the pin and rapped from there to the ground.
    Oct 20, 2014
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Awesome route that is entertaining the whole way.  That bent over pin at the bulge crux is suspect as it's probably had multiple whippers on it and is deserving of being backed up.  The 11b straight up variation exceeded my leading mojo, but moving left was way fun.
    Aug 9, 2013
</blockquote><blockquote>
    West Face Double Direct, 5.11a PG.     Take direct start via thin crack (5.10c/d) to a stance. Climb dual cracks to the bulge (pin, small gear) and instead of stepping left, continue up and slightly right. Another crux is encountered at the pin which can be backed up with a 1" cam. Great moves on good holds. Continue 25 more feet to a stance.    I didn't find a bolted anchor where Levin indicates. I didn't continue up so was forced to rap off two stoppers. They are yours, or leave them for others. Excellent route!

Did the start clean even after plugging up the good finger lock with a yellow Alien but, got worked on the bulge!!

    I thoroughly enjoyed this route.  Classic Eldo style in running 'er out on smaller gear.  There is a tricky blue TCU placement from a steep stance right below a broken knifeblade that enabled me to proceed through the crux, with a little caution.

    My [friends] and I have been on this pitch at least  three different times.  It is a great climb.  The 10c way is fun, but the 11a/b way is much better.  For us the moves are beta intensive. At first it felt much harder than 11, but after working (read TR) it into submision it still is very hard for us, but we can do it on TR.  John did manage to get it with one hang at the crux pin.  The pin has held us on [several] falls and you can back it up with a good cam a foot below.  The problem is that we cannot put in any more pro until we a standing on the small sloping ledge four feet above the pin.  That puts fear in me.  We finish by going [straight] up above two more pins and staying just left of the chimney.  I also agree that the 5.11a start is very easy for its grade. Very nice moves.
    Aug 11, 2005

    I followed the West Face first pitch and struggled at the bulge. The 5.11 start was difficult, however, I had a harder time getting around the 5.10a bulge, getting onto the slab (5.10a/b), then moving right. Good, balancy moves over good air made this pitch exciting.

    I did it on Saturday with my girlfriend, who is short, small fingered, and very strong (X-gymnast). Here's what it boils down to- I though it was incredibly easy at the grade, she thought it was very hard (she has done other 11's). We dissected what occurred when we returned to the base. As usual, it's all about sequence- one move ...if you get it right. Not to sandbag or downplay that Steve can climb circles around me, but I don't think the edges are marginal at all- if your feet are in the right place (not the big holds) then the hands you use are all pretty positive, and I did it in the direct sun in the afternoon.  Then I went and felt desperate on Supremacy Crack...

    It's possible to avoid crossing over to Hair City by staying right above the last pin at the 5.10 section and climbing up to the chimney on the right side of the giant flake (5.7s).

    This is an interesting route with extremely varied climbing and none of the bird droppings mentioned above. Start of the first pitch is 50 feet of 5.5-6 crack that protects well. The traverse left is on questionable rock, but there are many opportunities for protecting with small stoppers. Best to traverse left on this pitch until you see the not-easy-to-see piton, and climb up from there. The 20 feet of offwidth on the next pitch is 5.5, but unless you bring a #9 Valley Giant or a #3 Bigbro, it’s not protectable. #5-6 Camalots don’t really do the job. To locate the traverse to the right, climb up the crack, which is past the offwidth, until it really steepens and see an old piton on the traverse to the right. The traverse is fun with gaping exposure. There are two pitons on the traverse, but the second is bent, and I was unable to clip it Petzl Star carabiner. The traverse ends in a cave on Blind Faith. Best to belay from there and not run out the pitch—for obvious reasons: communication with the second and rope drag.

    Echoing the comments of some others:     Not really difficult climbing and not a bad route (overall), but P1's 30 feet of traversing on broken, movable rock over not-so-great pro detracts from the fun of this one. There were plenty of jutting flakes with Xs on them today and plenty more that moved when touched that should have had Xs.... P2 is considerably more entertaining.

    Had a surprisingly really fun time on this climb. The 5.6 rotten traverse was exciting with a mediocre cam 20' below, but if you are patient and seek out good rock, it is (kind of) there. I thought it was exciting.    Otherwise, the fat crack was fun, and the 5.8 corner w/ perfect hand jams and a sweet move around the corner was great. Recommend doing if you can overcome the scary rock on the first pitch.

    Followed this today and saw not a single pigeon or a drop of bird poop, which was odd considering the ever-present swallows. (Have swallows replaced the pigeons?)

    Really fun route overall, much better than the above description makes it out to be. Definitely do the 5.8 variation on P2!

Great exposure and variation, you just need a little sense of adventure!

    ~200' of a route, with 50' of good climbing (5.5), then 30' of terrible climbing (5.6+), then 120' of good climbing again (with the 5.8 variation). A #6 protects the offwidth at the start of pitch 2 pretty well (about 5.5), though you'd need something bigger to have a perma-top-rope. For the 30' of terrible climbing, here's a hint: the lower route is better rock overall, but only slightly. Not a great lead for tentative or learning leaders.

    Don't know why people are bagging on this route. Sure, there's bird crap from time to time, but isn't that just part of the Eldo Experience? I think it's a great route for someone who is not climbing 5.10 crack but is comfortable with the run-out, loose nature of the red band as you find on P1. It's a nice summit route, and the lower and upper portions (aka Blind Faith) are really fun and protect well.

    +1 for birds flying in my face. I stood up in the crack on the second pitch and birds were right in front of me. I held on tightly while they ran into me and the wall for probably 10 seconds before they found their way out. Poor birds! While there were a few fun moves on this route, the combination of the terrifying choss at the end of the first pitch, the run out at the beginning of the second pitch, and the birds flying into me, made this a route I don't recommend.      I stayed left, and climbed the 5.8 crack on the second pitch, out of fear of encountering more choss (I could see that the 5.8 had good gear). I'd recommend staying left, because the moves were fun and well protected.

    Climbed this Sat.  Definitely a decent route, great exposure, and quality rock except for the traverse.  There is a good fixed pin on the traverse if you go far enough.  At least twice I was tempted to go straight up to the ledge, but my gear was iffy and so was the rock, so I continued traversing and found a good pin.    P2 was more exciting as we did not follow the route description very well.  After the OW we continued straight up (no traverse) following the crack system.  It steepens, then you must move around right and up to stay in the crack system.  You automatically merge with Blind Faith/West Chimney after that.  The gear is good and the rock is excellent.  Felt like 8+ or 9 for a few moves.

    There is some very good climbing in the initial right angling crack (though I thought pretty stout in places for 5.5). Not for the beginning 5.5 leader. However, I would not repeat this climb because for me the traverse left on pitch one and the moves up to the belay are just too dangerous for my liking. All those flakes jutting out look so tempting to grab but I was fearful the whole way that at any time the holds would come off. (A few even moved when I started to weight them). Anyways, it is an adventure and gives you great views and expose, just be super careful. If you do climb it I would also suggest a couple of extra pieces in the 1-2 cam size range.

    Oh man.  That traverse under the gnarly-looking, right-facing dihedral on P1  was horrendous.  I didn't trust any of my gear placements and I was fearful that my hand holds would simply pop off.  Aiding up Blind Faith probably would have been safer than this crappy traverse.    As far as the off-width,  I didn't bother with it.  The face climbing to the right was much easier.  Unfortunately, the biggest cam I had was a number 3, and that went in right below the crack.  The rest I ran out.  In fact, I only managed to get in two pieces from the diversion of the route from Blind Faith to the top of the off width.  Spicy.

    Just climbed this route for the first time today, with a group of three even. First of all, it is a much less secure 5.7 than the Bastille Crack. The traverse after the first part of Blind Faith leads you to one of the many angled rock layers. This traverse has rather crappy gear, but if you stay low until it nearly intersects the upper crack/ramp, you are rewarded with a fairly new piton near your feet. Climb straight up from there and get a small cam in a crack through the rotten, red rock. If you were lucky enough to still have some cams in the #2-#3 [Camalot] range, you can build an anchor on this larger part of the ledge. If not, you can traverse right to a smaller crack that eats nuts and small cams.     I had nothing that would fit the offwidth above, so I opted for the deeply inserted left leg style of climbing this section. Your second will enjoy staying out of the offwidth and instead stepping on dainty footholds on the slab. After the offwidth, there is a large boulder perched at the top of the crack. I went around right andplaced my first piece of P2 in a crack behind it. Go up above into the continuing crack about 20ft where good gear awaits. At the traverse right, you will see a ring piton that is easily clipped before committing to the traverse. A second piton can also be clipped while into he traverse. Rope drag for me was insane up above this, so be careful of that. You'll come to a small cave above the traverse. Instead of going straight up out of the cave, look around to the face out and left and see a nice spot for a mid size cam. The rest of the climb tapers off in difficulty and route finding tasks. No birds nesting.            -Tim Stich

    I've done this one twice. It is good in parts, however both times that I've been on this there has been a ton of bird poop and birds. All of the doo doo is concentrated at the second pitch crux. The smell up there was so foul that I did not want to stop to place pro. Plus the last time I climbed it I thought that I was going to be attacked by the two pigeons that flew out of their perch right when my face was even with them. Other than that, the climb is good.

    That's an impressive "first-lead-ever" and not really one that I'd recommend as such. One thing worth mentioning is that the 2nd pitch is a good alternative to the 2nd pitch of Blind Faith (up &amp; left from the belay and joining it just above the OW).  As P2 of Blind Faith is a bit dodgey at dusk, there is no fixed rap anchors atop P1, and they didn't know about the West Chimney, Beth chose the dubious descent route toward the right.
    Aug 13, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree that this climb is much better than the description suggests.  P1 is a good warm up with steep climbing on big holds, mildly runout.  P2 offers a fun, easy OW, a steep corner, a delicate step around move, and a fun chimney finish.  It also pretty much rounds out the difficulty gamut for Bastille climbing.  Worth doing!
    Aug 13, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I did this climb as my first on-sight lead last night. I think Richard Rossiter's guidebook understates how far left and up you need to traverse on the first pitch. There is a little green shrub at the base of the "right-leaning, right-facing dihedral with a wide crack" that can be easily spotted from the ground. Look for that to get an idea of how far left and up you need to go before you start. The crux was excellent and had a couple of very "balancy" moves on it - nothing extraordinarily difficult, but great fun with a lot of air beneath you. IMHO, I think Chris has done this route a disservice with his evaluation above. While it certainly has a lot of pigeon shit on it (and pigeons that can scare the shit of you as they fly out of their roost) in a couple of spots, the route has some excellent features:  + Off width crack that is good for beginners  + Varied moves - balancing, traversing, chimney (second pitch), layback.  All in all, I think this route should be upgraded to two stars. I am definitely going back.
    Aug 13, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    One more thought on this route:  it's got clean crack climbing, a funky loose rock traverse (P1), an easy roof (again P1, but maybe we were a bit off route), an off width, and an airy traverse.  I thought it was different and well worth it.  And except for the OW, I thought the pro was all there.
    Aug 5, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Doing this route yesterday, my partner and I gave the first pitch a 5.5++, and the finishing pitch a 5.7++ (rather than the 5.5, 5.7 of the guidebook).  I wish I'd read George's comments to bring big gear--leading out for pitch two and finding my #4 Camalot not up to the task made me glad this was not one of my first outings of the year.  Other than being, IMHO, a sandbag, this was a very fun and varied route.

    Check out Pete's account of this accident on  members.aol.com/ptakeda1/wr… He does not give details on exactly where they were.  This is just the easiest route on this face and I was assuming they were downclimbing it, but I don't really know.
    Feb 12, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    If I'm not mistaken, the aforementioned party did not attempt to downclimb West Chimney, but had climbed P1 of Blind Faith and from the belay ledge opted to traverse unroped right and off on the downsloping rotten band/ledge.  There is one lower 5th class move with 30-40 feet of exposure on this downclimb, and the rock is poor.

    I remember this route being better than Chris indicates.  It also contains (on pitch 2) one of the few "easy offwidth" cracks around.  If you are leading at your limit, you might need some big gear to protect this well.    On a historical note, I believe it was this route that was downclimbed (in error) by Beth Coates and Pete Takeda.  Beth fell and is now paralyzed from the waist down.  Be careful!

    Just went up this route yesterday-- terrific! Holds feel a bit creaky, but nothing came out on me.     Side note-- the last bolt before the anchors looks quite loose, probably due to more than a few whippers. Could use a little love next time someone is up there.

    May 24, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Careful up there.  The larger of the two holds by the 5th bolt is crunching and creeking so loud that your belayer can hear it.  I had my doubts- I tried to work the crimper next to it and couldn't pull the move that way.  Eventually, I got pumped and yarded on it anyway.  It did hold me, but I would approach it with caution, if I tried again.    I think it is also the 5th bolt that is almost shattered out as well.  There is no danger of hitting the ground if it were to pull, but you might get slapped in the head with a chunk of rock.
    Aug 13, 2002

    For full entertainment value, after sending the route lower off and down-clean the draws- at the lowest bolt have your belayer give you a touch of slack and then let go...good training for Elitch's Amusement Park.    PS The perfect place to be for late afternoon sun.

    Agree with the others: a clear 1 1/2 move wonder. However, still worth doing if you're in the area since the rest of the climb is pleasant if easy. Fell at the crux leading it a few years back -- redeemed myself yesterday. An excellent start/warmup for Stargate.

    Did this today while waiting for Moonlight Drive to open up and found it to be a worthwhile route. As stated above, the route is definitely a one or two move wonder.

    Oct 16, 2005

    This climb is a lot better if you take the variation called Auburn Court, which adds about 35 feet of quality crack climbing and a second crux (and avoids the rubble at the top). We should have listed it as a variation here, but it's posted as a separate route on this site.
    Jun 9, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I thought this was an okay route. Crux is extremely brief (maybe one move) I could not tell any difference in rating between the first and second pitches. The top of the route is loose rock hell for anyone not being extremely careful.    I did both Morning Thunder and Over the Hill in the last couple of weeks and think both of those routes are harder than this. IMHO if it is even a 5.10, it would barely make 5.10a and only for one very brief move.
    Jun 8, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Slightly chossy in places, with a very brief crux.  Seems like a 10d move, though it's over quickly.  Second pitch would be nice with a little traffic to clean it.  The belay area at the top is loaded with precarious rocks ready to fall down into the dihedral - caution or hats advised, and I would steer well clear if another party is up there.      Not the worst route in the world, but if you're at Cadillac and craving some 5.10 crack... you walked just a bit too far up the hill.

    Great route! Similar in style, difficulty, quality, and excitement to Aerospace. I don't think it deserves an "R" rating, although a fall getting to the third bolt could suck (you wouldn't deck, but the slabby arete below could make things awkward). The gear between the 2nd and 3rd bolt is bomber, I used a purple Camalot.  I did the whole thing as one pitch, up to the bolts atop the fin, which was great.

    I got on this route yesterday (9/6/02) and found it to be an Eldorado gem.  It has masterful slab climbing with a stunning postion.  Though the crux is runout that only made it better.

    I left a wire draw on the third bolt last weekend, but it still seems run out to me now.  I guess 16 years and 30 pounds does make a difference.  I used a large stopper in the crack between the 2nd and 3rd bolts which looked pretty solid.  I'd have no objection if someone wanted to add a bolt.

    Hi Ben,  Yeah- BUSTED on my part.  Just goes to show that you can climb a route a few times and come back with different opinions.  The comments were written in 2001/2002.  Since that time I've redone the route and adjusted my own opinion and added a 'grade' to the route of 10a.  As you may know, the grade rating for routes feature was not even available in 2001/2002 on MP.com...  Anyway, it's a great illustration of how subjective grades are, even to a single person.  Perhaps Jay's comment immediately above is the best rating explanation available anyway.  "5.9+"  Rather that realign things here, I will leave them as is for exactly that reason/illustration.  Have a good one out there and be safe!

    Maybe I was having a good day, but it felt 5.9 and way easier than I had anticipated.  I am not one to downgrade routes normally.  Most Eldo 9's feel difficult! I went with the traditional 9+ rating because I don't want anyone to feel sandbagged.
    May 28, 2011

    Ahh, Eldo 5.9+.  I love this:       Tony Bubb rates it 5.10a after saying "... honest at its grade..." and "..hard end of 5.9, but still .9 in my opinion..."    AND       Jay Eggleston rates it 5.9+ while saying "... one of the easier 9s in Eldo...."    And the funniest part?  I agree!! (since 5.9+ is often harder than 5.10a).

I even took my first lead fall on this one---SAVED by a red Alien---!!  The route is very easy to protect and a beautifull straight forward line which is why i chose it as my first 9. Stoppers and small cams are the way to go here I think I placed a 1.5 camalot right before I popped off near the middle but that was the biggest one I plugged.  Led V3 after this and felt like I was in "easy heaven"!!!

    Sirens of Titan is softer than a feather pillow, so it's not very fair to use that as a comparison, or almost all of the Eldo 5.9s are 5.10s...  It's harder than The Bat and Auburn Lane as well, but that doesn't make it 5.11...those are just super-soft routes (at 5.10d?!??!)    Touch and Go, The Green Spur, P1 of Yellow Spur, C'est La vie, P1 of Tagger, , etc... those are the yardstick 5.9s in my book, and to what I would compare Deviant.  It is tough, and on the hard end of 5.9, but still .9 in my opinion.  YMMV.-Tony Bubb

    Tough for the grade.  I found it to be harder than a number of the classic low 10s in the Canyon, and it is miles beyond what should be a comparable route: the 5.9 leaning crack just right of Prince of Darness (called Sirens of Titan, I think).  Good fun, but the leaning position and uneven nature of the crack make it a real challenge.

    I found the route honest at its grade.  Nice rock, nice moves, nice setting.  If it were a multi-pitch it would qulify for classic status.      My partner lead it and found it difficult to plac the protection due to the right-hand overlap of the crack combined with the fact that it leans left.  This may be why stoppers are good, but hard to place without a pump.  A 1" cam is the crux pro- one of my cams now has a broken cross bar to prove it (Thanks, Mark).

    As Michael suggests, combining this with Ghetto Cruiser makes for an enjoyable 160' linkup.  I was able to keep the ropedrag to a tolerable level using a double length sling on the traverse (which protects well with a blue TCU).  The anchor bolts look okay, but the bolt hangers and sun-bleached tat is in bad shape (9/03).  A good service project to the climbing community would be to replace these with 1/2" stainless hangers and eliminate the webbing rat's nest/eyesore.    An alternative to the double-rope rap mentioned is 2 single rope raps. First one takes you to a large tree in between Fins 1 and 2 (the first belay for Ichiban Arete). Second one gets you to the ground.

    A very good climb that needed a little more cleaning.  I inadvertently gave it just that. A handhold snapped and in the course of trying to recover my balance, I sheared off a delicate foothold &amp; took a pretty good fall.  Joseffa broke a loose one off following, too.  The resulting edges are better than the originals, and this was well below the crux, so the grade was not effected.   The worst pro on the route is a "good" #1 RP next to a blue Alien in a so-so horizontal. This protects against what might otherwise be a long and dangerous fall from the crux.  Then a 1.5-2" cam may be placed in the middle of the crux, which I actually found to be a bit powerful, but on good enough holds so as to be easier than the climbing down lower where the less comforting gear was.  After pulling the last roof/bulge (big moves on good holds) you get run-out quite a bit unless you take a #4 Camalot for behind the big flake up top.  Beware that if you climb the flake on the outside (lie-back style) that the top right section of it is detached, so don't pull too had unless you want to take a big fall.  Past the flake you can run it clear to the top for a nearly 200' single pitch.    One of the best things about it is its 'improbability' as the book puts it.  The climb keeps looking like it will get very hard or impossible, but at each critical juncture gives you just enough of something to keep it 5.10.      Overall, the route was modestly rated for quality by the FA party. It is fun moves on interesting rock and deserves at least 3 stars.

    This route is a nice warm up to start your day. It faces southeast and is one of the first lines on Cadillac to get sun. Sling gear long at the top of the corner, so you can traverse on to Easy Street and the bolt anchors.

    Fun, fun, fun! One of my new favorites at the grade in Eldo. Good gear and a few tricky moves kept me thinking all the way. The short runout at the bulge where the crack ends briefly gave me some pause, but it's all there once you get moving. The steep roof was a hoot and is protected well by a #3 BD.    As others have stated, rapping off seems more of a cluster than it's worth IMO. Just use the obvious walkoff.

    Probably best to double rope rappel from the anchors, but I think you would be ok rapping from the back if you make sure to throw the cord over the top towards the backside.

    Surprisingly fun route.  Not sure where you'd place the number 4.  It is too small for all but the first few feet of the offwidth.  More pleasant climbing is had in the dihedral to the left of the OW.  Belaying just before heading up and left on the Easy Street ramp will prevent considerable rope drag and provide some shelter from gale force winter winds.      The anchors are not well thought out.  The two options are extending the anchors with long slings to lower to the bolts on the top of Untitled/Ichiban Arete and rapping from there or rap off the back and hike around.

I concur with Kevin that I did not love the cord directly through the old-ish bolt/hangars as the profile on the hangars is very thin and 'sharp'. Couple quicklinks would do it (I woulda, but didn't have 'em).
    Oct 1, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The old bolts and hangers are still there.  Because of where the bolts have been placed it requires good rope management and serious muscle to pull your rope.  We rapped into the gully to the west and at the big tree/2nd rap station there was only a single sling with a leaver biner on it.  At this date the sling is in good shape.  The cord being used at the top is another matter.  It is tied well but was pretty toasty.  Being it is directly threaded through the old stamped hangers it is time to replace it.  Just a couple of screw links through the hangers would help this anchor/rap station.  To make this a well-oiled 2 raps to the ground you might consider: four small, screw links, 25' feet of 1" tube you can cut up and a couple of rap rings.  The four links (or two links and two rap rings) and 10'(? maybe a little extra just in case) of the webbing for the top and the rings and the rest of the webbing at the big tree.  Great pitch.  But the rap, at least the way we did it, was as not good.

    Did this route on [Thursday] and really wasn't expecting anything since its rated 5.7.  This route felt more 5.8 to me near the top.  But, I stayed in the dihedral the whole way.  The gear placement is good and the route gets nice and steep.  The moves felt quite commiting near the top!  I think this route gets by with two stars.

    We really wanted to climb V3 on Fin 4, but that was already taken. Rossiter doesn't give Ghetto Cruiser a star rating so I wasn't expecting much. But, this is a fun climb. I agree that it's an old school 5.7 rating. Getting up the steep slot is a little strenous with a committing move, but it's fun and the pro is there. I used a small pebble on the left wall to make that last move into the slot. We didn't continue up Easy Street, but scrambled back down to the base instead to see if V3 was available.

    combined with easy street this is a great route, the summit is worth the sections of hollow flakes.  the rap bolts are solid, the hangers are old homemade jobs, but they seem safe.  pretty adventurey, lichen, chong-a-bong flakes and exposure near the top combine to give this a microneering feel.  and yes, some of us like that over waiting in lines to climb classics......oh and the views are grand.

    Just wanted to mention that the rappel anchors on the top are quite the museum pieces.  If you're concerned, bring about 10-15 ft of webbing to tie around a horn on the summit to back them up.  I've got an application in to replace them and it should be done by, say, December.  Definitely string together Ghetto and Easy.  Good times!

    This route is memorable and old school 5.7. If the face to the left of the huge crack is taken, continuing the sunstained nature of the dihedral, an exciting route is had. the moves are [strenuous] and rewarding. Don't bear right to a tree but charge straight up to a slot. Above the slot is the ramp leading to Easy street and the summit. Finish with Easy Street for a two star route. A fine autumn climb with a SW orientation. The route description is kind of ambiguous, so here's the take on my line:  start from a ledge above the talus slope on the SW face of Fin 1, above and to the right from the bottom of the colorful face.  Traverse to the left toward the huge roof on an easy strata.  A [right] facing corner shoots up  before reaching the arete after about 15 feet.  The start has dual cracks (the one on the right takes good gear) and the fun is stemming b/w these two...yippee...to a nice stance.  Contemplate your future, your objective is the large slot between overhanging roof sections.  You can work right and be below a wide fist crack that goes up to the right small roof and then work left under the roof to the large slot; or (recommended) continue straight up the corner, placing great gear in the crack before it ends.  Place it well from your good stance because you will be forced out onto the face to work around the bulge and you might get pumped trying to place marginal gear when the crack resumes.  This section is not for the meek.  Your next rest and good gear is a stance and hand jam under the slot.  Continue up the large slot, which is easy.

    Both pitches are great. Great stances and moves on the first and excellent jamming and crack work on the second. Leading the second pitch I had 4 #3s, 2 #2s, and a #4 and was able to sew it right up. I thought the whole crack was very secure, because you can always get a right foot.

    2nd pitch is quite wide.  Didn't have anything bigger than a single #2 Camalot.  the jams were secure enough, but it was run out.  Bring at least 2 #3s.

    Thought pitch 2 was harder than pitch 1 or V3.  May have been b/c I left one of the #3 cams at the anchor and had to run it out in the upper section more than I'd like.  Pitch 1 sews up, and with all the face holds, the "roof" isn't as hard as it looks.

    Climbed this yesterday and thought the P2 off-hands/fist crack was harder than anything on P1, V3, or Ghetto Cruiser. 5.7? Hmmm...maybe for taller folks or those with big hands. I was burying my arms into that crack and never felt super secure with the jams. I thought the move to the reasonable stance just over halfway up the crack was pretty burly for 5.7. If you like to sew things up like I do, three #3s wouldn't hurt.    P1 was excellent. Great finger crack with solid yet committing laybacks for a couple moves at the crux.

    Gonzo is an excellent, sustained crack climbing route. Next to other 5.8 classics in Eldorado, such as the Long John Wall, Regguae, and Gambit, it easily holds its own and is actually 5.8 for more than just 5-10 feet.    To squeeze even more crack climbing out of the route, one should crawl through the hole at the base of the climb (under the block between V3 and Gonzo, and start from inside. This will add ~10 feet more of beautiful laybacks.

    I thought this route was fantastic.    The second pitch tops out on an awful pile of stacked choss.  The pitch diagonals quite a bit so the belayer is out of harm's way, but being on Deviant or anywhere in that vicinity while someone is up there would be a bad idea.    For the average leader, I would suggest a single set of cams from thin fingers to hand size and doubles of #3 and #3.5 Camalots.  Throw in a set of Stoppers and you should have no problems.    Please leave that poor tree alone!

    Pretty fun route with finger to hands to offwidth size. throwing that right leg into the leaning offwidth up top was awkwardly fun. A couple #3-3.5 Camalots for the top section make things G-rated.     BUT all the loose rock above the route sucked. I ended up belaying from a tree maybe 15 feet above all the loose rock on top and kept worrying if my partner was gonna get taken out by the rope dislodging some death block. Yuck. Is there a better belay at top?
    Nov 3, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Climbed this Saturday, I thought it was better then V3 personally. ?One pitch, long runners, clip the tree to run the rope around the lip of the roof smoothly.  A double rack especially in the 1-3.5 range is nice.  I really enjoyed the second pitch which I had not done before as I had gone on Deviant in the past. Lots of good jambing in the hands/off hands/fists range.  I thought the feet were great as we did this right after Deviant which in comparison is way thinner for the feet.

    Don't place a lot of gear at the bottom, sling them well, and you'll be loving this as a one pitch route without the awkward belay.  Two #2s and #3s were welcome, and I could've put in a #4.

    Climbed 10.6.2007 with S. Costello. Tried this earlier this spring as one pitch and ran out of large pro on the wide 5.7. I would recommend doing the route as two short pitches 1) to avoid a lot of rope drag and 2) have a full rack of big pieces for the second pitch.     Second pitch is especially cool--plenty of arm-jams but scanty feet in places.    There is a great deal of choss at the top of the route--be VERY careful. On my earlier attempt, I managed to knock off a piece and gash the hand of a woman on the ground--if you're reading this, my sincere apology!

    P1: The hard part is short (15-20') culminating in a classic tricky Eldo move to get out of the corner onto the first big ledge. P2: Felt very insecure for a non-crack climber -- I felt more secure leading P1 than following P2. My partner basically used 2 pieces on P2. Hand-sized cam about 10-15' above the belay and then an old blue Camalot (#3 or 4?) that he kept sliding all the way up the crack until almost at the top.
    Jul 21, 2007

    The BIG loose block/flake is still there-lookout!  You may want a good directional on P1 at the top of the block and right at the bottom of the crack.  Your belayer is about 30' from you horizontally at this point.

    Did this route last weekend.  I did the whole route in one pitch with no rope drag. I placed about 4 pieces o n the lower section and [found] that it was actually easier than the upper section.  [Definitely] bring more than one 3 if you want protect it well. I had one 3 and had to run it out quite a bit. Also, at the beginning of the 2nd pitch there is a large loose block wedge in the crack. There is a chalk X marked on it. This block wobbles and is really loose. I had to climb around it making hte climb a little harder than usual.  Give it a try and do it in one pitch. Spare the baby tree:)

    The first pitch of this one is great, the crux feels spicy but protects very well with a red alien. I agree with the 5.8 rating, however compared to V3 (which is also a great route) this route is more difficult technically IMO. In short, take the hike (which is nothing compared to many approaches) and loose the crowds. enjoy!

    I followed P1 and thought it was fun.  I led P2 and thought it was horrid.  The leaning crack made the entire pitch really uncomfortable and harder than most of the 5.8s that I've done.  There are no rests and not much for feet.  In one section the crack becomes too large for jamming adding to the spice.  It looks to me like you have to do P2, I didn't see a way to retreat as some of the comments might suggest. I would love to lead P1 but I felt P2 was really awful.  I probably won't climb this one again anytime soon. -jason

    Don't even need the hexs. Just bring finger and big hand-sized cams. Don't even really worry about bringing the mid-size cams. Also, make your anchor immediately after the traverse so you aren't inclined to use the little tree as a belayer's personal anchor. No telling how long that thing will support people.A fun alternative to the walk-off and/or rapping: Walk north approximately 30' to a large downed pine tree. Downclimb the limbs of the dead tree, carefully placing feet on the limbs as close to the trunk as possible. Gets you RIGHT down to the bottom and a rather fun option as well!~Wm

    watch for  a really loose block in the crack on p. 2.  there is chalk all over the top as testimony that people have pulled here before, but when you jam between the block and wall of the crack you move the block.  After realizing how loose it was, i went out left around it, and that seemed harder than if you pulled on the block for sure, but id hate to rip it out on myself, get hurt, and ruin some poor bastard's day below.Contrary to this web site, i thought gonzo was nicer than V3.

    A great route with two very distinct pitches. The finger crack under the traversing roof of pitch one looks a lot thinner from the ground than it really is and allows for some solid jams. The second pitch is sustained and by the end (at least for me) the crack was even to wide for a solid arm jam. Fun route though. If the approach was roadside it would be climbed everyday.

    Did this today and agree with Brice W. that P2 (7) crack up high felt harder,more sustained, than the P1 crack at (8). Used arm bars in the wide crack up there, as there are no obvious holds to reach for and shakey stances for (7) climbing on P2.  Nonetheless, a good route.  I didn't like the looks of the start to the left of the boulder, so I opted for the same start as V3, to the right of the boulder.  Once on top of this large rock, you can gain the Gonzo crack by traversing the top of the boulder and stepping across a void. I felt this protected better and was a fun start.

    The first pitch felt easy for an Eldo 5.8. There is really only one hard move - and the gear is great for the whole pitch (it might be easier for fat-fingered crack heads). The second pitch felt harder because it is more sustained. At least 2 #3 Camalots for the second pitch as it is sustained at that size. I don't think you need 2 #1 Friends for the first pitch - there are some bomber nut placements and you only need 1 or 2 small cams for the lower section and a couple in the roof, we had green-red Aliens and were fine. Fun climb.    casey bernal

    Fun climb.  Nice to have the crag to ourselves on a busy Saturday afternoon in Eldo.  This climb can be done in one pitch with a 60M rope, but I don't recommend doing that unless you are a fan of rope drag.  To me, the awkward, slanting crack on p2 (5.7 in Rossiter's guide) felt harder than the nice finger crack on pitch 1.  The scramble off is obvious and easy.

    I thought this was a great route, just pray you don't have the Mariah Carey song stuck in your head for the whole pitch.  I stayed just right of the 2nd bolt, which turned out to be pretty blank and definitely felt 5.11.  The 2nd clip was super desperate for me at 5'7".

    If you're tall for the upper moves--around 6'--and climb just left of the first two bolts, this is about 10b.

    Jul 7, 2009
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This pitch is just barely worth doing, for the nice top section. The bottom, where the crux is supposed to be, is contrived: one must force oneself to stay exactly in the bolt line for it to be 5.11b. If you move left and keep hunting for edges, it is maybe 10+, at most. But the top section of bolts is sustained and quite pleasant (10a or 10b).

    I think this route deserves three stars for upward movement and one star for position because it is so easy to reach the 5.7 arete on Emission Control.  It also felt quite a bit easier than 11b on the positive thin edges.

    Brilliant, quite unlike the other face climbs at Cadillac, no bolts to clip! It meanders a bit, double ropes can facilitate combining both pitches and eliminating the hanging belay in the middle. The hardest 5.9 I ever led!

    Great route with continuous climbing on P2 if you go right from the roof.  Every other move is significant, every second stance is rest... it never goes away but never exhausts you.  Exciting but not lethal. A great first "heads up" lead for a 5.10 climber.

    If you are allergic to runouts, pick the right-hand variation on P1 following a small, left-facing corner instead of traversing out left. Doing this, you can clip one bolt on Land of Ra.   If following the suggestion in Rossiter's book about going left to the arete above the roof/bulge on P2, I think this is quite a bit harder than 5.9. Taking a step to the right makes it a 9.

    Rap off the slings to the tree (full 30m), then a quick ~25m to the ground.    Bring lots of small-med gear if leading as one pitch.

    I wouldn't agree that the first pitch is VS. About half way through the scary hand traverse, right below the first bolt of Land of Ra, you an get a bomber #3 Camalot in a hole. It's still spicy, and I wouldn't recommend falling, but this is not a death route. Don't let the first pitch scare you and get on this gorgeous line.
    Jul 5, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    4 things:  1-the "runout fun" is not over after your pitch one traverse. P2 has plenty of spice left. This is not a good route for the fledgling .9 leader.  2-I echo the great idea of bringing a 3.5 and 4 for the traverse crack on P1.  3-Bring doubles of red, yellow, green Aliens for building your anchor on the arete, or sm/med. tri-cams.  4-rapelling (with 2 ropes) certainly beats the alternative loose, steep downclimb.    Finally-I pulled an autolocker off 'Land of Ra' on 8/4/06. If you can describe it, it's yours.

    Climbed on 10/9. Great route. I would have to agree that the first pitch is X though it is fairly mellow face climbing. A fall before reaching the secure finger crack would not end well. As for the second pitch, I am not sure what the original line is but skirting to the right seems more in line with a 5.9 rating than going straight up.
    Oct 15, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Another crux comment.  I'm sure we cheated the route by moving farther right, to "Land of Ra" and proceeding up and then left to the arete, but the move straight up is 5.10 tricky and a little run out (potential 20 foot whipper.)  Having said that, I certainly appreciate the sandbag gifts of our predecessors, it keeps Eldo real and interesting.

    I agree with Luke. You have to beware any 9+ rating put up in the 70's.  Nobody wanted to give a route a ten and then given a bunch of shit for it. That's my interpretation.9+ is a dubious grade in any climbing area.
    Aug 20, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Not that this site really needs another rating argument but I think the 9+ rating in Rossiter's guide for this route is a classic Eldo sandbag the hardmen of the 70s bequeathed to us. I was crushed on the crux -- leading and on top rope -- and I have been leading 10b and c in Eldorado. The 10b Ichiban Arete felt much easier than this line, which we intended as a *warm-up.* This is harder 9+ than p1 of Rincon.

    I led the fist pitch of this route a couple of days ago and it is great.  I would mention the long runout after the hand tranverse left up to the crack.  If you're solid on 5.8 it just takes a cool head.  But it is a 15-20 foot runout and the last piece is somewhat suspect.

    No way this thing is "R" on anything more than 5.6 climbing. You can place good gear before leaving the dihedral, and from there, it's hand over hand across a very large and positive handrail before reaching a bomber nut and #1 placement for the mantle to the first bolt. From there, it's well-protected by bolts until the arete where the difficulty eases off significantly. Higher on the arete, you can even get a great #3 in a hueco to protect the final few moves to the top.     Don't let the rating scare you off, it's great face climbing with good protection for all of the more difficult climbing!

    I agree with Ivan above. Compared to Deviant, Highway of Diamonds, Chockstone, Xanadu, and other 10a routes in Eldo, Ichiban is a bit easier. Gearwise, I would put it at PG. Mostly you get great gear (and you can even back up a bolt with a great nut!), but there is a small runout section. However, there's nothing to hit if falling.
    Jul 12, 2011

    I like it spicy!  Don't put another bolt in, it's pretty obvious what you're getting into from safety; it's a choice to go up or not, if you're not feeling it, rap off!    Also, a #1 C4 goes in well after the initial right traverse on the quest over to the bolt.    At the top, there is a bolted anchor at the top of The Untitled in addition to the top anchor.  The top anchor has a long cordelette and a large quicklink, and the Untitled anchor has rings.    @Gregg: Sounds like your disappointment stems not from the lack of quality of IB, but frustration with your inability to sack up and lead The Untitled. Since IB is well below your ability, pretend, for a moment, that some other climbers don't TR .12 like you can, and that leading a .10/.9+ face route with an exciting runout is fun!    Good route, Richard!

    Compared to nearby sandbag 9+'s Deviant and Highway of Diamonds, this climb is very easy. With double ropes, the initial traverse is safe and not at all scary. I then downclimbed a bit and traversed out. I didn't see the Tri Cam placement that Tony mentioned, but there's a sinker brass nut in the thin vertical crack to protect the move up to the first bolt.I clipped my left rope a little too high up the corner and so had some drag after I rounded the arete. It would have been better to clip the left rope to the nut in the corner and then to the 3rd rather than 2nd or 1st bolts and clip the right bolt to a nut (optional) and 1st and 2nd bolts.
    Jul 7, 2009

    Worth doing if you like the dicey lead. Go up the gulley from the tree, not out to the funky looking bolt to right of the tree. Place gear in the corner, then traverse right to good holds (don't fall!). Work your way to the bottom bolt in the line on the 12a route, then veer off right (crux) to a bolt near the arete. If you then step right onto the arete, it is a long way to the next bolt, but very fun, easy climbing.

    Great little line on excellent rock.  Yes, the first bolt clip and the upper section should both be considered RO (though the climbing is easy).  Also, there is no way that this route is 10b - solid 9+ (and a very short crux at that). Adding a bolt is unnecessary (though the old rap anchors and their position are questionable).
    Sep 30, 2005

    An extra bolt might not hurt the route, I guess. If it doesn't get placed, or until it does, you can put good gear in. Just take your Lowe tricams &amp; look for the pocket. My partner and I both though it was bomber.

    Followed this today and we found the initial clip way [runout].  My leader threaded a runner off a branch on the fir tree...as the first clip is a ways up, with no other apparent pro.

    Joyce (my wife of the time) and I did this route and The Untitled nearly 20 years ago.  I went back up and climbed these routes during the summer of 2002.  The initial stretch above the "belay tree" is really bogus and needs an additional bolt.  Also the anchors at the top of the tower are not in a useful place and should probably be relocated at the top of face of The Untitled.  This is a case of 20-20 hindsight.  Please realize that 20 years ago "sport climbing" was in its infancy and the concept of lowering off from a climb was nearly unknown.  One simply led the pitch, brought up the second, then walked off or rappelled.  It was an extension of mountaineering.      Cadillac Crag is not in Eldorado Canyon State Park, nor is it in Boulder Mountain Parks.  I believe this crag lies in a narrow stretch of BLM land and is not subject to the bolting restrictions of either agency.  I may very well return and upgrade the fixed gear as is logical by modern standards.

    ICHIBAN!!!  yeah Mark, I thought the same thing about the grade, super cool route though.  Bolts en route are new and draws will do for pro if you don't mind running it out a bit. Those bolts on top are starting to look pretty ancient and they are sharp, check the webbing..

    I did this route several years ago and found it easy for 5.10b.  Climbing up the arete is fun and very exposed.  You can stick a cam (#3 Camalot, I think) in one of the pockets as psychological pro if you want, but I don't advise falling here.      The rappel bolts are in a odd spot, but for what its worth, you can rig a toprope from them for the untitled 5.12 (which is decent climb) with a little webbing.

    It is also quite possible to place a reasonably good Lowe tricam prior to reaching the bolts.  It is the red one, if I recall correctly, but it has been years...  I carry only pink, red, brown, so it has to be one of those.

    This is a great, sustained route! However, the crux is one move max, and I don't think that it is a 5.11a move. I may be biased though because I am taller, but the move was over before you knew it. That being said, the route doesn't let up at any point. Be on your game for this one because you really have to go for it and navigating wasn't easy. The seam up top takes some wire (I slotted a #9 and was PSYCHED) and microcams. Control yourself in the beginning so you don't have rope drag with will f%$k you at the end of the route. The SMC bolts add a bit of spice into the equation as well. All said, what a great route. Get on it!

    Made the same mistakes as Gregg Russo.      Clipped the first three bolts and while staring into the sun climbed up past the 4th bolt while following the natural line of gear placements.  Pulled over the two bulges(10-)  and then traversed right back to bolt 4 or 5 but encountered heinous rope drag. Climbed back to the arete and ran it out over moderate (but run out) terrain to the bolted anchor.  Keeping true to the route would have trended up and right more than seems logical from the 3rd bolt.    I'm sure we weren't the first to make this mistake and so thought a logical name to this variation is Land of Diamonds.    Rapping from the bolted anchors with a 60m rope left us with about a 8 ft down climb to the tree...be careful!

    Fabulous, long pitch. The upper "crack" is not 9+. Ichiban Arete, which we did just before is rated 10b (maybe 10a). The incipient crack above the 10c move is continuous/harder than any move on Ichiban Arete; it is difficult to lead while protecting safely, especially if you put the gear in the few places you might have gotten a finger lock. You want to be solid at placing gear and leading about 10b for this bit, or you need to bail out to the left and up the arete, as some have done (9+ S, maybe). Also, the guys above are quite right: the safest way to do the traverse moves to bolt #1 is how they describe, with trad. gear up and right in the dihedral. Finally, 60 m rope indeed gets you about 10 feet above the belay tree, with 5.4 downclimb to it.

    Jul 6, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    The previous info was very helpful, and I'll just add a few comments. Near the start, I climbed up to the top of the shallow, left-facing dihedral, placed protection (with a long runner), climbed back down, and then went directly up to the first bolt.  Even with the gear in the dihedral, a #3 Camalot in a pocket below the bolt (with a double length sling) was welcome. The slot for the #4 Camalot was between the third and fourth bolt, and shortened the long runout getting up to the fourth bolt.  This is a great route.
    Nov 16, 2005
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree with Gary, the shallow dihedral is a perfectly acceptable way to avoid the serious face move to the first bolt, and should be considered a variation for the quality of the left-traversing moves.  I love this route.  The anchor bolts should be moved to the solid block three feet above to avoid the sharp, loose edge.  A 60m rope is sufficient to reach the tree between the 2nd and 3rd fin, and will get you almost all the way to the belay tree for Ichiban with an easy five-foot downclimb.

    The ground-fall potential on this route prior to clipping  the first bolt is pretty high and I found it more  comfortable to lead this by climbing the shallow  dihedral just right of the face moves to the bolt, placing  pro in the dihedral's crack and then traversing almost  directly left to the bolt.  The rest of the pitch is one of the nicest face pitches around, with good pro.
    Apr 5, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I agree it is an excellent pitch of sustained slab climbing. The 9+ crack/seam at the top does take wires and small cams, but the gear placements take some work. Also, do *not* fall on the 5.8 moves up to the first bolt.  This would be a bad pendulum that would slam you into a slab.

    There really aren't too many quality one pitch climbs of this grade in Eldorado. I thought this was quite fun and has a lot of interesting stemming between the cracks on the right and the corner. It is worth nothing that the detatched block (that a beginning leader might be tempted to place gear in) on the right immediately following the stump, moves a bit and will not take reliable protection despite its appearance. As soon as you pass this block, there is a solid single crack that will take a good finger-sized piece.

    This climb is much better than it looks, and I thought it was a lot of fun. If you want more of a challenge, climb the finger crack on the right side before stemming into the corner. Only downside is that it is a little grassy.

    Maybe it was just because I hadn't warmed up, but I got pretty pumped on this.  As with all routes in this area, there is a ton of loose rock piled up on top.  The stump should be either removed or sharpened to a fine point for beginning leader kabobs.

    This is an OK route, much easier than P2 of Gonzo. I don't think this gets climbed often. In the dihedral crack, there's a bit of vegetation and dirt. Makes the feet "interesting" when there's not much on the face. Lots of loose rock at the top. Be careful when belaying from above.

    Copy Ivan's comments above. Compared to Deviant, Highway of Diamond, Chockstone, Xanadu, and other 10a in Eldo, I think Moonlight Drive is a bit easier. There's a bunch of suspect rock on the first pitch, bit being careful, you only need to touch one suspect rock (the very large flake) while climbing it at 5.8 level. Just avoid the big suspect jugs and use the smaller and more stable features. Gear can also be placed away from the suspect stuff with a bit of imagination. Make sure your second is a solid climber as the traverse (5.6?) at the top of P1 doesn't have a lot of solid gear.
    Jul 12, 2011

    Great climb. Both pitches are on the spicy side but not bad.  I enjoyed this climb more than both V3 and Gonzo.  Definitely don't agree with the description of "A good climb for sure, but nothing spectacular."  The flake on P1 is cool.  I don't think it's going anywhere, but I also didn't even think of place any pro behind it. I got a suspect #2 Metolius curved nut in on P2 between the 3rd and 4th bolt, but it was probably just mental help.
    Sep 27, 2008

    I agree with Ivan.  "As for the gear between bolts 3 and 4, it is indeed at your feet. I used a #00 Metolius."  I used a blue Alien.    I also found this and Ichiban Arete about as difficult as Deviant. For the record I think Deviant is 10a easy.
    Aug 9, 2008

    I didn't think the runout between bolts was too bad. It would be an uncomfortable fall, but not a dangerous one. I found the suspect rock on  P1 more spicy than anything else on the route.
    May 4, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Read all the comments. Good route indeed, but everyone who says watch out on p. 1 is quite right. Very suspect little holds, and the big flake is going to break if you pull out and hard on it. We all know it is possible to rate things differently, and maybe the folks who say p. 2 is 5.9 went some different way. The way we did it, definitely 10b. Also I said "R" as you do NOT want to fall at the 9+ move just before you clip the 4th/last bolt on the arete - pretty run out at that point (previous bolt maybe 25 feet down).
    Sep 10, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I lead this today having followed it a year or two ago. It seemed very easy. The first pitch is maybe 5.7. The big flake was more solid than I remembered. The rock on the traverse left is atrocious--don't pull out on anything, but the gear is pretty good, and the climbing is very easy if you stay low. The crux is on positive 1/2 joint or bigger hand holds and pretty big feet, and is all in balance. One standup move is all. I had followed Deviant (9+) that morning and had more trouble following that than leading this. As for the gear between bolts 3 and 4, it is indeed at your feet. I used a #00 Metolius.
    Nov 18, 2006

    "No harder than 5.9"  I just don't get it (my partner said the same thing, "5.9").  I think it is solid 10- for 3 moves.  Also, this route should be considered S (Serious), due to the exfoliating/thin/rotten nature of several sections in P1 and the RO in P2. . . . at least remember this warning (and the others) if you're using this website as beta.Really fun climb - and exciting for the grade!
    Oct 1, 2005

    If you didn't find any gear between the third and fourth bolts, it's because it's at your feet when you're standing on the big ledge.  Set two opposing small stoppers.  Maybe it was the comfort of clipping bolts, but the second pitch seemed no harder than 5.9.  I certainly concur with all the [trepidation] expressed over the first pitch death flakes.  Pull carefully.

    The move from the third bolt to the fourth bolt is not too bad minus the wind guts which really sucked. I didn't see any placements between these bolts at all. Pick a calm day to do this.

    This is one of my favorite pitches.  Tons of fun!  The flake on P1 is a blast, but placing gear is sometimes hard as you have to contort around to see it.  I'll aslo concur that the final 10-15 feet is a)S, and b) has some suspect rock in places (thin flakes waiting for their chance to go) and c) really fun.  I doubled up on a couple of placements right out of the crack and felt OK about it.  Don't head right to the roof; the bolts are a bit lower.I blew off stringing the 2 Ps together, therefore making  my partner pull the cruxes, but I regret that.  I think with long slings, they'd go together withough THAT MUCH drag.     When you get to the top, hit Midnight Trundler if you're so inclined.    Enjoy!

    This is a superb route! Climbing the P1 flake is excellent... to an airy hanging belay.  I have to say the P2 (10b) face is fairly graded, and a very worthy pitch of Cadillac fin climbing...
    Oct 4, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Great Route!  P1 is moderately long  60-70 feet.  Some suspect rock, that could be pryed loose with poor cam placements.  IMHO not a great first lead for a 5.8 leader.  20 foot traverse left to the anchors if an onsight would be would be quite serious trying to route find because anchors can not be seen from last pro placement.P2- after Bolt 3, I was able to place a Blue Alien and Black/Blue Alien in a small slot on the ledge and equalize them with a sling.  Either one on it's own with a higher impact fall would probably fracture the rock and you would take 40-50 ft fall, equalized they would likely hold, however the climbing is not that difficult getting to the bolt, unless there are 40-50 mph wind gusts?    Save a 3, 3.5 or 4 Camalot for the top.    I have climbed several routes at Cadillac, and this is one of the best.
    Sep 21, 2003

    This is a great climb!  The first pitch flake is cool - unique and fun.  The runout traverse to the anchors isn't too bad (S-).  Keep in mind that it's likewise S- for the follower.  Pitch 2 is superb - airy and exposed on quality rock.  It's peculiar (to me anyway) that the first ascentionists placed 3 bolts to protect the first 20' of this pitch, then ran it 30' to the 4th bolt!  The difficulty eases to about 5.7 for this stretch, but a 60' fall past your belayer would be, well...exciting to say the least.  I found a marginal smaller nut placement (#5 BD?) about half way between the 3rd and 4th bolts in a tiny pocket, but was sure glad to clip that last bolt.  Used a .5 Camalot and yellow TCU to protect from there to the top.    Airy and exposed!

    Re my first comments.  I led this pitch after following it the year earlier, so I think my comments are affected by that.

    I agree with Steve and Bryson.  I remember leading the first pitch and being pretty nervous about taking a big fall in the final 10' .  After Pete's comment I figured I was just being a wimp, or was missing some placements.

    I would concur with Bryson. The 1st pitch is rather spicy and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to a 5.8 leader. I do think the route is well worth the long approach when you're comfortable at this degree-of-difficulty.
    Aug 23, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    To me this did not seem like a good moderate lead up to the bolt anchor. There are some very suspect flakes above the wheat thin flake that are waiting to be pulled off onto someone's rope. This may be a moderate lead for someone more accustomed to ice climbing but anyone at their limit on 5.8 has a good chance of pulling something big off. I strung both pitches together without drag problems and thought the upper part was pretty good but found the bottom half to be rather dangerous and definitely not worth a trip in it's own right
    Aug 22, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    With the rap anchors at the top of the first pitch, this makes for an excellent moderate lead at about 5.8+ (Rossiter).  The pro is fine with the exception of the top traverse, which is easy, the position airy, the flakes very funky.  Just be aware that you'll need to traverse left before you reach the top of the roof in order to get to the anchors, and you'll have to place some funky pro to protect your second.  (I used a pink tri cam and a small camalot).

    Was able to fiddle in two small offset brassies and a red ball nut in the lower 5' of the dihedral, but it pinches shut completely after that, so be prepared to run it out. I mantled onto the good flake/crimp on the right wall before deciding that the lead was too much and backing down. You won't hit the ground falling out of the dihedral (if the gear holds), but you will need a high level of confidence in your small gear as it will be holding quite a fall if you do blow it near the top.

    Another of many mismatches between Rossiter's rating in the text and what it says on the topo. The text says 11d, but the topo shows an 11b crux down low, and an 11a crux higher. Needed a magnifying glass to read the notations on the topo.
    Nov 9, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Actually, Rossiter's latest Eldo book rates this 5.11d. I'd have to agree that it is easier- and perhaps easier still because yesterday I snapped off the sharp part of the crux hold and it got better. I tend to sacrifice a little strength for security and lean back hard to make my feet stick better- I leaned back on the diagonal crimp and 'pop' now it's a little different. My partner, who normally has to grovel a bit on climbs harder than 5.11b came up it clean without too much struggle, despite hot/humid conditions.    Building a good anchor up top while keeping the rope off of sharp edges is a little problematic, build it to avoid cutting your rope in the event of a fall.    Neat route.  P1 breaks charicter from P2, but both are fun.

    Located on the west face of fin 3, just right of the beautiful dihedral of V3.    Approximately 140 feet in length. With rope stretch, an 80 meter rope will just get you to the ground if your belayer steps into the starting alcove. TIE A KNOT.    13 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor. A #3 Camalot w a runner placed between bolts 1&amp;2 is wise, if you were to slip or botch clipping the 2nd bolt, you'd certainly hit the ground from 30+ feet.    Once established on the face, after the 2nd bolt, this route is incredibly sustained. I thought there were two distinct cruxes- a 12c section getting from bolts 3 to 4, and a 12b section just past the 11th bolt. While there are a few areas of respite in which to shake out your calves, the majority of the climbing never falls much below 11+/12-.     A superb route, great stone, super sustained for 140', strong toes and calves would be a huge asset.

    Funny that I have never checked out this thread before, but here is Bret's and my version of what occurred that day.  Bret contacted me the previous day about coming up to Cadillac Crag to climb what has now been called either Fuzzy Dice or Untitled.  I agreed.  We wanted to try and drill the route on the lead, ground up.  As far as Bret (or I) knew, no one else had ever been on this route before although we knew that Richard had been checking out various lines in the area.  To the best of our knowledge, this was not one of them. We never saw any chalk marks on our proposed line.  We got to the foot of the climb, Bret allowed me the first attempt at leading and drilling.  I had gotten the first bolt in and was above it contemplating the next when Joyce came rappelling from up above.  Bret and I were naturally confused and a bit upset, because we figured that their intent was to rap bolt and we wanted first chance at a trad lead.    Bret and I had a quick discussion with Joyce and it was obvious she and Richard were intent on drilling from above.  Bret and I didn't think we could finish the route that day and might have to return again the next.  Everyone agreed to a truce.  The route would get drilled from rappel if Richard and Joyce gave Bret and I the first chance at the redpoint.  Richard drilled the bolts, I did the first redpoint.  When I got to the top, Richard and Joyce were no where to be seen.  Bret followed the lead and he and I went home.    We never top roped the route nor did we ever see an Elaine Chandler.    I think what probably happened was that Richard had placed anchors above several routes on that cliff and had previously TR'ed them with intentions to go back and establish the bolts.  He was really ambitious back them and sometimes didn't always communicate his intentions to others.  Bret simply saw a great line he wanted to climb.  At the time, Bret and I were holdouts (of a sort) of trad climbing.  We really wanted to see if we could drill this rock on the lead.  Hence, our stubbornness at not giving in to Richard's claim that it was his route. I was pretty adamant that I was NOT going to give in.  Richard was surprised and ticked-off.    That was a long time ago, and everyone has since changed.  We're all friends now, and this story is just part of the interesting history of Eldorado climbing.  The name "Fuzzy Dice" was Bret's idea and a good name.  I think that Richard and Joyce's name should remain on the FA.

    To Steve.  Now that this whole story has been told, I just want to say that I am easy on it.  Fuzzy Dice is a clever name and I don't really mind at this point if people call it that.  This is an excellent and challenging route on very good rock.  I would like to return to this face with a drill and make a few improvements:  it needs a first bolt behind the tree and a 2-bolt anchor at the top of the face.  The current anchor is up on the summit and makes a poor rap or lower-off.  A first bolt behind the tree would also serve the route Ichi Ban Arete.  I, of course, heard about your stroke on Spearhead.  I hope you are doing better now and I expect you are!  Best wishes Steve and thanks for your many contributions to the sport.

    Sorry for the misinformation Richard.  The story I heard (which you state is incorrect) is that Jack and Bret were the first to free climb (i.e. redpoint) this line, and had named it Fuzzy Dice.

    I have never published the story behind this route, because it is not a very pretty one.  But the [previously posted] misinformation presented here compels some explanation.  During the summer of 1988, I had set anchor bolts at the top of the northwest face of the First Fin, Cadillac Crag.  Joyce (my wife of the time), Karen Kuddes and myself toproped the face and determined the ideal line.  I marked in chalk where I thought the bolts should be placed and we rapped off, planning to return the nest day and set the bolts.  When we returned we found Jack Roberts and Bret Ruckman toproping the face from our anchors with the intent of bolting the route.  I agreed to include them in the project and placed the bolts with my Bosch, as I had planned.  We all climbed the route.  I later found out that a friend of ours, Elaine Chandler, had come by earlier that day and told Roberts and Ruckman that we were already working on the route and planned to return.      Regard this as you will.  Personally I feel that my including Roberts and Ruckman in the first ascent was an act of good will.  I named this route The Untitled because I never felt comfortable with the circumstances of the first ascent.  The correct name of this route is The Untitled and the FA should read: Joyce and Richard Rossiter, Jack Roberts and Bret Ruckman

    Good long moderate and very enjoyable (minus the bird poop). A couple of spots will definitely put you a bit above your last piece, but the moves are straightforward. I liked having 2 #3, 2 #2s, and doubles in off finger sizes too. A #4 was nice to have up top. Solid 5.8 and worth the hike.
    Oct 11, 2016
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A #4 Camalot would definitely help at the top. I saw anchor rings at the top right. To end the climb, I traversed left and belayed off a tree.

    I led this route yesterday (7/13/14), and it was super fun. I'd do it again for sure. I used crack system and jammed fingers and feet all the way. For a small person like myself, the last 10ft or so was kind of like a baby offwidth, but I jammed my entire legs and used my body as a cam. Gonzo and V3 are must 5.8 routes in this crag!

    Good climb, sustained, and straightforward for Eldo.  #4 certainly helps for the top section.

    Fun route that I really struggled with, much more difficult than Gambit and upper Gambit variation.
    Oct 31, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Awkward five 8. Three of us did it all with different tactics. I did less stemming and more foot jamming and it was fun! Bear hug near the top.
    Jun 17, 2011
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I followed this pitch so maybe my perception is a bit skewed, but I thought Ghetto Cruiser was noticeably harder. I didn't find V3 to be very sustained either. I found that jamming the crack was pretty secure, so I didn't stem too much at all. Would like to go back and see what it's like on lead.
    Jun 28, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Bird poo central, but that just add to the ambiance, right? Probably the easiest 5.8 I've been on in my life. A few backsteps and minor stems make it a cinch.
    Jun 27, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    A 70m will put you at a nice stance about 15 feet off the ground, easy downclimbing.  Just watch your ends on the way down!    As for the route, probably my favorite pitch of 5.8 ever!  Not too sustained, good gear, great movement.  I had a single #4 and used it before the 'double wide crack' section at the top.  Another would have been nice for the head, but it's pretty easy ground.  You can avoid the hanging belay by going straight back from the top of the climb onto the next headwall, plenty of cracks to make your own anchor.  Or the tree at the top of Gonzo, although it's a bit out of the line of the climb.
    Mar 8, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Regarding the comment that a 70m rope is too short.  Too short for what?  It is an easy walk off to climbers left from the top.  No need to rappel this one.
    Jan 18, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Was able to climb this today, in January!  I love living in Colorado!    Turned out to be an amazing day of 50ish degree sunshine.    We used a 70 meter rope and it was too short.  However, it was sufficient enough to get us to comfortable downclimbing spot.    Also, when you set up anchors at the top, you can place a few directional draws on the way down for the 5.11b next to it!  Great fun.
    Jan 18, 2010
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Climbed this last week.  Really fun climb.  For the anchor on top, I was able to run an open loop of rope to an anchor around the large pine about 20 feet back from the top of V3.  By clove hitching it back to my harness, I was able to sit right on the edge and watch my second the whole time without having to hang off the awkward-looking bolt anchor.  This was with a 60m rope.
    Jun 18, 2008
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Climbed yesterday and loved it.  A few cruxes with ample protection.  The bird shit exists and the wind was deafening, however despite the complaints on the top anchor, the hanging belay on the right wasn't terrible and the following walk-off was easy.  Choose between walk-off and a double rope rappel.  Have Fun!

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Climbed 10/6/07 with S. Costello. This is a fine, high-quality pitch. Keep the #4 cam for the wide bit. I was surprised to find my #2 and #1 Camalots still on my rack when I finished it. There are numerous excellent nut placements and a lot of good spots for medium to large hexes (#6-#12) if you've got them.    The fixed anchor is not so good and would require a hanging belay. Unfortunately there are not many options for a trad anchor either. Beware the choss!
    Oct 8, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Loads of thick, gooey bird crap up near where the .9 variation rejoins the dihedral (7/20/07). We chose to cut left onto Heartbreaker [aka Never Cry Wolf], a superb, thin face climb.
    Jul 20, 2007
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I onsighted this one today and just had a great time. I linked both pitches, but unfortunately ran out of slings. Definitely keep that #4 for when the crack gets wide and splits before a large chockstone you have to haul on to get over. If you use it lower like I did, you can bury a #2 deep to the left. You can get a nut in on the right side of the chockstone before you climb over it. And from time to time see if you can stem the feature instead of puting your feet in the crack. Some awesome no hands rests that way.

    The bird shit was not there the first time I climbed this route (many years ago), but it was there yesterday.  Let's hope for some heavy rain....

</blockquote><blockquote>
    Led this route today just after leading the first pitch of Gonzo. It felt definitely harder than Gonzo P1. Long, very sustained, and it looks like there are several cruxes on the route. IMHO, it is better not to use the anchor at the top at all, it looks quite shitty and hard to reach.
    May 21, 2006
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Great route! I chose the non-stemming option while leading this one. I am just getting into finger cracks and found this one a good intro to finger jams and toe work (if not stemming). I did not bring big gear (i.e., the # 4 discussed above) and felt fine. However, without a big piece (hex or cam) the last set of moves out right to the bolts will be EXPOSED and a run out, but the climbing is easier at that point. Enjoy!

    My first climb in Eldo. I thought this was a great climb! Definitely sustained. A little easier than it looked but good fun sustained crack. And the approach ain't that bad compared to other areas I've been to. Look forward to many more climbs in Eldo.
    Nov 14, 2004
</blockquote><blockquote>
    [Beautiful] long pitch !!!  If you are not comfortable with runout sections definitely bring an extra #4 or two aside from your standard rack.  As mentioned above the moves through the [runout aren't] very hard.  I only brought a #3 Camalot and used it early on in the pitch. Awesome route, fun, long, thought provoking lead. Oh yeah when I was there I clipped a fixed nut and about 15-20 feet up a fixed red Camalot. Couldn't get it out though.!!! Enjoy - PEEEEAAAAACE out!!
    Oct 15, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Three stars all the way. Solid rock, sustained climbing, and even a shady belay stance! Easy walk-off to the left.
    Jul 18, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    As mentioned, very similiar to Veschneidung, only longer.  Crux for me was in the middle involving lay backing, while walking up the steep wall. As with Verschneidung, because of the angle of the V, you can use your back to pressure your feet against the wall in this section. Didn't see much to stem with there.  Higher, a #4 is needed to sew it up completely, but I climbed it without one, as that move is not that difficult. Top third of this route is pretty casual, the meat is in the middle. Quite a hike up to this crag, but a morning start has you in the cool summer shade, enjoying killer views west to the Divide.
    Jul 17, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    This route is kinda like Triple-S at Seneca in the sense that if you don't stem, it's hard.  If you do stem, there are still some moves to consider, but a rest between almost every one of them.
    Apr 3, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Led this yesterday and thought the climb was pretty sustained for it's grade (maybe it was the 50mph gusts and cool temps).  An awesome climb, nonetheless.  A note about the fixed stopper:  if you're counting on using it, it's gone (I removed it with hardly any work).  I wouldn't consider the pro tricky there anyway, as previously mentioned, or anywhere else on the route.Also, the double bolt anchors atop Trail of Tears are not set up for rapping (needs webbing or chains), and the belay isn't that comfortable.

    I tried leading this climb 3 weeks ago.  There's a fixed stopper about 25 feet above the large block.  After moving above this stopper, I was unable to get a good piece of pro in.  The crack there is kinda weird and I didn't want to go higher without a piece.  So, after fiddling with gear for way to long, I fell on the fixed stopper.  I was unable to get the climb that day.    I just went back and tried it again this weekend.  The gear is better above that fixed stopper, I just didn't go up high enough.  After finishing the lead, here are my comments:  I agree with the other posts, the gear placements are all there, but sometimes a little difficult to find or require a slightly strenuous stance to place it.  The V is at an angle that is a little less than 90 degrees.  So it can get tight, and your gear can get in the way.  It is a pretty long pitch, so bring enough gear, and endurance.  I used most of my 50m rope.  The wide cracks at the top were not so much a problem for me as the lower sections.  I found 2 distinctive crux sections, both relatively sustained, both about 20-25 feet, and both below the wide cracks near the top.  Comparing this climb to other 5.8s, I found it to be a little bit harder, especially for a beginining leader (like me) because of the tricky pro and narrow, tight space.  But this was my first 5.8 lead in Eldo.    I really enjoyed this climb.  It's usually empty, and definitely worth the hike.    Great climb.    Solid 5.8

    Awesome climb! Brice, you are right on--althought the gear is superb and always right where you want it, placing gear is definitely thoughtful--its not your normal plug-and-chug line. althought it looks line a tight finger crack from the ground, the crack eats up medium cams (green BD, etc), and definitely bring hand size and a larger piece up top (#4 Friend baaarely works), or else you'll be looking at quite a runout.    Also, anyone know if trail crews are gonna hit up Cadillac Crag? It's pretty loose, and I'm so used to nicely terraced benches and steps (Eldo is spoiled :) I saw them working on northern Rincon earlier in the summer, so maybe they're workin' down the line.
    Oct 13, 2002
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Great climb, it's like the V-slot on Verschneidung, but longer.  Note to budding trad leaders:  the climb protects well, except for the wide crack at the top (though it didn't feel too hard there).  If you want to sew that up, two #4 Camalots would do the trick.  There are good stances for placing gear, but in places the crack is a bit funky and takes a little more thought than just throwing in a cam or nut.
    Aug 22, 2002

    I led the route yesterday and it ranks as one of my Eldo favorites.  I enjoyed it so much that I followed my climbing partner on the same route just minutes after the first climb.  I also want to do the finger crack variation.
    Jul 2, 2001
</blockquote><blockquote>
    I did this route again, this time with the 5.9 finger crack variation.  The variation is fun, but not too long and pretty easy for the grade IMHO.  I thought it compared in difficulty to the rest of the route (maybe only slightly harder).      Also, some gear advice: some tricams (0.5, 1) work well and bring a #4 Camalot if you have one to protect a section near the end with two wide cracks on either side.  Otherwise, you'll have to run it out slightly, but if you feel comfortable on 5.8 terrain, don't worry about the extra weight.
    Jun 4, 2001

    Followed this today and what a cool pitch....sustained and long for Eldo. I wanna go back and lead that nice finger crack in the left wall and also Deviant, which looks HARD....saw this strong looking dude hanging on it today.....there's no feet. Led the 2nd pitch of Over the Hill today too, that finger crack has been calling me for the last 2 weeks and finally got to nail it today, very recommended!!

    I don't know that was a cupped hands crack and I had no three, did the whole thing on one tipped out two.  The exit from the slot was awesome and technical.  Great line and dont forget to protect your second.

    w/J. Blumberg 3.18.06...there are some weird moves on this climb. Lots of them. It's a good practice route for, well, other weird routes. Standard rack was sufficient. Beward the choss-pile at the belay.
    Mar 19, 2007

    Lots of loose rock undermines what is otherwise a great climb.  Bring extra number #1-3 Camalots for the hand crack.  Great climb in the fall.

    I'll second AC comment regarding being short: at 5'3", I thought that going over the roof was particularly difficult.  Stemming was not an easy option.  That was the crux for me.
    Apr 13, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Wow!  Pulling out and over into the crack from the slot is puzzling, and a blast! Having doubles of #3 Camalot was nice.
    Apr 2, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    1 or perhaps 2 stars, but 3 is a bit optimistic.
    Mar 17, 2003
</blockquote><blockquote>
    Very good climb! The line looks somewhat improbable from below--and intimidating, but it's not bad once youre into it.    Bring an extra hand sized piece and a #3 Camalot for the hand crack--if you're short and not too solid on jamming, the hand crack section will be brutal. But if you're tall you can jam and stem pretty easily for good rests along the slot. The crux felt to be the few moves out of the deep slot where the hand crack jaunts out on to the licheny face above, and finishes into the finger crack. This section [isn't] hard, just a little tricky and the lichen makes it slippery--and I also had a pretty good pump going!

    Decent route with a fun and improbably crux. Hard to commit to, but not so hard to do once committed. The climb is 5.11 and does have O.W. on it, but it's not 5.11 O.W. Or at least that's not how I did the crux.  The rack is "up to a #4 Camalot" with wide gear optional before or instead of the bolt.  The route goes without the bolt on a #4.5 Camalot... but recall that those were not on the market in 1986 when this route was FA'd.
